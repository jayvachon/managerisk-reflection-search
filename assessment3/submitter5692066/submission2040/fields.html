    <h1>Submission 2040 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5692066, session_user_id: 911b4607dac4b5ff3fd961d199bf9a9a5938cc92)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Level 4: jSfcVSk<br /><br />Just by plying the game the first time is possible to related the concepts of risk management to the game development, and strategies one have to take to complete the different levels.  The immediate effect of risk preparation have over development  is clearly represented by the progress bar, when trying to improve your risk protection the bar turns yellow/red really quickly almost immediate depending of your development growth rate.<br /><br />After playing the game more than once  always went for the insurance first, but as I learn the game tactics, in the first levels didn't try to improve protection and try to empower development. When reaching good development growth rate I started to improve risk protection.<br /><br />A way to improve the game would be to simulate the difficulty around community connections, how they can be chaotic and slowdown communication and reactions, or they can improve the flow of coping with a "shock".  One of the most challenging problem my community have is the creation of organizations and the way they communicate to each other, to keep a proper workflow to cope emergency and achieve excellent  execution.  <br /><br /><br /></div>
