    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game we had to manage money for repairing, insurance, upgrading, new pods, raising land. All these had to be managed simultaneously otherwise it had bad results. This game clearly depicted that the people had to be prepared well before the comets hit. Taking risk with building more pods or upgrading them was bit tricky. This was the role of risk management in the game. <br />Building more pods without raising the land or getting insured was one of the risk which people have to avoid. Insurance was the first thing which i did to insure that i need not pay the whole amount of repairing. In terms of knowledge i researched the comets which increased the research bar and decreased the severity of hit. For protection, my first step was to get insured and then i started raising the land according to the comet's severity which was coming, this helped me in several ways, raising land helped me to stop getting my pods damaged and insurance helped me in the worst situation were my pods get damaged. While preparing for risk my development rate was affected severely as i didn't had much cash left to upgrade pods.<br /><br />If i played the game only once and if i was to play it again i would definitely focus on preparing for risk and at the same time expanding my territory. <br />After playing the game once, in the second chance i focused on preparing for the risk more than expanding my society early. <br />There was a very important piece of knowledge which i gained from this game, that is preparing for the risk is very important. If we only focus on development without preparing for the calamities, our society will be drastically damaged. It is very important to manage the risk preparation and development simultaneously. The basic idea behind this game was to develop the society and at the same time prepare for the worse calamities and survive those. Being insured is also very important, if the calamity is beyond our preparation then insurance will help us to revive a whole lot of amount that is lost. During the preparation of calamity, the rate of development of the society is decreased which affects the society but saving the society is more important than development. Taking risk with proper preparation is very important. We get a ample amount of time to develop the society but the preparation should me managed fairly.<br />If i am developing this game and get a chance to change one thing, i would provide a bar in which we can invest some money in the education and security of the society. The reason behind adding this is, a society should definitely invest on preparation for natural calamity but at the same time it should invest money in controlling the crime rate and education level of the society as the education level will directly reflect the development of the people of the society and controlling crime and providing security to the society will insure perfect working of the system without any disturbance to any one.</div>
