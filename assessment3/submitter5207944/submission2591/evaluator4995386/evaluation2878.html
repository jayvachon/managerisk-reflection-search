    <div class="field-value">Congrats Mr. Seun Adeola,

His reflection was well aligned with the objectives of the course on risk management. 

The balance between the development of PODs, economic developments and research on the possible impacts of comets really was a good parameter for evolution. 

After the "tragedies", showed the damage is hard to be retrieved, even with cash in hand. From the hiring of insurance, it was easier to recover PODs. 
With insurance it became clear that the investment was small compared to the desired coverage and the level of recovery (energy level) was much faster. 

Congratulations .. to follow this course in their tasks. 

We meet at the course forum.

Best Regards.

Marcos J. Ribeiro
