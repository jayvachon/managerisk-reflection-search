    <div class="field-value">He/She showed a relatively good understanding of the importance of risk management. Moreover, I liked the amendments he recommended for the game in terms of reality and location. However, he didn't focus enough on the three factors of the preparation for risk- Knowledge, Protection, and Insurance- rather he focused more on the given resources, Money and time. So I think he should have described a little bit more about the trade-offs he had to make between the three preparation factors in order to win the game. 
In conclusion, I consider his reflection rather good and creative at some points. </div>
