    <div class="field-value"><div>On this brief report i try to write my first reflections on the Risk Horizon game specified as follows:</div><div><br /></div><div>The role of the risk manager is to perform evaluations and to adopt measures of prevention and protection.</div><div><br /></div><div>In the conduct of the game in terms of knowledge, protection and insurance is done through choices such as: <br />knowledge: it involves having assessed all the risk factors that characterize the community; <br />protection: it implies the possibility to adopt in a timely manner appropriate protective measures against natural disasters; <br />Insurance is a financial instrument with which you buy coverage at various levels.</div><div><br /></div><div><span>Risk preparedness influences the development with immediate effect and with effects in the medium and long-term influence over time the type of community, its infrastructural facilities and the behavioral habits of the people <span>who lives there.</span></span></div><div><span><span><br /></span></span></div><div>The game teaches in a manner similar to real life the development of a community is influenced by various factors that need to be properly planned and discussed: </div><div>the community needs to develop; </div><div>during the development stages you have problems of various kinds; </div><div>problems are characterized by risk factors and measures to be taken are: </div><div> How, where, and when to develop; </div><div> How, where, and when to protect your territory; </div><div> As with any insurance to cover the risks; </div><div> How to be timely interventions during the phases of emergency.</div><div><br /></div><div>The first game is definitely the most difficult because you do not know the effects of the game. Below you will learn quickly even though it is very difficult to achieve a good level and to maintain it for the future.</div><div>Experience teaches a lot both in life and in the game. </div><div>In this scenario where community development is necessary and inevitable natural events are the most important thing seems to be the protection of the territory, and secondly assessing the level of insurance coverage. It is very important to be timely emergency response and repair of damaged assets. </div><div>To improve the representation of the game would introduce the possibility of intervening with the technological evolution of the infrastructures and in the and the predictive power of natural hazardous events.</div><div>The communities are increasingly complex systems where many factors contribute to the evaluation. The communities are able to react to external factors according to their level of knowledge and to their capacity optimization. Knowledge and optimization may be additional elements of development for the game.</div><div><br /></div><div></div></div>
