    <h1>Submission 2600 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7526976, session_user_id: cd4a336f9e851dfa6248d4a4f60184ffc64e06f9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1)The game has an inbuilt system wherein one can find the
chances if a comet is going to hit or not and what would be the severity of the
hit. This gives the user a change to manage the risk. The user can conduct a
research every time since the comet shows on the horizon. </p>

<p>The list on the comet gives the player an idea about the
severity of hit and chances of the comet hitting. This gives the player a
chance to build a strategy in terms of research and protection . A comet having
no chance of a hit can be avoided and the resources can be directed to the
building of pods.</p>

<p>2)I played the game several times. In the first go I could
not save the pods, hence I just enumerated the mistakes I made in that turn. In
the subsequent turns,</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I researched the comet as and when it appeared
on the horizon. This gave me chance to protect my pods after the comet had hit.
In the first turn, I concentrated on building the pods majorly. This kept the
ticker green but a hit is all it takes. So in order to have some protection
time after the hit, I used the research ticker in the game. Hence in the turns I
took at the game, I learnt to hedge the risk by knowing the details and chances
of a comet’s hit</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I bought insurance just well in advance so that
at end if I don’t have enough resources to buy insurance I should get into any
kind of trouble. Insurance reduces the anticipatory damages that are caused by
these comets. An insurance helped me a lot in subsequent turns I took. It
reduced amount of resources needed for the rebuilding of pods. This helped me
in keeping the ticker green.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>To hedge the risk I protected my  pods by raising the level of the land.</p></div>
