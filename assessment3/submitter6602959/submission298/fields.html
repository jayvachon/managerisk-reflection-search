    <h1>Submission 298 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6602959, session_user_id: ca36a9ea9b2de36ac3bc4f416f67a88f843752e9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game turned out to be harder than the interface looks. I
have tried a total of 3 times, with the first 2 attempts failing at level 2.</p>

<p>Initially, I thought that the balance between knowledge,
protection and insurance will be easy to achieve. I was wrong: During the first
attempt I focused on insurance and protection, thinking that it will
effectively fend off comet strikes and minimize potential losses. This way, I believed
that a solid protection will lay the foundation for rapid development. However,
the game was designed such that I could not accumulate knowledge fast enough at
later levels. Though I used ample risk preparation, the effects were not
immediate.</p>

<p>In my second attempt I focused more on gaining knowledge,
using almost all the money to build infrastructure while preparing less and
buys no insurance. It worked for level 1 and my growth almost exceeded the bar.
However, when a huge comet strike I lost most of my infrastructure.</p>

<p>After the failure of the two previous attempts I have learnt
that protection and insurance is indispensable, but at earlier levels it is
more advisable to build up the base for rapid knowledge expansion, which is
what I did in my last attempt. I managed to get to level 4 this time.</p>

<p>In a newer version, I would like to suggest providing more
building types, players can now research in scientific buildings that provide
rapid knowledge development but takes very long to build. Additionally, if it
suffered damage from comets during construction, building progress will be
lose. This is to introduce a high reward but high risk component to the game. These
changes aptly represented how the forefathers of Singapore (where I live) took
on much risk to develop its high tech industry that would later provide value-added
service to the world. Those decisions has shaped Singapore into a world-class
exporter of value-added products and transformed the economy into one of the
most advanced in the region.</p><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
