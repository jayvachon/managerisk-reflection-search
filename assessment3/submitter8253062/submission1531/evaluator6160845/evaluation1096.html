    <div class="field-value">The reflection described the conditions of the game in a very systematic manner.  The inclusion of the knowledge gained from the different conditions (availability of resources, capacity for growth, threat from comets) was described through the strategy and action during the game.  The game provided the writer with the chance to explore the validity of the knowledge learned about risk management.  In playing the game, the writer showed the learning of how risk management, if utilized properly, can be a relevant tool for development .
The key strength of the reflection was the clarity of the presentation.  The process of learning was described in a manner that is easily understood.
The refection showed excellent clarity, comprehension and reflection on the game and how it related to the knowledge and learning for the week.  It will be interesting to see how these can be reflected on actual or real-life conditions within the writer's environment (community- or country-level). </div>
