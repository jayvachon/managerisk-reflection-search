    <div class="field-value">There two parts I appreciate most:
1. The student has presented how he/she improve the outcome by balancing the risk management and the development. The student tried different approaches to play the game and valued the different results.
2. When talking about the improvement plan of the game itself, the player promoted an idea of 'policy/economic issues as possible crisis'. The money growth is set to be stable in the game which differs from reality.
One thing can be improved is that the student should demonstrate which level he/she has reached to provide a better understanding for me that how much a difference his/her perception of the game makes.</div>
