    <div class="field-value">I liked very much this reflection: "The game clearly shows that if there is no preparation for dealing with risk,  by  protection or insurance, either immediately or after some time the development is affected due to the destruction of that built or the lack of resources to build in time adequately."

I could not have described it better. The balance between protection and development must be given through appropriate risk management and resource availability.
