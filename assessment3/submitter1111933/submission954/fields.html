    <h1>Submission 954 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1111933, session_user_id: 76cdbc036fd7967542f35e18cc7a7bfb7df02e27)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">the role of risk management in the game is to balance between development goals Â and threats that threaten your development by gaining information, protection and putting insurance for worse case scenario. I choosed to research certain comets over another when they are more powerful and more likely to hit.each tool you have has its benefits and drawbacks and you need to balance which one to use according to cash exist, your development meter and the position of the comit. preparation in terms of protection, research, community assistance and level of development are key for risk affect development.<br /><br />playing more than one time teach you to learn how to balance and get use of all the tools you have. at first i didnt do much protection and depended on research, community and insurance. but with trials i understood the role of protection in the short and long run. I learnt the importance of research, protection, community assistance in facing natural disasters and that the more you are prepared the more you can overcome it with the least "damages". I also knew the importance of our Ozone layer :)<br /><br />If i would add one thing, it will be that when one lose for not catching up the development meter in for ex. level 5 he dont need to start building the town all over again from level 1. all what he need is to repeat the level (5) with exact resources he started with</div>
