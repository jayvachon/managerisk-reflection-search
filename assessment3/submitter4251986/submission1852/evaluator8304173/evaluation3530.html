    <div class="field-value">You did a good job explaining some of your questions and how that may be accurate in real life. For the research piece, I would like to point out that it takes money and time. The level of research increased as you stared that heavenly object approaching the Earth. You would learn the likelihood of destruction and hit as time passed. However, if you spent a lot of time researching, you would not develop your city; this is a trade off for risk management and development. You had the choice to do the research, mitigate, and develop. This decision should be based upon the information you had. Unprecedented development would not leave you with a lot of resources to mitigate or cope with hits, I think this piece of information would increment your answer on this questions. </div>
