    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>1.      I had a difficult time balancing risk managment and development.  For example, I found it difficult to develop enough cash to buy the insurance I needed when I saw a comet coming.  I noticed that the insurance I needed was often a very few dollars more than I had.  I tried waiting to purchase the insurance, but the money count did not add upwards as I waited.  I also found it difficult to raise the land, which is the solution for long-term safety.  I did notice that repairs were quick and inexpensive after buying insurance.  If I could see the whole screen again, I would be very slow to raise the island in the early stages.  Trying to raise the island early in the game cost a lot of money and seemed to turn the left bar red.  I would also spend more time researching the comets.  Additionally, I would save more money for insurance when the most severe comets with the higher levels of certainty to impact were coming.  In summary, it was hard to balance development with knowledge, protection and insurance.  Protection came from raising the island level and also researching the comets enough to have time for community action after the impacts.  The knowledge gained from researching the comet helped decrease the damage and the insurance protection made the damage decrease or at least it made rebuilding after damage less expensive and more rapid.</b></p><p><b>2.  I played the game many, many times.  I played at least 20 times.  I found that it was important to do all the elements simultaneously.  It was important to use the research, insurance, and raising the level while also trying to develop enough to have sufficient cash to afford the protection efforts.</b></p><p><b>3.  I had a lot of technical trouble seeing the game.  I experienced a ton of difficulty seeing the top and bottom of the screen.  Many times this made it impossible to see the comets until they were almost landing and I could not see the cash balance or the insurance information.  In all, the technical difficulty made the "game" extremely frustrating.  I suggest adding some diagnostics to see if the student's computer has the appropriate resolution and sizing while loading the game.   I also suspect that the best thing for long-term development, raising the island, was too expensive early in the game.  Raising the island (protection) made the bar on the left side drop from a high level of green to a low level and red.  Also, there were many times when the insurance would not respond to my selection.  This took valauble time and prevented other efforts while trying to purchase insurance.</b></p><p><strong>If I would suggest one simple change, it would be to give the price of raising the island more clearly.  I could not find out the cost of raising the island by a bar or half a bar, etc.  That would have made the choice of when to attempt raising the island more clear.   I would often try to raise the island in the last seconds before impact because it was the only action I could take quickly.  Then it would change the cash balance.  It seemed like the income and the expenses would change quickly, but I could not figure why the income was increasing and decreasing quickly in the last moments.</strong></p><p><strong></strong> </p><p><strong></strong> </p><b></b><p><b><br /></b><br /></p><p></p><p><b><br /></b></p></div>
