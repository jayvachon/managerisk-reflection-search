    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>This is really an exciting game, I tried it at least 10
times, my best record was level 5 but sometimes I just reached level 2. I think
I got such different results because of different portfolios of knowledge,
protection and insurance.</p>

<p>In the game, the function of risk management is to minimize
the loss when disasters come (the comet hits).  As the fund is limited and I must hold certain
speed of construction to pass the level, so that I cannot use all the money to
build plots or just pay attention to buy the highest level of insurance.</p>

<p>I used the entire fund to build the plots, and then realized
I didn’t have enough money to buy insurance or get the protection ready for attacking.
When the first comet came, I could only buy the cheapest insurance or just get 10%
protection, so I chose to buy the insurance. However, it led me to 30% damage
and lost a lot of money. When I finally past the level 1 and entered level 2, I
improved the protection to 40% before I upgraded the plots. I also realized
that I should check the detail information before I determined what to do to
prepare for the potential hit. So I checked the detail information about the
coming comet and bought the second level insurance. I past level 2 quite smoothly,
however, I failed in the level 3 because I didn’t get enough wealth. Then I
recognized that I must improve the construction speed to get enough score.</p>

<p>I did a very bad job for the second time, there were 6
comets came at the first level and four of the six hit the planet, I relied on
the insurance to get refund when I suffered damage, but it didn’t work as good
as I expected.</p>

<p>In the following two times, I found out that promoting the
protection level before hitting and improving network connections with plots after
hitting reduce more risk and saving more money than just buying high level insurance.
I even tried a risk managing portfolio that just keep on observing the comet
and improve the protection level to 70% or even 80% without any insurance. It
worked well actually, I got rid of most of the damage with the high level of
protection and the network connections after hitting even for some highly
severe hits and reached level 5 at last.</p>

<p>From this game, I learned some useful information to deal
with risk. The first is you need to maximize the utility of your limited
resources. The second is you need to research as much as you could for the risk
which could help you make better decisions. The third is that risk management will
not work immediately; all the methods you use to avoid or reduce risk should be
done ahead of schedule. The fourth is that there’s no particular way to do risk
management, you should try different portfolios to find out the most suitable
one.</p>

<p>I really think this is a perfect game, it challenged me a
lot. However, if I have to change one thing in the game, I’ll add the loan
function. In the reality, poor countries usually get loans from the World Bank
or other institutions to build their own infrastructures to improve their ability
to deal with risks. So I think it's a good method when there’s not enough money
to build or upgrade new plots or if there’s not enough money to buy insurance,
or not enough money to improve protection, players could get loan to do so. </p></div>
