    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection: The knowledge is the most important thing of the time spend in the game "Risk Horizont"
The key strength of the reflection: In my opinion, the knowledge is the most important thing of the time spend in the game "Risk Horizont"
I learned three things from the game. Firstly risk management when variety of preparation and coping mechanisms need to be put into place to ensure the most effective risk management. Secondly, balancing a broad range of risk management strategies is vital to preventing and mitigating risk. Thirdly, the combination of knowledge, protection and insurance must be applied in combination in order to implement an integrated risk management approach. 
I think that you can incluide in your refleccion the next: Something we thing that one person with a lot experience could have more knowledge than one person who is almost finished his career however only the experience is not enough to warrant the successful.
The only way to get the learning is:
1. The Knowledge
2. Reflection about the thing that happened
3. Define theories
4. Apply the conclusions
