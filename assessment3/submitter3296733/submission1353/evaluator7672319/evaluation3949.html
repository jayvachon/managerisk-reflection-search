    <div class="field-value">I think you explained very well the progress and the changes you had to make in order to win the game, which in turn shows that you have understood the risk management process as shown in our course. One thing that perhaps needed a bit more reflection was the answer to the last question, on how to improve the game in the future. I didn't quite understand what you meant by suggesting a different status indicator. Overall, I think your reflection was very comprehensive and it looks like it really helped you understand the importance of balancing different aspects of risk management. Well done!</div>
