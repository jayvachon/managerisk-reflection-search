    <div class="field-value">This reflection's key strength is drawing the principles of the game into a real life example of evaluating risk. This shows critical thinking. The reflection would have been improved by incorporating some comments on the opportunities inherent in risk management. The writer also stated that it was too late to buy insurance when the comet had already appeared, whereas insurance could be bought right up to the moment of impact.</div>
