    <h1>Submission 1800 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8293815, session_user_id: 3fa5e6d1cbbc51dfa830d3bbd210cf9ebebe31fc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p><p> </p><p>In the game the role of risk management is defined as
preparing before shocks and coping afterwards. This is underpinned by
knowledge, protection, and insurance. In my first few attempts I made a strategic
choice to build the community but at the same time did not compromise on
building knowledge of the comets.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>However it was over the next set of attempts that I began to
build Alora with the combined use of the above mentioned tools.  By clicking on the comet I built up my
research bank, which helped me put up protection measure. This enhanced the
outcomes e.g. minimise damage to Alora and help it flourish. However as this
protection was not a total guarantee I began to incorporate insurance to help cushion
the blow from adverse shocks.  </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>So at stage two and three I began to understand how to look
for the severity of the comet and the chances of it hitting my pods. To
minimise the chance of a hit I ensured that my protection bar was fully aligned
with the severity of the comet. However sometimes it was too late to buy
insurance as the comet had already appeared and in other cases when insurance
cover was available I did not have enough resources.  </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Whilst in literature terms and understanding I was full ware
of the need to proactively deploy all the elements of effective risk
management, on the game it took me a while to find the right combination and
reach level five. After a few hours of continuous playing I decided to approach
from risk mitigating perspective which most insurance companies deploy when
insuring against natural disasters. With this in mind I made one final attempt
with a revised strategy, raise Alora high enough to mitigate effect of comets
strike, develop pods evenly over a period of time and take out both sufficient
insurance and research when the risk of being hit by a comet was high and Alora
was not appropriately raised.</p>

<p>So on reflection the game is very intuitive and a must tool
to help understand how it can use be used in everyday lives/situations. It
shows many concepts about finding the right balance/strategies to help make
effective and tough decisions under budget, time and natural disaster environment.
To put this into my perspective I did a cost benefit analysis when I was faced
with underpinning my house as a result of subsidence or move all together to a
subsidence free area. By moving I would pay cheaper insurance premium but face
future potential risk of subsidence including impact and shock in an area
densely populated with evergreen trees and known for heavy subsidence. This
would financially impact me more than rectifying my existing house as per
insurance instructions/research and thereby keeping the insurance premium down
to a minimum. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>In this context the one change I would introduce to the game
would the probability of subsidence occurring and the levels of it ranging on a
scale of 1 to 10  with 10 being the
greatest and quickest for subsidence to occur. With this information people in
my area would be able to make appropriate risk management choices within the
overall risk chain.</span></p><span>
