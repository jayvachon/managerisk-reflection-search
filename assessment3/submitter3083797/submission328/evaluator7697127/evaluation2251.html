    <div class="field-value">the key strength of this reflection was that it clearly articulated the experience and it was to the point. the student has understood what needed to be done in order to win the game i.e. saving the community.

one thing that would make the reflection better would be the manner of presentment. everything has been written in paragraphs. depicting information using bullets or numbering would have improved the presentment. overall, the student has done a great job.</div>
