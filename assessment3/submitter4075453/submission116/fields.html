    <h1>Submission 116 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4075453, session_user_id: 66b827cddf5a391c3b0f76b45cb4cb8f3e077aa6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) Risk management<span> is the identification, assessment, and prioritisation of<u> risks</u></span><span><span> <span>(defined in </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31000" title="Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_31000">I</a><u>SO 31000</u><span> as <i>the
effect of uncertainty on objectives</i>)
followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize,
monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events or
to maximize the realization of opportunities. Risks can come from uncertainty
in financial markets, threats from project failures (at any phase in design,
development, production, or sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit
risk, accidents, <u>natural causes and disasters </u></span><span>as
well as deliberate attack from an adversary, or events of uncertain or
unpredictable <u>root -cause</u></span></span></p>

<p>The strategies to
manage threats (uncertainties with negative consequences) typically include
transferring the threat to another party, avoiding the threat, reducing the
negative effect or probability of the threat, or even accepting some or all of
the potential or actual consequences of a particular threat, and the opposites
for opportunities (uncertain future states with benefits).</p>

<p>The task was to develop community to the best of the ability while
meeting certain milestones along the way. These milestones were indicated by
lines marked on the development bar. We were to fill your development bar by
building and upgrading pods. Each pod was to help increase your rate of
development.</p>

<p>Alora falls victim to falling comets( shocks). These comets careen into
the water and cause waves that hinder development. Idea was to balance between
growing community and preparing for these potential shocks by balancing Research,
Protection, and Insurance. And each action costs precious resources!</p>

<p>The power of the Research is to look out into
space and learn the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the
severity of the comet. By clicking on a comet and keeping it's box focused on
screen, one could accumulate research. With each filled in notch, one can receive
more time to create community connections right before the comet hits, helping to
boost the protection. </p>

<p>The long term protection is against the waves.
One can press and hold the slider, located on the bottom right of the screen,
into the upright position to raise the island. By matching the level of
protection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider, with the
severity of the comet, we can prevent the pods from being damaged! But the more
one lifts, the more this power costs. </p>

<p>By obtaining insurance, the pods damaged from flooding are quicker and
cheaper to rebuild. Insurance also recovers lost development time after pods
are repaired.</p>

<p>By using these three powers of Research,
Protection and Insurance in concert with development, we can create a healthy
community and create a Luminator legacy! The only way to succeed is to find the
perfect balance and to keep eyes on the horizon. </p><p>2 )  I played the game more than once and every time I played it I got more hang of the game and also could garner sufficient information on how to effectively and efficiently balance  the power of research, protection and insurance for optimum development of the community. The balancing act has to be optimally done to ensure proper development in the minimum insurance and with the best research  to have best possible protection.</p><p>3)  I live in Mumbai and the most important change I would like to see is the implementation of the knowledge or information available.There is no dearth of educated workforce or the availability of Risk management knowledge .There is lack of will to implement and this might be due to lack of resources or corruption or the feeling that the disaster wont hit us twice . Hence I would like to add the mandatory insurance and knowledge of risk management apart from implementation of the same in given time frame in the game.</p>
