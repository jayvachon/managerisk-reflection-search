    <h1>Submission 1855 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8103157, session_user_id: 1a7a158cf18f15a092b659d3ba0cec589c255dcf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>GAME REFLECTION </p>

<p>Risk management played a huge role in the game, it helped me
to plan/research then insure n provide some protection as well as coping with
the shocks. The research helped me to know the impending risk and how to best to
handle them. Insurance reduced the amount of money I had to use to repair the
shocks once they occur. Protection helped prevent the shocks from occurring. However
no matter how I distributed the money between doing the necessary research,
buying insurance, putting in some sort protection I had to leave a some money
for repairing the community once the shocks occur because if not enough money
is left for repairing, itâ€™s going to take a much longer period of time to
repair the community. Therefore balancing all these four was a necessity;
though it was not easy as one cannot 100% predict the future however
preparation made it easier to cope with the shocks.</p>

<p>I played the game a couple of times and each time I played I
tried to do something different. I changed the insurance policies, the
protection I had as well as the research done. The money left for coping
differed as well, its monitoring was low the first games and increased with
time as I was left with little money to repair one or two ports which hampered
my developments after the shock. I increased my research with time as well as I
realized it reduced the impact as well as give me more time to get the bonus
time. I learned that it is vital to find the right balance between these four. There
is no need to do a lot of research and from that research you do not take
action as suggested. For example if the research shows a high level of occurrence
and high level of damage it is important to take some insurance and have some
money left to repair. Taking some sort of protection will also go a long way in
the future.</p>

<p>Should I be tasked with changing something about the game I would
make the calculations more clear and stated. For example if a shock occurs it
should indicate how much the damage it has caused and from that damage how much
was covered by the insurance, how protection reduced the damage and how
research helped. All these stated in monetary terms because I think it will
make it more vivid. I live in a semi desert country so we are most likely to
have droughts as compared to floods.</p>
