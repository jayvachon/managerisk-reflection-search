    <div class="field-value">Strength: Reflection shows concept clarity and how to know, prerpare and cope with a risk. What and how our startegy should be if have to prepare for a risk. It shows student has taken a lesson out of the course and has applied in the game.
One thing that would make this reflection better: While answering 2nd question student undermined inmportance of insurance. As protection can't rule out the importance of insurance. Yes, protection can bring down the damage caused or insurance cost but can never rule out the importance of insurance. As in this game, one could not completely protect the colonies, so insurance was necessary to bring redevelopment cost and time to redevelop colonies. So, Insurance is as neccessary as protection. None can replace other.
