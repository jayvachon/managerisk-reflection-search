    <h1>Submission 1306 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3538823, session_user_id: 23c4a50011365bbbe7e7899d2942cf76c36adbc2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">At first glance, it is very easy game with simple interface. But as long as you try to reach higher level, you understand how is it difficult to balance between development and preserve actions to go further. I have reached level 5 due to my early invest in pods and failed due to lag, when the pods was destroyed. If we draw an analogy with the real life, it is actually very good example how the company is operating, and in a view of finance, how the absence of insurance can destroy your cash. <br />the main things which i have understand are:<br />- whenever you do business (project) should be always prepared for shocking situations.<br />- have a reserve<br />- slower safe development is much better than fast and uninsured<br />- the more you explore the risk, the easier it would be to eliminate the consequences.<br />- insurance in high risk industries are the key safety providers.<br />If I would be responsible of creating the new version of the game, i might be added few snapshots of analogies or examples from real life, <br /><br /></div>
