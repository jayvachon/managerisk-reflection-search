    <div class="field-value">This reflection covers all aspects that were provided in the frame work for writing the essay.The student had a clear understanding of the game and what all was expected to be written in the essay. The student however has focused a little more on the choice between protection and insurance and in a way neglects the development aspect.The recommendations given by the students are good and worth considering.</div>
