    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection was that the author was able to relate components of the game with real world examples in India. I liked how the author used the incidences of flooding and the outbreak of malaria to demostrate the negative effects of shocks in the pursuit of new opportunity.

I would have liked to understand better how did the author juggle between the challenge of meeting the development goals and building up a risk management system to protect the pods.</div>
