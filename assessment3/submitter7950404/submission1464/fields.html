    <h1>Submission 1464 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7950404, session_user_id: 41f11d2db76719e05a447eef26070cc702063832)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Managing risk in the game served the same purpose as in life itself: to prevent standards of living from being set back. In India, with every failed monsoon and the consequent food inflation, families especially in the rural sector have had to reallocate resources at the cost of the pursuit of opportunity. For example, the savings earmarked for repairs to the drainage system would be sunk in buying pricier food. The resulting malaria outbreak, thanks to leaking sewers, would eat their savings further, sending the poor rural family into a self-feeding cycle of disease and despair. </div><div><br /></div><div>The game painted much the same picture: with every wave of destruction sent by the meteor came the need to repair the houses, the money spent on which could have originally been spent on the protection or insurance. Conversely, managing risk by balanced spending on knowledge and preparation, reduced the costs involved in building the house back to the phase of development it had attained previously.</div><div><br /></div><div>I had to play the game thrice to achieve Level 4. On all three attempts, however, I reached Level 2. In my first two attempts, I had spent enough on insurance and protection but had not spent time on research. The pods in the game took a hit from the meteors as a result, often with damage requiring significant costs on repairs. What was different in the final attempt was that I spent more time on the research. </div><div><br /></div><div>I found a lesson to draw here: the right balance of costs spent on preparation and coping can only be achieved with a sound understanding of the situation at hand, through research. </div><div><br /></div><div>If I were to change an aspect of the game, it would be to improve the interaction between pods in the aftermath of a meteor hit. How societies interact and assist one another goes a long way in mitigating disaster or coping with one. </div></div>
