    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the author clearly understood the intended lessons which were meant to be learned from the game. 
It got a little confusing to figure out which questions from the reflection exercise were being addressed, possibly better development of the reflection was needed. This could also be attributed to the fact that the author was not a native English speaker. </div>
