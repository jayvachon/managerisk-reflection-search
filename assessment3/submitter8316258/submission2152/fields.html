    <h1>Submission 2152 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8316258, session_user_id: d6b09713be182efca6ef231a8a159d22a0a02c07)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This
game was very educative as it imparts the importance to achieve risks in the
most efficient way. It was very challenging in all its aspects. The game includes
the concept of risk management in all the levels, thereby giving me a final
exposure of different stages of risks and their after-effects. An approach game
that inculcates within itself the challenges that could be symbolically related
to the instances in our daily life. Being the Luminator of Alora, the task
given was to develop the community by foreseeing risks and to make sure that
there is advancement in the society. It was an identical thought-provoking game
as it enables us to take decisions and take the right quantity of risks by
researching on them. By structure pods, the rate of development would increase
and thereby making the environment much safer.</p>

<p>It
was important to note that there should be a sense of balance throughout as we
had to check for few parameters before we could develop and safeguard the land.
This aspect taught me the implication of responsibility that we possess in our
lives to income care of the environment we live in and also to take large quantity
of risks on an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the public to bear
the shocks but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It is indeed
really important to research on the risks that come our way and eventually cultivate
on a protection plan to minimize the damages from it. Assurance is also a key
element in the game, as it ensures and safeguards the land from major damage.
It will be inexpensive and quicker to rebuild the pods after damage. Outstanding
a balance between them all and performing each action with utmost care was
indeed a very challenging task. </p>

<p>While
playing the game, it was also important to do proper time management as we had
a time constraint in developing the land of Alora and also to protect them from
the waves caused by the meteors. So within the stipulated time, good research,
protection, development and insurance against the damages were to be done in
the best possible way. Good research was mandatory as it educated us with the
performance and the severity of the meteors and how it could affect the
environment. Groundwork of risks also helped in money management. Building the
right number of pods with the given budget and also to insure them was a
decision that we had to take after much observation and thought. </p>

<p>While
playing the game for the first time, I had incomplete myself to only 25%
insurance, but as I moved on, it was significant to take bigger risks and hence
had to increase the insurance to 75%. Though building pods was important to
develop the land, insuring them against meteor waves was equally important.
Thereby, it was important for me to strike a sense of equilibrium between time,
money and the resources at all points during the game. </p>

<p><span>If
I were to develop a new version of the game, I would have made it comparatively
more realistic by presenting real life situations of defensive a city or
environment and have obstacles and risks in relative to the real-life situations.
I would have also introduced few other concepts in which the players could make
some money as they deal with compensations. </span></p></div>
