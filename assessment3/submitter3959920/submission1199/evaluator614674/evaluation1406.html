    <div class="field-value">The reflection very beautifully connects the aspect of protection in the game to real life example of earthquakes in Japan. However it could have also emphasised a little more on knowledge and insurance. Would have been great if the writer could have talked about the research done on the meteors and how community connections were helpful by acting as an insurance and how these could be useful even at times when the protection wasn't at par with the severity of meteor. A great understanding about protection, though. Great attempt!</div>
