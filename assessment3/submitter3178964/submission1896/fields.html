    <h1>Submission 1896 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3178964, session_user_id: 8ef8cef476e447346e708167bffad316802d0e2e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I think the role of risk management in the game was underlined by insurance and knowledge practices. As a player, I was supposed to get prepared for disasters caused by meteors by increasing my knowledge about them. I noticed that meteors caused lower damages in cases where I made adequate researches. Because their severity level was reducing in that cases. However, I could not do anything to reduce severity as the chances of hit was so high that there was nothing I could do by increasing my knowledge. In that cases, the more appropriate instrument was insurance which help me recover my damages quickly. Another point I liked about the game was the chance and resource factors that were embedded to the game quite successfully. My money was saving by time and I had to make good choices to use my resources effectively and appropriately.   <br /></div>
