    <div class="field-value">In my opinion,the key strenght of this reflection is the way the author analyzed the game through the process of making mistakes and learning from them and explaining how the concepts discussed in the course helped him understand and do better. Also, I like the fact that he gave an example from his country and an example discussed in the lectures. However, I think the explanation with the example should have been a bit clearer because it is hard at least for me to distinguish which advice is related to the game and which for Indonesia. However, overall in my opinion, the reflection shows understanding of the course concepts and the purpose of the game as related to it is very well described!</div>
