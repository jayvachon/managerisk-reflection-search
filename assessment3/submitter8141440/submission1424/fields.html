    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management played an very fundamental role in this game. On the one hand it was important to gather the information about the comets and on the other hand to level up the plots to protect them from damage once they are hit by a comet. Furthermore it was also important to take the appropriate amount of insurance. There was a trade-off between research and protection. I always tried to reach the necessary amount of protection to avoid damage. If you did a lot for risk preparatio , the development lacked behind after some time. But if you spend a lot time and money on risk preparation, the damage is less in comparison to no risk preparation. <br />I played the game twice and tried to find out more about the comets and spend more time on research. The main things I learned from the game are that you have to take many different things into account when you want to do an robust risk management. You have to be flexible and it is not a good decision to stick to old plans when the circumstances are changing. With a changing environment and changing conditions you may have to adjust your plans and underlying assumptions. It is always important to look into the future to prevent or to lower shocks. Nonetheless one should not forget about the past event, because it is a good opportunity to learn something to prevent future events. <br />I live in Germany. One could say that i live in a relatively safe country with not a lot if risks. With respect to the European Union we are dependent from other countries. Therefore I would suggest to have another planet which represents our partner countries. Our damage should be in some way independent from our damage. Furthermore we should have the opportunity to help them or not. This should in turn influence our damage or even more our chance to recover from the event. <br /></div>
