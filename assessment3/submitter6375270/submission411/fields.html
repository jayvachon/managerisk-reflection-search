    <h1>Submission 411 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6375270, session_user_id: eb7990435c70daf99839a53ec29aeaead92771bd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Qn 1.</b><br />I found that investment in<b> protection</b> early on in the game was:<br /><ol><li>cheap and</li><li>able to be carried over from level to level. </li></ol><b>Insurance</b> became progressively more expensive as the game progressed - it could not be shared between levels and was often wasted. This was experienced at a more microlevel as the choice of creating <b>knowledge </b>(between two equally catastrophic meteors) could often be wasted if the meteor “missed”.<br /><br />By combining all three and setting a risk management profile at the beginning, I was able to determine which shocks I would accept, which ones I would mitigate (with knowledge, protection and or insurance) and which shocks I would actively prevent. This profile would serve as a risk management plan, allowing me to make swift choices and focus on development.<br /><br />My solution was to maximise protection and development early, invest in knowledge for meteors that were beyond my protection (those that were less, I would allow to hit) and taking 50% insurance if the hit would be more than two bars and more than half way through the level.<br /><br /><b>Qn 2.<br /></b>With each subsequent attempt, I made a conscious effort to quarantine each risk mitigation strategy (insurance, research, lifting the platform, time management, staggering development until the meteors had passed) to determine the optimum level of each.<br /><br />
With this I discovered that each mitigation had different levels of effectiveness as the severity and “cost” on each level differed. Thus, a matrix quarantine resulting in almost 20 different combinations of strategies for each level, I chose to proceed with the understanding that a balanced approach to protection at each level and development was required.<br /><br />
I learnt that a sustained approach to development forces the player to make difficult choices because the more development you have, the more you have to lose. In early levels you can afford a few mistakes and slower rate of development because the opportunity cost of inaction is low.<br /><br /><b>Qn 3.<br /></b>While the theme of the game " global annihilation" is quite compelling; it fails to address the stakeholder management paradigm throughout different stages of the same project/outcome being of different importance to each stakeholder -- even whilst all working towards a common goal.<br /><br />Where I live (West Africa), time is cheap. I would have liked to better manage time as a resource by allocating a negative externality to inaction. We often find that the local communities and institutions prefer inaction and complacency to any form of leadership or action. They lack the problem solving skills to fix their own problems so they wait for external forces to intervene. This has partly been driven by a culture of aid and charity over the past 50-60 years.<br /><br />
Inaction (or waiting it out) forces the strongest player to show their hand or fix a shock. Typically, this is local business because they have the most to lose (capital is cheap and time is not). Despite repeated attempts at encouraging the community and providing them with the resources to take ownership of their own lands and problems they are more capable of “waiting out” a problem than a larger enterprise/institution. This contributes to the ongoing cycle of poverty.<br /><br />
Businesses have become defacto mothers. It has become not only an expectation that they will come and fix the problem but villagers will actively create situations to minimise their risks and force businesses to "support" the villages where aid and charity have failed. A intergenerational culture of lazy and apathetic communities have failed to make the meaningful choices that are required to take ownership of their own lives.<br /></div>
