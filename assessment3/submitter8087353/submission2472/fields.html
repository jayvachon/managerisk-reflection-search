    <h1>Submission 2472 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8087353, session_user_id: c00217e36c6548c9c24cac8f0df03746dd34bb24)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.
Role of risk management:</p>

<p>Managing
resources well by developing pods, connecting community so that during disaster the
recovery could be faster, making sure the comets do not hit etc. Even if the comets hit, the disaster management should
have minimum risks involved by buying the right kind of insurance at each
level. Doing enough research on each type of comet, increasing protection of
the village in accordance to the severity of the comet, upgrading the pods to
increase the growth, preparing for risk affect development were some of the key activities.<br /></p>

<p> 2.
Playing the game more than once made it easier to strategize in accordance to
the difficulty of the game in each level. Colonizing  the village to early
or too late could fail you. Also, connecting the pods is important as it helps in
decreasing the level of disaster. Balancing between managing resources, power n
insurance all in accordance to time is the main key in this game. </p>

<p> 3.
Proposed change in the new version of the game in representing the risk
management choices would be to provide additional resources to reduce the
intensity of the damage, which could be done by providing extra time to prepare
for high severity comet attack for a community which has more number of
upgraded pods (upgraded more than twice). This is because the disaster
management is more difficult for developed community than a developing
community, as more resources n insurance is invested in the former ones, hence
risk management steps involved would be more complex. </p>
