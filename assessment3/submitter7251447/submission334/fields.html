    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. At the Horizon game you can protect your society from the comites. <br />At the part of Knowledge Reserach is a very important part because after the hit yo have the ability to have much time to make the connections between the yellow parts.<br />At the part of protection is the upgrade of the pods.<br />At the part of Insurance as much as you pay the less you need to recover the pod in their begining situation. <br />I prepare for risk with the high insurance and recearch.<br /><br />2. I played the game more than once. At the beggining i focus only to build but i realized that research was a big part because you had the ability after the hit to have more time to make connections between the yelow bublles and the damge sometimes was little in addition with the severity of the hit.<br /><br />3. The thing about the protection against the wavew with the the slider, 
located on the bottom right of the screen, into the upright position to 
raise your island. When I use it it don't really work. I din'nt understand how this mechanism works really. The research is a very important thing to my region where I live because we have problems with flood at the street and upgrade the drainwater system of the area and clean it because this is the main problem of flood at the streets.<br /></div>
