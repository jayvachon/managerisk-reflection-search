    <h1>Submission 1743 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 676173, session_user_id: c8c062915660224046706705f5a0e8515a345640)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>I have different emotions about this game. From one hand this is a great experience. Each attempt shows me that I can't solve development problems, development challenge in standard form. Each new game shows me that I must never use the same tools and same approaches. Every situation is unique and have to be analyzed in appropriate way of development and only then we realize which risk management's tools have to be used.</div><div><br /></div><div>On the other hand, this game is too primitive. Yes, we can understand simple models, but our world much more complex. </div><div><br /></div><div>Natural disasters are shown quite good. We can predict it, we can do a lot of research, but, sometimes we can do nothing with it. It happened and we only can eliminate the effects of.</div><div><br /></div><div>I watch on that as a geographer. Of course, we can manage some features, but we can't manage it  all. We have so many different aspects of developments, risk and opportunity. We can solve some of economic problems and can predict some economic waves, but we can do a little with some of geopolitical challenges because they are more irrational. There is a lot of irrationality when we are using and exploring behavioral patterns.<br />Not only the whole world, but even the state and region is a complex system and we (different types of researchers, government's guys and managers) have to do a lot and perhaps we can create sustainable society.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
