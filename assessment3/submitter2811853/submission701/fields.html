    <h1>Submission 701 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2811853, session_user_id: 62ab24f96ed639d9452bcb32b91080ba0e83e5ad)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management plays an important role in this game, it's the strategy one take. When to build the pods? When to upgrade the pods? How much insurance one should buy? And so on, that all questions. <br />I played the game three times. At the very beginning, i don't know how to play it exactly, I tried, observed the development, through the practice, I found the importance of community connection and the power of insurance, and, of course, the comets monitor. Community connection can help the long term protection and insurance. Connected neighbors and community organizations help one another when a shock comes. By obtaining insurance, pods damaged from flooding will be quicker and cheaper to rebuild, insurance also recovers lost development time after the pods are repaired. By pay attention to the comets, do some research about the severity, the chance to hitting and so on. One receive more time to create community connections right before the comet hits, helping boost the protection. But even you focus on the comet as soon as it appear till its hit the horizon, you will never know what consequence will it occur before its bomb.<br />During the game, one should balance the risk preparation and healthy development, but how? <br />In my opinion, first, community connection is vital, but one can't built the community in hurry because the resource  is limited in one time, and one should take account of the insurance, the pods upgrade, the horizon lift and the time problem. Second, as the higher level comes, the pods developing, the more resource should be paid in insurance because as the pods upgrade, the repair fee is also grown, buy a high level insurance help release the pressure.  <br /> <br /></div>
