    <h1>Submission 1497 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6742272, session_user_id: b0b27a28bce2018a30fe933981c3fb5f53a8c3fb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The course is very much related to the game. One needs to balance research, protection and insurance depending on one's available resources. Preparation indeed arms and secures development against threats and their possible impact. To prepare is the most realistic approach to managing risks. In the game, the player is trained to use his available resources to gain knowledge about the risk through experience and research, launch of specific action for protection, insurance against possible damage and even suggests making connections in minimizing the impact of the damage, even at expediting rehabilitation.<br /><br />I've played the game more than three times in a row. The more I play the game, the more I implement the necessary actions ahead of time. I built three structures immediately and secured a higher yield insurance at once. As soon as I spot a comet I immediately make a research on it for its possible hit and severity of impact.<br /><br />If I am to factor the place I live in into the game, I will include corruption and incompetence of our country leaders. I believe those things should be addressed to. Our experience with typhoon Haiyan for instance showed the incompetence of our leaders and corruption of our government officials from the top to the lowest government workers. That calamity showed the whole world of how much wanting our country is, in terms of readiness to respond quick to calamities. It also showed how politics can be a major obstacle in reaching out for the victims despite the generosity of the international community.Â <br /><br />The severity of super-typhoon Haiyan exposed the symptoms of our country's bankrupt ideology and government system.</div>
