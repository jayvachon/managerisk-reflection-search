    <div class="field-value">I think you explained very well the progress and the changes you had to make in order to get best results in the game and that shows that you understood the risk management process as shown in our course. However some point perhaps needed a bit more clarity, for example the following sentence feels a bit out of place: "Identify the risks connected with an activity e.g. game, locker room, arena parking lot, and travel. "  Overall, I found your reflection to be very insightful and it looks like it helped you learn a lot about the practical applications of the theories and ideas we have been learning. Well done!</div>
