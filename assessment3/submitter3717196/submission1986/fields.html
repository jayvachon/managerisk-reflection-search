    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The role of risk management in the game was that you had to kind of choose between protection or insurance. If you just picked insurance alone, all your developments got damaged after asteroids hit but you would only have to pay a small price fix them. However, If you chose to go for protection only, your developments would be raised and the asteroids would not damage your properties but the problem is that you would not be able to build developments fast enough to win the game. <br /><br />Preparation for risk affected development in that if you focused too much on the asteroid information, you ended up having a more reactionary approach and the problem with that is the asteroids had sometimes had a higher intensity than what the research data was indicating, so you would end up with damaged developments even though you were not expecting them. I was generally thinking the whole time during the game about going for protection as a main reducer of risk but it never worked out for me.<br /><br />2) The first time round I was confused about how to go about things because I did not understand what I need to prioritize as far as the elements of insurance, protection, knowledge and building settlements goes. The second time round I tried to have the settlements all in one small cluster and focused on protection and upgrading the five settlements in order to increase my chances of filling up the life meter. This strategy was not able to get me past level 2. I then chose to build as many settlements as possible and rely mainly on protection, but i still could not get through to level 3. After being utterly frustrated, I went all in with the insurance, but that only worked in level one as in the higher levels, I was not able to rebuild fast enough to fill up the life meter. I would literally fill it up, and then an asteroid hit my settlements with five seconds left on the clock. I finally went for a balanced strategy of insurance and protection and that is what finally got me though to level 3 and after a few more attempts, I was not able to go higher as every time you lost, you went all the way back to level 1.<br /><br />3) I loved the game because it was really challenging, and risk management in the real world is no piece of cake either. It is difficult and folks have to deal with allot of variables in order make a decision about how to help millions of people deal with natural disasters and other issues that may come up. So, in the big picture, I would not change a thing. On a micro scale meaning myself, I would not have people go all the way back to level 1 after failing at higher levels. I would prefer wrestling with the level I just lost, instead of going all the way back down.<br /><br /><br /></div>
