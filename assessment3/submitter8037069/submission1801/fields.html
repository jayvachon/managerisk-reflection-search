    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First off all, congratulations to the creator (or creators) of this
game, besides being a QHSSE Practitioner, I’m also a gamer and had actually played
a lot of similar browser based games, I wouldn't say I’m an expert but I do not
suck either but I could not believe how difficult it is to finish this.<br /><br />
Now to my reflection.</p><p><br /></p><p>Addressing the first questions (right! Questions! With an “S”, because
there are three questions combined in there!) To make it clear, my answers are
marked (1-1), (2-1) and (3-1). Now for the first question of the first set, (1-1):
To my honest opinion the role of Risk Management in the game was sort of like
an decision making scale or balance where in the gamer is put into a situation
where he/she has to decide and prioritize which course of action to do to ensure
growth of his community while at the same time also ensuring security. (2-1): At
first try, I experimented a little bit if I should build up my money but it was
meaningless as without protecting my pods, so next approach I took was to build
pods then immediately acquire protection and insurance, I lost and did not even
reach level 2. Then I let the game run without me doing just research for a
couple of run (just to see what will happen), which really get the green bar
rising and this was my technique until now. (3-1): To me this game teaches
gamers to manage unforeseen risk or events such as natural calamities and disasters,
although in the game it was in a form of comets, in real life it has the same
aspects, you can study it to predict not when it will hit but the potential
damage it can bring and so gives you time to act early and ahead of it and
resulting into either elimination and if not possible then mitigation of the
aftermath.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Addressing the second question, I played the game more than once and
learning from my earlier mistakes, I have learned that the early you prepare
for an unforeseen event really goes a long way.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Addressing the final question, if I were to make version 2, I would
like to see some element of opportunity realization in it. Except for advancing
to the next level, there’s nothing really. And Oh! Some lasers to blast those
pesky comets!</p></div>
