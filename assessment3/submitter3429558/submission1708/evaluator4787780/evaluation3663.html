    <div class="field-value">This reflection had an excellent balance of the individual's game and learning experience. They shared what happened in the game to explain the concepts learned in the course, in a very honest and open manner. Great style.

I think this reflection illustrates the problem with research and people's use of research.  First, research in this game was much cheaper than insurance and flood protection. Same as in the real world. Second, the research knowledge of the game was not understood. The severity of the comet was the valuable information. As long as your flood protection was greater than the severity, no damage was incurred. It is the same problem people have with misunderstanding research knowledge and applying it in the real world.</div>
