    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">the risk management in this game is given to the trade off between insurance, building improved pods and making higher the altitude of the soil to avoide the floods.there were two line to follow, the first was to build more pods and improving them, to reach an high level of connection and knowledge. the second task that the gamer had to follow, was to prevent the hitting, making high the soil and acquiring knowledge about falling comets. futhermore another tool to reduce the losses was buying an insurance, and improving them buying other contracts with more coverage. i would have changed strategy if I had played another time, making new pods, more than three and instead to improve them quickly, create a new village with 6 pods and only after start to improve them. If I had to develop a new version of the game, I wanted to change the enviroment, using a real and not a fiction scenary, so the gamer could experiment a more real feelings in how to manage the risk management. further I had added more threats, such as earthquakes, rains, famine and wars, implementing them in the higher levels, and not repeat the same threats in all the levels added only the speed. so I think that this game as the course are the best exemplification of how a decision maker and generally the population had to manage the risk management, because beyond the quizzes, a real work and a direct taste is very important for a man that had to act to fight against the adversities, and in future had to support the society to prevent several threats. <br /></div>
