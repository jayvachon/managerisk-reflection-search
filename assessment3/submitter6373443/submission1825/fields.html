    <h1>Submission 1825 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6373443, session_user_id: f65e8bb954d4a5f7500ce7b7362e82c2d2d76415)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game illustrates different aspects of risk management. To be successfull, it is necessary to balance development, knowledge, protection, and insurance. I chose to first invest in development on low levels and at the same time, increase protection. When protection was on a good level, I contiunued with improving the existing pods. I did rather focus on protection than on insurance, which came last in my game. When waiting for the pods to be completed/upgraded and comets appeared, I did invest in research. All the time, I tried to keep the protection level higher than the severity level of the threats. This strategy proved to be quite successful overall, though my communities experienced some damage, which was never severe and could be easily fixed.<br /><br />I played the game only once and got straight through to level 5, when the planet was hit by several comets in s short time and I could net finish repair before time ran out. I did stick to the strategy mentioned above, after some playing around in level 1. If I was to play again, I would follow the strategy right from the beginning: first build many low level pods, do research in between, increase protection, and when the budget allows it, buy insurance in between. There might be more effective strategies, but this worked pretty well. It also reflects what I learned from the course this week. Development is the most important because it also generates resources, but the whole community can not be put at risk, so there has to be made adequate effort in protection. The find out what kind of protection is needed at a certain point, it is important to obtain knowledge and to insure the investments that have been already made. It is also important to invest in the future in good times, to have resources in case of a disaster to carry out the rebuilding activities.<br /><br />One thing I would change about the game is the dimension of time. Real life decisions have to be made in a certain time window or window of opportunity. I did not recognize this aspect in the game as it is at the moment.<br /></div>
