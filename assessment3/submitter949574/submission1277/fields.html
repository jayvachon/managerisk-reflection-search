    <h1>Submission 1277 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 949574, session_user_id: e893e8e66bb9d4a21e62edb3b9840b50fc4218c7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of risk management was central to progressing in this game, as the bar on the left side of the screen only reached its mark if the various elements of risk management were balanced in an optimum way. <br />Knowledge, protection and insurance cost money, and each of them had different benefits along with certain disadvantages too.  For example knowledge was essential to predict the possible level of severity, and chances of the comet hitting, at a cost of 5 dollars. This helped in assessing the possible damages so that one could prepare accordingly. Once it was known that a particular comment could cause that much damage by looking at its severity it was necessary to prepare and to protect up to that level, so that the damages in case of a hit are reduced. Protection by preparation came at a cost of development, as the bar on left would stop rising if the preparation button was held constantly for too long. It became clear right away that it was absolutely essential to have at least some kind of insurance, given the fact that comets were a persistent threat. Insurance played a huge role in helping rebuild after a comet had struck, as it brought down the cost of repairs to the pods. <br />Preparation helped immediately in a case where a comet had struck, however it seemed less important when a streak of comets just passed by, but that was a deception as a destructive comet could catch one unawares, and drastically reduce the level and potential for development.<br /><br />2. I played this game for several hours and for a number of times, and I learned that up-gradation of pods was absolutely essential in helping develop faster (the rise of the bar on left), and that the optimum rate was achieved when there were fewer pods to start with and then progressively their levels were simultaneously increased as the levels progressed. So that pods were at the same or higher level than the level of the game. <br />After playing this game for the first time, I quickly learned the importance of insurance. So in the next runs I always made sure right in the start of a level to buy an insurance plan, which could considerably cover the damages, and the level of insurance required to successfully recover from a shock increased as the game level (and the level and number of pods) increased. This was because at a higher stage of development, a shock can cause more damage than at the initial developing stages. <br /><br />3. I'd like to add an additional aspect of state's role in the overall preparedness against a calamity. So far this game has provided the player with this almost authoritarian level of control, which most risk managers don't have in real life, unless they are also some sort of monarch or dictator. Imagine that you have prepared for a few years by creating dikes and by saving emergency food reserves for floods, however when the floods actually do come, you realize that the dikes constructed were substandard because of the corruption of the officials involved - since they were foolishly certain that a flood won't hit during their tenure in the government - and the reserves are not managed adequately well. I'd somehow like to add this frustrating aspect, which is a reality in Pakistan, where one must not only prepare for a disaster, but must also overcome such potential flaws in the government and the systems in place. This should make the game a bit more challenging and somewhat more real.<br /></div>
