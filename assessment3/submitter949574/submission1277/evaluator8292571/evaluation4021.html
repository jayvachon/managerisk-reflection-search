    <div class="field-value">The student is keen on succeeding the imminent danger of unmitigated risks as exemplified by equiping in the knowledge of severity and protecting the community.

Similar with the other two students, there is emphasis on the preparation stage to counter the impact of coping with realized threats.

On top of all this, this student from Pakistan made a clear point on the need for a transparent and effective government.  Despite everything one can do, without governance and honesty in implementing it, the likelihood of failing is high.  In the real world, you cannot satisfy everyone, however, if there is a strong commitment from all stakeholders, much more the government, over and beyond their own interest, there you will find a positive way to re-evaluate and make something better in their future involvement.  Government has a key role in lifting up people´s morale and expanding community´s engagement.</div>
