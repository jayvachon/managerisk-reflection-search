    <div class="field-value">Generally speaking, the student showed a good understanding of risk management aspects in their game review. However, there are some aspects that need improvement, too. The student could have been more specific about the trade-offs and choices he/she made during the game. In addition, the student did not mention what they did differently when they had to start the game over again. Finally, the idea of 'paradox of protection' is kind of vague.</div>
