    <h1>Submission 2409 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6129731, session_user_id: 61a06d563f092553f027f75f3d1785720f2e6c19)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I think this game gave quite a lot of
insight into risk management. It is often quite easy especially when looking at
policy makes to forget that there are hard decisions to be made. We might
question why there is little or no focus on protecting a city in a tsunami prone
area for instance but perhaps with limited resources it is better to focus on
developing infrastructure which will in turn lead to an increased income that
will enable the city to invest more heavily in protection. </p>

<p>The trade-off that I found I had to make
most often was between protecting my community and developing it. On the one
hand if I focused on simply developing the community without protecting it I found
that I would get damaged more often and the impacts of the strike would be
severe thereby negating any development that had taken place. On the other hand
if I chose to focus on protecting my community a lot of the time I would end up
losing the level as I would not have met development targets. If however I was
able to protect the community say up to 4 or 5 bars, I found that it was much
easier to then manage development, research and insurance. As long as the
community was protected and I had insurance I could develop fairly easily
spending more time researching comets with a high severity level and ignoring
those with a low threat.</p>

<p>The game forces you to think about trade-offs
and what is more important or more of a priority at each point. Another important
aspect is that it shows you that there is no correct formula. There is trial
and error involved in risk management and no one strategy works for everyone;
you simply have to find the strategy that works best for your situation. An
example of this is that I found whilst playing the game at the early levels it
was more beneficial to focus on insurance and developing three or four pods
very quickly and spending time on research when a particularly huge comet was
going to hit. In this way I was able to reach the development level required
quite quickly then stop developing and focus entirely on protection until time ran
out. This meant when I got to level 2 I would have at least 3 or 4 bars of
protection to begin with. As insurance got more expensive however I tended to
wait until a particularly big comet was coming before I bought it and rather
focus on developing and protecting simultaneously with a lower focus on
research.</p>

<p><span>An interesting addition to the game could
be an environmental aspect, for example an environmental bar that starts full
and reduces as development increases and perhaps if the environmental bar gets
too low it begins to hinder development in some way. I think this is an
important aspect because whilst there are many risks to development that need
to be managed there are also many risks/threats caused by development that need
to be managed as well.</span></p></div>
