    <h1>Submission 244 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3561012, session_user_id: cd35f4657726382b2fef7223f645e6a5b1b5f31e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game is basic. You need
to know the risks you face at, the probability of occurrence, the danger they
can cause to the community , and your economical devices too. Although you have
all this data and the previous tries from which you can learn what happens if
you take one or another measure, it is still very difficult to manage the
risks.</p>

<p>I learned from the game that risk management is difficult in
the level of a game. The responsability of real cases with real damages danger
exists the fear caused by a huge responsability adds another important risk to
manage!</p>

<p>What change would you propose to better represent the risk
management choices that matter in the place you live?</p>

<p>In developed areas the risk of excessive economical growth
with deplection of resources and increasing pollution could be a good example.</p>
