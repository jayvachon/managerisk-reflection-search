    <h1>Submission 2552 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2076209, session_user_id: 64c93a59491658760badbdd262ae5184928f795c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>The role of risk management in the game was
as to how to ensure that the negative impact of the comets is minimized so as
to ensure that the development goals are met in the specific time limits.</p>

<p>Choices that I made:</p>

<p>I ensured that I never wasted time to
develop and upgrade pods based on the resources that were available to me.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Trade-offs were as follows: I also
researched so as to know the severity of the comet if it hits. If the severity
was within manageable limits (i.e. if I could apply protection and be able to
reach required level of protection within limited time) then I focused on
protection else I just bought some insurance. But I didn’t spend more than a
couple of seconds in research because I anyway had a tentative idea and needed
to take action (protection or insurance) in the limited time available.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>When I played the game the second time I
ensured that</p>

<p>a.      
I didn’t waste a single second idling</p>

<p>b.     
I didn’t try for protection is potential
severity was very high</p>

<p>c.      
I didn’t focus only on risk management but also
met development goals</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The main things that I learnt from the game are:</p>

<p>a.      
Risk management is very critical but at the same
time one must not lose track of the development goals</p>

<p>b.     
A-priori knowledge about what are the tools
available to manage risks is very essential so that when the event is about to
occur decision making on which tool to apply can done based on risk severity
potential</p>

<p> </p>

<p>  </p>

<p>If I were to develop a new version of the game where I could
add/change one simple thing based on better representation of risk management
choices in the place where I live, then it would be:</p>

<p>a.      
Preventive – fund research on innovation that
can completely eliminates the probability of comets to fall and create
destruction</p></div>
