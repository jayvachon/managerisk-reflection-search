    <h1>Submission 91 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7200643, session_user_id: e7bfa95727426455f6cd2187bdcb4e111a035fec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p><span>The role of
risk management in this game was the trade-off between building up the
infrastructure in the country and coping with risk. Coping with risk could be
done in three ways, either by insurance, by protecting against the meteorites
or by researching (i.e. knowledge).  I
focused on the insurance and protection part, however, when spending money on
these two risk-management strategies you could not build up the infrastructure
as fast as you would like to. And if I understood the game correctly, getting
the buildings to at least level 3 gave them a lot of protection in themselves. Preparation
for risked made the development slower. It might have been better to focus more
on insurance (and maybe knowledge) instead of spending a lot of money on the
protection part. However, all three of them would be needed.</span>

<p>If I were
to play the game again, I would focus more on research and less on protection
(even though I would use both of them). In the beginning of the game I believe
that is important to get some protection in order to avoid large damages on the
buildings. When having built all the buildings, I believe it is most important
to focus on the insurance part, so that if the protection measure does not work
you do not need to pay for full repair damages. Finally, when you are building more
robust buildings (i.e. going to level 2 and 3 of the building – I did not get
any further), I believe it is more important to focus on the research part in
order gain more knowledge about these meteorites.</p>

<p>In this
game I learned more about the trade-offs in risk management, and in particular
that when you have a limited budget it is not possible to invest in all
measures and at the same time have a quick development. </p>

<p>I live in
Norway one of the world’s richest countries. Considering individual risk, we
have good insurances both privately and through the government (social security
and so on). Furthermore, natural disasters are rare and if they happen (mainly
great fires and hurricanes), the government are quick to help out in the area.
If I would want to change the game, one way could be to make it more realistic
maybe for a local farmer in a poor country. For instance, instead of just
facing one risk (here meteorites), others could be included as well. In the
example for a local farmer, this could be natural disasters (drought, fires,
landslide, etc), illness, and so on. </p>
