    <div class="field-value">(I) Key Strength of the Reflection, as I perceive: The highlight of the game through Levels I-III mentioned is quite impressive though its not emperical and merely based on individual assumptions and the mode & sample of the “Business Strategy” game, that one has been experienced, which is likely to vary everytime one attempts a game based on multiple factors.
Further, it is notable of the suggestion made in the latter part that the game should progress in an incremental manner than to force one to attempt it from the start to rush through the primary phase yet again, which is monotonous by inputs, except the rate at which mitigation should happen is likely to ramp up during every attempt.
I acknowledge that there were a few bugs in the course of the game, which can be ingored. However, kindly note that the Insurance controls were deliberately placed on the phenomenon of “Least Cost” factor, which entails a minimum buffer that was a knowledge input built within the game, rather than allowing the business strategy manager (the player) to analyze and fall short of the required financial stability in the disaster prone areas, subject to a lot of externalities, in the process.

(II) Suggestions to respresent the reflection better: It appears that the reflect attmepts to improve the game's outlook by altering the factors to suit the levels of play. However, it isn't a cumulative measure of the development incurred, but a test of sustainability and development, which is the “Challenge”. It would have be appreciable if the concepts of inter-play of various players are analysed vis-a-vis the several elements provided for  protection, knowledge management and coping as supplementary mechanisms, in terms of “Econometrics and Management”.</div>
