    <h1>Submission 1971 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3290781, session_user_id: db52df9004ef4dcd424b5ead97b02d06944f714c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1</p>

<p>What was the role of risk management in the game? What
choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of
knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk
affect development (immediately, or after some time)?</p>

<p> The
game was about making a choice of the level or insurance, protection and
information gathering. In the beginning I was trying to maximise the insurance and
the protection and paid little attention to the information regarding the probability
and the impact of the risk, and I could not complete level 3,as insurance just
minimised the financial impact of destructions but did not reduce their
occurrence. Then I realised that I should start developing protection and in
parallel obtain the information, in order to decide on my actions. I used
insurance in a couple of times when the impact was very high and the
probability of occurrence more than 40%, and in parallel I tried to increase
the level of protection with one additional point for risk minimisation. I did
not take any action for risks with impact less then 3 or risks with medium
impact and low probability.</p>

<p>If you played the game only once, what would you do
differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game
more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the
main things you learned from the game?</p>

<p> As mentioned above I played the game numerous times
until I managed to reach level 5. In the beginning I was focusing on obtaining
insurance, the build protection and paid little attention to the information.
Then I realised that I should start building basic protection and then analyse
the information before taking any action. In general the primary goal was to
increase protection in order to deal with the impact of the risk, and add
insurance in the cases of very high impact. Therefore I learned that
information is key and we need to find the right balance between protection and
insurance.</p>

<p> </p><p>3</p>

<p>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects
of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the
game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you
propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the
place you live?</p>

<p> In general the game provides the opportunity to trade
off between protection, insurance and information. What is not very clear is
the financial resources increase. There is no rule or at least a clear one on
how the money available is increased over time and sometimes it seems that they
are infinite. Living in southern Europe the last 5 years made me realise that
resources and more particular financial resources are not unlimited. Therefore,
if I could change something in the game would be the way that resources are
available and are increased over time.</p>
