    <div class="field-value">In my view, the Key strength of this reflection is as mentioned in para 2 of the reflections that the ultimate goal is to pursue the targeted development while preparing for all the possible risks.
In the last para, the person has assumed that there are no people and the player would like to add people to the game, which I find totally wrong because all the development is done by the people only and there are already living creatures on the island. It is wrong to assume that the development is happening in vacuum in the absence of any life.</div>
