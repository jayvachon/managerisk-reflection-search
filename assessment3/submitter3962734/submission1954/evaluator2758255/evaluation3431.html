    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that it is straightforward. The reflection would have benefited from a better understanding of the importance of development and the role of knowledge. Risk management is not solely about preventing damage. The main point of managing risks is to maximize growth while also preparing for possible losses. If people or communities are focused only on protecting themselves from possible harm, they will miss out on opportunities for increasing their wealth and quality of life.

In the game, the player is usually more successful when development is slightly prioritized over protection. Insurance and protection are still necessary, but resources don't need to be heavily allocated to protection until research indicates that the risk of damage is more likely. In the meantime, more development allows the player to enlarge the budget and meet the level's goals. With more wealth, the player will be in a better position to invest in protection when a disaster is near.</div>
