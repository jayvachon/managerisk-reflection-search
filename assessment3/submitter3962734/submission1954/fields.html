    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>What was the role of risk management in the game? <br />The role of risk managment in the game was to prevent the economic losses that came from the asteroid impacts.<br /><br />What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? <br />In terms of knowlodge i choose to do less investments in infrastructures, more in insurance and protection, A small number of structures is better then a larger mumber.<br /><br />In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?<br />Preparation for risk affect the budget and therefore we can't develop as much as we want because the budget is too small, only after sometme we have enough infrastructure to earn enough budget that allows more development.<br /><br /></span><span>If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?<br />If i played the game only once, i would put a limited number of infrastructures, investing on insurance, in order to go to the next level, which doesn't result well with a large number of infrastructures. Large investement on better structures is not a good investment because when asteroids collide the time to recovery the stuctures is greater and in some cases its the end of the level.<br /><br />Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time?<br /></span>As said before i would put a limited number of infrastructures, investing on insurance, in order to go to the next level, which doesn't result well with a large number of infrastructures. Large investement on better structures is not a good investment because when asteroids collide the time to recovery the stuctures is greater and in some cases its the end of the level.<br /><span>After playing the game several times i cannot learn what was the adequate level of investment in better structures, knowledge, protection and insurance, and the impact of consecutive asteroids a few seconds of the end of the level with 77% damage is not fair for anyone.<br /><br />What were the main things you learned from the game?<br /></span><span>The main things i learn with these game was that it was a big waste of time, its not clear to me what is supose to learn with a game like these, meanwhile when i evaluate my peers maybe i understand what was the main point of the game, now i´m lost.<br /><br /></span><span>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?<br /></span>This is a tricky question, can anyone deal with the risk of asteroids hitting is home? I think not. What about more than one asteroid falling in the same place? No.<br />As a metaphor we can say that in life there are somethings that we do not expect, like storms, floods, tornadoes, and other nature risks, and what we can do about it is minimize the economic risk of the damages cause by it doing insurance, but that´s it. Insurance only prevent economic losses not other losses, like if you loose your father or mother, insurance only gives you money, if you have a disease in which you can´t work, insurance only pays your economic loss not gives you back your health,<br /><br /><br /></div>
