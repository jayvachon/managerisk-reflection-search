    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>General:<br />The game is
a good idea, but in my opinion also a waste of time. I tried it several times
to figure out how it works. Then I could reach level 5 without problems. In
level 6 I got 2 times a “fatal error” and could not go on. <br />In the beginning I
tried to build all PODs in the same speed. But only when I build only 3 and
focused on upgrading them I had enough money in the higher levels. <br />The highest
priority is to get no damages. Therefore I always tried to have the protection
level as high as possible. Only in the first level is enough time to increase
the protection by several meters. And by the way – increasing the protection level
creates money in the game which helps to build faster – but is this realistic?
<br />I found out that an insurance makes no sense in the game because the bottleneck
is the lost time not the money. <br />Concerning the research I got the impression
that it has nearly no advantage in the game. <br />Concerning the severity of the
comets I am a bit confused because it was sometimes much higher as the research
displayed <br />(9 meters instead of 7).</p>

<p>1)<br />Role of
risk management: To have a very high protection level.<br />Trade-offs:
A few upgraded PODs earn much more money as a lot of basic PODs.<br />Insurance:
In the game I could avoid damages. Insurances were therefore obsolete.<br />Preparation
for risk – big advantage: No time and money lost for repairmen =&gt; quicker
development.<br />=&gt; See also “General”</p>

<p>2)<br />The second
time I only build 3 PODs and improved them: Only when I had too much money it
started to build the others. <br />Only a high
level of development makes it easy to build additional PODs. The higher
developed a country is the easier it is to do additional developments.</p>

<p>3)<br />Add a
simple thing to the game: Education – costs at the moment but helps in the long
run.</p><span>
