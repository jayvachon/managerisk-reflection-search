    <h1>Submission 2562 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5753099, session_user_id: 709642a20d0474ab2d79da1afce657b79409e612)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Riskhorizon reflects the difficulties of risk management within a developing world with scarce ressources very well. It is actually very difficult to finance both development and risk reduction measures at the same time. On the one hand risk reduction measures are costly and have to be financed with resources that are needed for development measures as well. Nevertheless, they are indispensable as development is very likely to be destroyed if hazards hit the community and cause widespread damage. At the same time, community leaders do not only have to decide whether to invest in development or in risk reduction measures. They also have to decide with risk reduction measures to chose. So primarily, they have to decide whether to invest in risk transfer measures or in protection measures. The game actually showed how difficult it is to decide whether to invest in one or the other. In the face of unknown risks this decision is actually hard to take. Nevertheless, the game is even simpler than the reality. In reality, risk managers have to prepare for a multitude of different risk and they have to prepare for these risks in different ways. In the game, insurance and protection measures can be taken for "risk" in general. In reality, the scarce resources have to be divided in order to prepare for health risks, risks from natural hazards... As well, in reality, complexity is also increased by the challenge of reaching a certain level of social equality and inclusive growths. As such, "riskhorizon" can be regarded as a game illustrating very well certain aspects of challenges faced in the real world of today.<br /></div>
