    <div class="field-value">What I found impressive in this reflection is how the author was able to relate the game to scenarios that can happen on real life. It also is particularly commendable that he incorporated ideas that were discussed in the forums.

However, I believe the reflection could have been better written. I understand that the author may not be a native English speaker. Punctuation errors made some of the sentences/paragraphs hard to understand. Also, some of the ideas were scattered and not organized cohesively. Perhaps it would be good if the author would try to revise his work before submitting a paper.

Regardless, I found the author's insights useful and interesting. Good job. </div>
