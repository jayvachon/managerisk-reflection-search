    <h1>Submission 1609 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1075259, session_user_id: c3e76ed18a0947d002c795a7b0c80e6167797e40)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><h2>1 What was the role of risk management in the game? What
choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of
knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk
affect development (immediately, or after some time)?</h2>

<p>Risk management is implied when you decide
to invest more in development of the pots if the risk of impact of comets and
the severity associated with the impact is below your protection and insurance
limits.</p>

<p>It was better to research over comets with
most severity effects, then, if the probability of impact is moderate or high
the best action was to elevate the protection level, and if the probability of
impact and severity was high, then invest on insurance.</p>

<p>When you apply risk management in the game,
the chance for accelerate development are biggest than if you do not apply.</p>

<h2>2 If you played the game only once, what would you do
differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game
more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the
main things you learned from the game?</h2>

<p>I tried very different alternatives. For
example, not research over comets (this was a disastrous option), not to buy
insurance at all (if you upgrade the protection level in the right moment it is
a good option), to build pots for levels or by contrary build one or two to the
most high level (in this case the better option was build the cheapest option
in each moment, for example, you build first a pot for 200$, then improve the
pot for 175, then build a new pot, and so on).</p>

<p>The main thing I learned (better
re-learned) from the game is how can simply rules can produce a complex scenario.</p>

<h2>3 The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of
risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the
game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you
propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the
place you live?</h2>

<p><span>I would change the community cooperation
after impacts for some random value in function of the variables of the game at
the moment, and not measure the ability of move the mouse. In the same way, I
would add some cooperation abilities, for instance, people in each pot and
possibility to rebuild damage in function of population.</span></p></div>
