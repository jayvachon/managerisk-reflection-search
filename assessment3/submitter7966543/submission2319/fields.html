    <h1>Submission 2319 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7966543, session_user_id: d0ee3f23d87baf3893054a5b11be99662d3015d5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management was so useful in this game for me. In the beginning it was not easy to control and reach the goal. But after wards, I got the control in my hand and fortunately I could reach level 4 in the game. 
<br />I tried to use all of my opportunities on time and with the organized prioritization. I built 3 pods at the same time then protect up to level one after that bought the insurance. Then tried to develop the existing pods following by increasing knowledge and protect them. After reaching to the safe step, I started developing. 
<br />In my mind, just developing without preparing the enough strong and safe base is not good … because with any risk suddenly happened we will lose time, cost, assets &amp; … 
.<br />Developing should prepare after some time when upgrading is done enough to the minimum safe level. 
<br />I would focus on protection and upgrading more than other items, I would use my extra money for protection. If any money left the insurance level should increase equal to upgrade level.  Updating the knowledge would be done all over the game. 
<br />In my opinion 2 elements which are so important in risk management are budget &amp; time. In practice there are so many obstacles that cause the unstable control on risk management. 
For developing this game to the new version I would like to add an emergency item which can active and help protection item when the building &amp; developing is going on. 
<br />In the place where I live, there are so many obstacles on the way of risk management in practice. So, the knowledge should be prepare and announce on time and correctly. Then, use the budget on the right way for the exact pointed risk. In such a risky place as mine, I think identify priorities is very important as well. 
<br />At the end, I should point the most important thing in risk management: keeping balance between the helpful different elements all over the project.</div>
