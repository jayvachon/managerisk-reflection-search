    <div class="field-value">I like how the student relates the game's requirements and the real life requirements to balance the various stakeholders' requirements, and how the student's considerations are improved over a period of time.
This reflection is very useful as it takes into consideration of the community feedback, rather than just a manager's or administrator's consideration.  
To make this reflection better, the student could probably include real life experience on the various requirements of the game.</div>
