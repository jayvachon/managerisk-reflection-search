    <h1>Submission 2605 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3046089, session_user_id: 6778f664cd8336a11dd8b099028e06e22634cf48)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk
management in the game has different way to control risk: time,
research, capital, protection, plot building updating and insurance. It was a column
which indicates the status of your risk. </p>

<p><span>The first time that
played I could not reach the III level. Because my strategy was too poor.  I did not consider insurance and
protection.  Next I changed to consider
protection and insurance, and update the plot to better building together with research.  In this way I arrived to III level, but it
was enough to arrive at the IV level.  I
need to consider the money that I need to leave for the next level, otherwise
it was almost impossible to insure my plots. 
With this new strategic I arrived to the IV level and I was so happy to
see my plots in a beautiful garden!  All
strong and in good shape!</span></p>

<p><span>I need to consider
also the growing for the plots and the money that I have to spend. It was very
interesting that if I grow my plot so fast in which the money was too low, I couldn’t
have money for the insurance to the next level.  I need to choose efficiency between the time
that I have a disposition, with the researcher, and growing. </span></p>

<p><span>The game capture all
the important risk managements, like catastrophic, liquidity, insurance,
protection and linked between the plots (community), but I would like to  see what is the level of the risk, and some
kind of diversification of the risks!.  May
be it is possible to include other kind of risks like mortality, etc.  when the plots are getting older and/or living
longer. </span></p></div>
