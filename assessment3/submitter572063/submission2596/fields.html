    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was about building a community but, with the risk of protecting it from the meteors. To overcome this, a heavy research was conducted on the behavior of the meteors in order to ensure its severity level and the community was insured as well to cope with the damages.<br /><br />The first time my intention was only to expand the community whereas the next time it was about learning about the risk , protecting the community and also efficiently coped up with the consequence of a bad hit.</div>
