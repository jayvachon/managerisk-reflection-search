    <h1>Submission 126 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8006966, session_user_id: 20728dc26cc3071e9d66bbd9c0991574dce2e5e4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
The role of risk management in the game was to
basically assist me to mitigate the inevitable shock that would hit my community
as a result of the meteors by making use of the insurance, research and the
protection tools for effective risk management.</p><p>Another role was to assist me mitigate this risk in a cost effective manner by attaching costs to all the tools of effective risk management made available to me. This, not just making a choice of tool, but to make the one in which the benefit outweighs its cost. </p>

<p>The choices I made were that I tried to
research on time to have knowledge of the meteors, then immediately went to
purchase an insurance to militate against the shock. Protection was my last
choice. Even though I later realized after I thought about it that protecting should have been my next immediate option after getting an adequate knowledge of the meteors, this would made the impact of the shocks lesser than it would have been without protection. </p>

<p>Preparation affected my development in that
It made me make a decision on the right time to develop and the cost of repair
or rebuild would be if there is a likely damage after the shock. </p>

<p>2.      
If I had to play the game again a second time,
what I will do differently is to protect against the shocks so as to reduce the
cost of the impact of the shock on my community. Afterwards, I will purchase insurance
at the lowest price to mitigate for the reduced cost of the likely
impact/damage. </p>

<p>3.      
The change I would propose to better represent
the risk management choices that matter in the place I live is the ability to
cope after the shock aftermath. </p>
