    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I have played the game couple of times, but either it is too difficult, either I am not very good at games, the number of levels I have passed is small. It did reveal though couple of important aspects to consider when discussing risk. <br />My strongest impression about this game is that, if with other games you are given the illusion of controlling the game (or at least influence it significantly with your skills), here is just hazard. It felt a bit frustrating in the beginning, later on I realized it is just like in life. Risks are hazard and can`t be really connected to anything. <br />With regards to the tools available, insurance seemed crucial, as it could remove the financial burden with up to 75 %. (I have later realized that repairing took longer with a bigger insurance. This is important as during the shape up we can`t develop and we can`t progress, which means less chances to win because of time constraint.) Research also helped, as knowing the size of the danger could assist us with the right amount of caution. Growth and development seemed the most obvious and very well adapted to the real world. It is not possible to defend properly without developed cities. The button next to pause did nothing in my case, or at least I could not notice any changes when pushed or not. The game is a simplified version of an outside threat, giving us the main tools to protect. I have learned that succeeding to overcome risks it is a matter of time management and rightful way of  using resources. Development and money must be balanced and it is crucial to take prompt actions, or else they will not matter anymore. A very important point the game made is that while you are recovering you can`t develop. As it has been advertised, a copy of the reality. <br />Playing the game has been very educational, even if I have to admit that repairing a 70% damage seconds before the final and loosing in this way was not... making me happy. But it did prove the point. I have played couple of times and then read the description above. This is when I realized that I have experimented a bit with what is doing what, yet did not change much in my approach to the game. Learning is a key point and stop repeating what we have always done (like one experience repeated many times, looking for luck), being open to new and to options is what makes us better. I will try to remember this outside pods too....<br />Risk management had the clear role of minimizing damages and ensure progress. Because the tools were not very well differentiated (or I was not good at the game), I have when paid more insurance and ran out of time, when developed better and ran out of money, when tried to research and see what happens (it did not diminished the impact or the damages, the recovery time or anything else.)  <br />The main thing I have learned is that ignoring is the worse one can do. That no matter how much you try, hazard is hazard and that, in this game, time goes fast. It proved the point that the only reactions that mater are those taken in a timely manner. <br /></div>
