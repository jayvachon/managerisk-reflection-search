    <div class="field-value">Risk Horizon Reflections by Iyobosa Hope Izevbigie
Risk management is the systematic processes of identifying, analysing and responding to risks -PMBOK.  In the game, Risk horizon, I identified the risk to the community as falling meteors which causes flooding and created a buffer by way of "Insurance", I analysed the risk by way of "Research" and responded to the risk by way of "Protect".

Insurance: this allowed me have adequate disaster recovery plan. No matter,the level of destruction caused by the falling meteors, insurance made rebuilding and upgrading easier, faster and cheaper.

Research: allowed me to quantify the risk by evaluating the meteors and prioritising the level of risk and uncertainty and quantify their frequency of occurence and impact. It also was the fastest way to turn the indicator light from red to green thereby reaching your goal faster than would have been possible.

Protect: allowed me to develop response to the identified threat by raising the level of the island in order to either eliminate the threat, deflect the threat or accept the threat and be prepared for it by raising the protection bar level. Raising the level of the community decreases the risk or impact of destruction. Though it seems the best option, it takes too long to get a bar on the protection scale and takes longer to reach your goal.

In level one, I quickly discovered that knowledge makes the task easier and completes faster so immexiately after building pods, I got a good insurance plan and then proceeded to get knowledge in order to reach my goal faster. I actually did more of research and less of protecting because the time between the sighting of the meteor in the horizon and its impact was  short.

Immediately the game started, I went for an insurance plan to give the community some level of coverage. I alternated between research and protecting because I needed to balance both in order to achieve my goal.

I played the game more than once and I,realised  the mistake I made was that not properly balancing my options lead to failure to complete the given task.

The most important thing I learnt from the game was the power of insurance. I realised that the cost of repairs and upgrading was far more cheaper with a goood insurance plan. 

In the game itself, I would give more time to complete each level and make the acquisition of protection bars faster. In the area where I live in, I would emphasis the benefits ofiinsurance and help my neighbours get a good insurance plan for their properties.</div>
