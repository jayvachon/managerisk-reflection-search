    <h1>Submission 113 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2744569, session_user_id: 0f49ab44dda21e15eb11c0535fc50b5b08c0385a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the earliest stages of development I engaged some basic protection &amp;
insurance to cope with effect of impact (when there was possibility of impact).
When I was increasing protection society stalled in development for a while because of limited resources but this
definitely helped in future and after impact because there were lover or no damages and
society could now develop faster. It turned out that by reaching certain points in
the society you definitely have to protect yourself to reduce costs that could occur in future. Â </p>

<p>With increase of level and development it is good to increase insurance to
higher level, especially when confronted with constant disaster. Less cost
occurs with better insurance and in ih highly developed societies cost could be
enormous. This way you will have more resources to work on your development and
investigating other possibilities for development. Also level of protection
should be high if there are constant threats because if huge disaster hits you
it could take ages &amp; huge amounts of resources for you to recover. Sitting
around and doing nothing costs just too much.</p>

<p>First time I played I made mistake by not involving insurance which later
helped me to reduce costs drastically and reach higher levels because I had
more resources that could be used for development and not for repairing damages
(I invested more before there was possibility of higher damage or if there were
some constant threats).</p>

<p><span>For this game I would definitely add additional ways of protection,
something like huge canon :D</span></p></div>
