    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>GAME REFLEXION</b></p>

<p>The role
of risk management in the game:</p>

<p>The risk
management role was of improving the performance by mitigating shocks and
unwelcome surprises; and implying control of possible future events, reducing
the magnitude of shocks’ impact as well. The risk management also allocated the
risks in this game.</p>

<p>Trade-offs
I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance and choices made:</p>

<p>Knowledge </p>

<p>On knowledge,
I didn’t understand shocks and the potential effect to ensure protection.</p>

<p>Protection
</p>

<p>The
challenges I confronted are that I didn’t knew that however the protection is,
to ensure a lot is also important because it makes an easier reconstruction if
damages occurred.</p>

<p>Insurance
</p>

<p>I knew
that insurance is for overtime and I didn’t do it to ensure the resources
transfer intending effective resilience.</p>

<p>Ways the
preparation for risk affect development</p>

<p>As
preparation, knowledge-protection and insurance constitute pre-risk management
activities; it implies right, specific and certain strategic risk management
plan and ensure right and appropriate immediate defense/action to manage shocks
and preserve to overcome its impact.</p>

<p>This
will ensure sustainable and or guaranteed development plan</p>

<p>The
thing I did differently is to not repeating the mistakes I made before</p>

<p>And as I
played the game more than once, after the first game I tried to meet the gap
and instaure guaranteed protective and insurance measures.</p>

<p>The main
things I learned are: </p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Risk
management awareness and learning from the past; </p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Early
and real time to insure /to render the risk management effective;</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Event
impacts mitigation through protective measures.</p>

<p>Proposal
to better risk management choice</p>

<p>For a
better representation of the risk management choices, in my place, I can propose
to add to the game, a risk-assessment tool for risk assessment probability and
severity, to ensure the appropriate risk management choice in matter of
choosing insurance and building a fitting protection towards the shocks.</p>
