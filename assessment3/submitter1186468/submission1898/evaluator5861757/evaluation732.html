    <div class="field-value">They key strength of this reflection is the way the student explains the different strategies he/she came up with as he/she played more and more times. One thing I believe would make this reflection better is to add one more remark on what the student said the role of risk management was: that the role of risk management is not only to assess the damage after being hit, but also prepare against the possibility of loss BEFORE being hit. </div>
