    <div class="field-value">Your observation on the lack of enforcement of building codes near you is keen. However, the trade-offs you confront could be described in terms of the role of knowledge (research), protection, and insurance using the definitions provided in the grading rubric: https://class.coursera.org/managerisk-001/wiki/Game_Reflection_Grading_Rubric. Protection is missing and should be added. Because this is a technical writing and not literature, the pronoun "I" and the first letter of each sentence should be capitalized. The second sentence is a run-on sentence with two interrogative sentences with no question and quotation marks. The choices could be spelled out instead.</div>
