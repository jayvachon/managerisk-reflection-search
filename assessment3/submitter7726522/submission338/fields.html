    <h1>Submission 338 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7726522, session_user_id: 6909f6319fff99b9ec2e870a60f01dc6b4a49099)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>The Game!! Love the Science Fiction motif</b><br /><br /><p>The game was clearly intended to
balance risks and rewards as well as prioritize risks in the system. Choices I
made were based on what are the rewards and risks in the game. The game seemed
to incentivize protection, which was an intuitive choice, as the risk of losing
lives would be a priority. However it seemed that losing lives was an
acceptable risk as long as insurance and knowledge as to the meteor hitting was
concerned. This was counterintuitive, and it seemed to be the wrong way to go.</p>

<p>I did play the game some three
times. Being a professional in risk management myself, I found that I was
unable to sacrifice lives for the chance that I may have better insurance
payout. Does it bother me? Not at all. What I did learn is that there are
different perspectives in how one looks at such 'risks' ... though in reality,
it is a much more nuanced interpretation of a basket of risks. I found some of the nuances missing. Some are 'fixed' mitigants, some are variable and risks need to be managed on timelines, geographies, across groups and are far more intricate. The sacrifices one makes are commensurate with the risk-reward curve.</p>

<p>The game is very simple in its
inputs, and has a number of lacunae, which I'm not discussing in the interest
of brevity. But being in India, I would focus on quality of life, add things
like investments in water, food security, and power security. I would also have
less of skill and more of strategy and not have a game based on timing. There
are many ways to manage risks, not all of them are equal or even feasible, but
the logic is inescapable. My criticism is that the game failed to bring out the
qualitative aspect of risk management and give some learning in this area.</p>

<p>I would do a lot of things
different. There are strategy games such as <i>Command
and Conquer</i>, which have the requisite elements which can be modified for a
risk game which could act as a learning tool and be hours of fun as well. I actually made a game called 'Bourse Game' which was made for managing treasury risks in one of the largest banks in the world. It would have been an interesting exercise to comingle some of the components of such a game.</p><p>Link to Command and Conquer enclosed:Â <a href="http://www.ea.com/command-and-conquer-red-alert-3-premier" title="Link: http://www.ea.com/command-and-conquer-red-alert-3-premier">http://www.ea.com/command-and-conquer-red-alert-3-premier</a> </p><p><br /></p></div>
