    <div class="field-value">It is really upsetting that this student writes on this assignment as if he is writing a text to a teenager on his/her cellphone. there are problems with parallel structure, spelling and clarity. She/he is right when he complains about the game that is not well structured.  I was replanting the pods all the time and got no credit. However, I agree that the game should be more life-like using combinations of other risks like financial crises, epidemics, massive accidents like a derailed train  or bus or an explosion in a fireworks factory or a nuclear reactor etc. </div>
