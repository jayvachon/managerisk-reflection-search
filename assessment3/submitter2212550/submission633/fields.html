    <h1>Submission 633 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2212550, session_user_id: 67fa1f2ab911f0d0bdafc591d270789e77b3cce5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>1) We had to make the trade off between spending resources in defense, building construction and insurance and investing our time between those activities or research on the comets.<br />I started building first and buying insurance and defense as soon as I saw the comets arriving (so leaving some cash on the side for there). Also, when I was low in cash, I would do research while the pods were being built. <br />Preparing ahead is definitely important, and buying insurance made it a lot easier managing risk. <br /><br />2) I played the game twice and the difference is that the second time I started purchasing some insurance, usually I tried to go for the highest, if I had enough money, which was the case. <br />The main things that I learnt:<br />-buy insurance<br />-invest as much as you can, but leave a bit of cash aside for rainy days; when you don't have anything urgent to do, do a lot of research, that really makes the difference.<br /><br />3) In the game every area was hit in the same way, while what happens in real life is that some are hit less badly and some areas are worse. I think would be interesting adding a feature able to differentiate the areas and once research is done, to have the game signal you which ones are the most dangerous areas to avoid constructing them.<br />Moreover we could introduce some buildings more resistant than others (so we can put them in riskier areas) and have them to become more safe the more research we do.</span></div>
