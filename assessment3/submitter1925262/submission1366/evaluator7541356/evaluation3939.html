    <div class="field-value">Key Strength - The balance and trade-offs with knowledge, protection, and insurance were described well. I think you bring a thoughtful point about the fixed aspects of the game in your response to Q3. It was also interesting to read about your unique situation - living in an area that is prone to earthquakes.

One thing to make reflection better - I'm sorry to hear you weren't able to go past level 2. I found that I had to sacrifice knowledge/research and focus more on protection and insurance. This way I was able to reach level 4.</div>
