    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. In the game, the primary role of risk management was to foster balanced risk prevention. I focused on strengthening protection while at the same time developing several plots and securing insurance. Protection, as a preventive measure, was of crucial importance to sustainable development because once a meteor struck, it was already very challenging to restore and take enough time to prepare to deal with subsequent (possible) meteor strikes. In addition, when the level of protection was high, there were only few occasions on which a large sum of money had to be spent repairing damaged plots. I came to realise that the higher the level of protection is the easier it becomes to manage finance and continue development processes. One big challenge I was faced with was that the data telling me about the chances of meteor strikes was not very helpful. Because I did not want to be reliant on chances, I tended to get insurance all the time, which was not quite efficient in terms of financial management.<br /><br />2. I would not change the way I played the game significantly. Having said that, I may have concentrated excessively on enhancing protection. Since I did not make inexorable progress on development, I would probably invest a little less wealth in protection and instead increase the amount of wealth spent building and upgrading plots in order to achieve full prosperity. Moreover, I would not continue purchasing insurance when it does not seem necessary, which would save me a fair amount of money that I can further invest in the building and upgrading of plots.<br /><br />3. I would probably keep all aspects of the game, but I would like to add one dimension which is the control over budget. In the game, I continued to make money at a certain pace, but I did not know where it was coming from. Besides, I could not make more or less money as I wanted. If I had had control over the amount of money earned for development processes, it would have been possible for me to manage risk more effectively and accelerate the development of the planet. As of now I have no clear idea as to how gamers may have control over the accumulation of wealth aside from spending less on insurance and protection. However, it would definitely enable gamers to manage risks more effectively and efficiently while managing to continue development processes if there was a way for them to gain more wealth by doing something, for example allocating the fiscal budget, negotiating development aid, and so forth.<br /></div>
