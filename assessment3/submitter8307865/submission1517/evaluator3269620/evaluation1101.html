    <div class="field-value">The author does a good job of reflecting on the experience the author had in playing the game.  

With respect to clarity, the account could have been better organized.  Also, some improvement is needed on connecting sentences (and paragraphs).  By this, I mean a following sentence, (paragraph) should be better connected to (flow from) the preceding sentence (paragraph).

With respect to comprehension, I believe the first sentence mistates the goal of the game.  The goal of the game is not to make the community stable, strong, and prosperous but to demonstrate what risk management is.
