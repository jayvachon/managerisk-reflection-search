    <h1>Submission 844 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 779722, session_user_id: 25e834cc1c6d61fa055ed2b4ee99229ecc1aceea)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> The Risk Horizon game included several of the concepts we have been learning about in the course. It helped to reinforce the idea that risk management has a cost and requires resources, but can pay off in future benefits. One of the biggest things I learned is that the more experience I had with the game, the better I got at managing my resources and preparing for disaster, which is a direct correlation to what we see in the real world. <br /><br /> Using the knowledge I gained from studying the meteors, I made better choices about the insurance coverage I purchased and the physical protection I put in place. Research in the game had a cost, but it gave me a better chance of protecting myself in the event of a meteor strike. I learned as I played that I could mitigate some of the damage if I reacted quickly following a meteor strike and if I had done enough research. This is often the case when disaster strikes in the real world and this relates to the necessity of emergency response and contingency planning for individuals, businesses, communities, and governments. <br /><br /> I could have put nearly all of my money into insurance, research, and physical protection, but in order to advance my settlement, I needed as much money as possible to put toward development, while keeping a reserve to repair any damages my structures received that were not covered by insurance. <br /><br /> If I were to play the game again, I would do more development early on, since this brings in more revenue and if I purchased the right amount of insurance and reacted quickly following the disaster, I tended to sometimes have large reserves of money that could have been put into development, thereby allowing me to reach a higher level. Therefore, while we are often not prepared enough, we must not sacrifice progress by over-preparation. We must find a good balance between investment and risk management. <br /><br /> There are some types of hazards that are not captured by the game. In the game we were able to see what was coming and learn about the specific threat usually well before it hit. When dealing with things such as flooding due to large storms, or shake damage or tsunamis due to earthquakes, we may have some historical data that gives us a probability of occurrence, but not have much warning with regard to the specific threat. A future version of the game could include this kind of threat, giving us the probability of an event at any given time, without any warning of when it is coming. This type of hazard requires some level of readiness at all times and therefore requires a different strategy and allocation of funds.</p></div>
