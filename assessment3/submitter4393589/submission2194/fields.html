    <h1>Submission 2194 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4393589, session_user_id: ca607d1101a76de441279bf8d130b885cf4aea84)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of the risk management in the game I think was to
always be prepared to different threats that may come (being resilient). In the
game the main threat are the comets and You also have the time as something
that may destroy your community. In real life countries have more variables
that impair our lives like different natural desasters, job loss, lack of
opportunity to take more risks to development (incentives). Etc.</p>

<p>During the game I didn’t try to be protected much time so I
do not know what may happen, but I think IF focused on protection you wouldn’t
develop and miss the comets that by searching them you can develop and gain some
time when hitted. Insurance I didn’t think it helped me didn’t understand it</p>

<p>Even though You might be well in your game – a good
development in community and resources available like protection and ensurance,
an external shock, comets may destroy your game for good. So You think, it’s
not fair I was going so well and now for sure I have to start all over again. </p>

<p>I think the game shows us that life is not fair, especially
environmental impacts , in this case. There is a difference between the game
and real life , like when it happens a desaster and you have many resources in
the game you won’t be able to recover because of the time is almost over. In
real life if you have the resources and preparation, knowledge and ability to
cope afterwards You Will be able to suffer less with that impact, but that is
not what happens in most cases, because it happens most with the poor people.</p>

<p>I think a change I would do in the game is when the time is
going over and your community is almost full, with insurance and protection, we
could have the chance to press the insurance tab and Exchange it for time.</p></div>
