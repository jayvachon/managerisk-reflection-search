    <div class="field-value">From the reflection submitted by this student, I can observe that the student had played the game thoroughly and seem to understand it better than myself. His observation of Insurance being most effective at 33% and 75% is something I didn't quite notice. I personally thought basic insurance at 33% was okay. At most I went for 50% insurance. I never thought 75% insurance was necessary. I don't know if I'm right about this. especially if the community is sufficiently reduce damage by impact. I personally think that buying 75% insurance just about reduces your income that could be plowed into other development activities.</div>
