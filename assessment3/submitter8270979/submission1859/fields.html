    <h1>Submission 1859 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8270979, session_user_id: 9e98205c3abfdb6351e7f70002d9c18efa08e2df)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I was not really impressed with the game as it is not clear
what were the risks and the goals of the activity. Once I saw the comets, I did
realize the comet was the danger that I was supposed to analyze and confront.
But I did not understand it from the beginning and did not even plan for it in
the first round of the game. In the second round, I knew I had to face the
comet, so I build the I-pads far from the area where the comet was likely to
strike and I also upgraded them as much as I could, I also regularly looked at
the research on each of the comet. The research was not accurate – and I do not
think that the research is always accurate. I am a research and our data come
80-95% true to the reality. So, if the research is not accurate, there is a
big risk regardless of the strategy you choose.</p><p>The confusing part of the game was that in the first round, I did not plan for the risks and did not prepare for them, I only worked on coping/restoration once the damage was done. In the second round, I followed the comet/risks, I planned where and how to build, and then restored again. But the damage was exactly the same and so was the outcome of the game. This was very confusing and discouraging.</p>

<p>So, overall, I feel the game was setting participants to
fail because (a) there was no specific goal or background explanation for what
we are trying to achieve with the game, (b) the research of meteorite was highly
inaccurate and there was not other research available (i.e., what places are
usually hit by the comet and what is the average damage), and (c) there was no
explanation as to which measures are going to guarantee protection – level 1
upgrades, level 2 upgrades or any other upgrades.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the game was lacking structure and
essential information about the situation and the risks to make any thoughtful
decisions and salvage the situation.</p>
