    <div class="field-value">This reflection emphasizes the importance of risk management and captures elements of the experience of role-playing a risk manager. Highlighting the trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection, insurance and how did you alter their contribution to managing the risk as you played additional rounds would potentially improve the reflection. It would also benefit from more clarity and several corrections regarding the terminology. </div>
