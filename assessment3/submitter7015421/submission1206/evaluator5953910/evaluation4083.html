    <div class="field-value">This reflection did a great job relating the game to the key terms and concepts being learned in the course, describing how knowledge, protection and insurance in the game related to risk management practices. It also effectively explained how the risk management decisions were affected by extent of the threat that was posed by the comet.

The reflection could be improved by providing a clearer explanation for the last question, as it was a bit confusing at first; but it is a really good idea to add a component of the game that is randomized to represent how the state is influenced by the need to retain political support.</div>
