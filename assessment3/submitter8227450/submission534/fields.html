    <h1>Submission 534 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8227450, session_user_id: 351f115ef566a1d4ec1ecd04a196667c4acdec5d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"> Risk Horizon is a very nice game
which combines entertainment and knowledge together. It help me apply the
knowledge acquired in chapter 1 and 2 to achieve the right balance between
preparation components of risk management :

<p>·       
Knowledge (or research in the game)</p>

<p>·       
Protection </p>

<p>·       
Insurance</p>

<p>to insure the creation of a healthy
community that face comets effectively.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>      Definitely,
risk management played a key role in the development of the community; first preventing
the damage created by the comets via the protection methods (research and the raise
of the island) , secondly by recovering the damage created by comets via
insurance policy ( low repair cost …),  finally
by unleashing the opportunity of growing the community which is the main
objective of the game (by preventing comets and their damages plus  upgrading the pods  ,the meter will be filled faster) </p>

<p>       In my
short experience in the game I focused more on investing on research and
protection rather than insurance because I seem they were more effective,  but that don’t mean that insurance don’t have
any benefit at all .So I confirm that risk management affect the development of
the community positively , and its  result appeared after some time.</p>

<p>       After
playing this game I learned many things about risk management .The most
important thing was Balance, thus to attain the goal of a well developed
community we should find the right combination among : resources, insurance,
research ,protection and time. So without this combination you can’t win the
game. Secondly , I learned that  risk
management is indispensable and vital for the community to face any risk
(natural hazards, financial crisis,…. ) .Finally I thought  the creation of community connections played
a secondary role ,but I soon realized that has an important and cost-effective
role .</p>

<p>       If I were
the programmer of the game, I would added one change.  I make more emphasis on the coping mechanism,
so when a comet hits the community I should obtain a list of option that
contain who should take the first initiative confronting that risk based on the
severity of the comet , for instance if the comet wasn’t severe and hit a
specific pod (idiosyncratic risk) , individuals or household actions will be
more effective and fast. In other hand if the comet produces a large damages (systemic
risk) , the sate should take the initiative because it can handle a large disaster
more effectively.  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>       Finally
the game shed light on some aspects of risk management , which help students to
better understand the important effect of risk management in our life .Thus I encourage  the creation of such games in the educational
process because it make the material taught more realistic . </p>
