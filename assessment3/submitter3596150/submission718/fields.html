    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. On this game risk management was the key issue, if you didn't do it right, your villages could be destroyed. At first I tried to develop the villages as much as I could, but as they developed, it was more and more expensive, so I tried to make it more even, and develop all of them level by level at the same time. I found out with this game, that one of the most important things were the connections after an asteroid hit. Thanks to making them "quick", I could avoid damage, almost in every time. I hired always an insurance at the beginning of every level, but as I didn't have much money, only the 50% or less. But again, with the good connections after a hit, there was never damage to repair. I also kept a good level of protection 6/7, or higher if the asteroid coming had a higher level of menace. While the villages were developing I always kept a look at the sky for new threats, and always as soon as an asteroid appeared I looked at its characteristics and tryed to make as much research I could on those with higher possibility of hitting the planet. I also noticed that from level 4 (more or less) reaching the goal was harder. Development took longer, was more expensive. I reached a point that I didn't know what else could I do. <br /><br />2. I played the game twice. The first time I reached level 5, but the second time to level 4. As I wrote earlier, since level 4 I noticed that it was much harder to achieve the goal of risk management and development. The second time I tried not to build so many villages at once, but I think it was not a good strategy as I didn't do better. What I learnt from this game is the importance of the conections after a hit, but also the preparation before it. <br /><br />3. As I also mentioned earlier I could do the "connections" after a hit quite quickly, so I always got no damage. I don't think that is true in real life. No matter how well you are prepared in real life, after a "disaster" there are always damages, of course how big those damages are, depend on how well you managed the risk. I didn't get the sense of much "danger" in this game, maybe I was really good prepared! But then, why didn't I reached the last level? I think I would change a bit on how much damage an asteroid makes, and make them more dangerous. <br /><br /></div>
