    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. the role of risk management in the game is to mitigate loss and produce prosperity using tools like research, protection and insurance. the trade-off i made was to insure my pods in case there will be shock with high degree of severity. preparation for risk help to reduce the extent of loss thereby making humans to use their limited resources toward development and re-furbishing.<br /><br />2. if i were to play the game again, i will pay more attention on research and picking the appropriate insurance package so as to avoid huge loss.<br /><br />3. the money aspect and time is what i will look into if i were to re-modify the game<br /></div>
