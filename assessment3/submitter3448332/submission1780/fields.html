    <h1>Submission 1780 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3448332, session_user_id: f2219b71624ff8d9f860bb939ea771cfa9604e10)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">My reflections on the Risk Horizon Game.<br /><br />The role of Risk Management in the game had to do with the combination of building pods, providing insurance and protection and having knowledge about the different risks (meteorites). The choices I made had to do with balancing knowledge, protection and insurance; for example, if the risk was low, I could choose to build more pods and invest moderately in insurance and protection, but of the risk was high, I could build less pods and invest more on insurance and protection. To determine the number of risks it was necessary to do some research for the meteorites in order to gain knowledge in this matter. Preparation for risk affected development in the sense that it made coping for disaster more effective; that is more immediate.<br /><br />If I only played the game once, I would not have gotten the sense of the whole game so I would probably would not know how to play it correctly; therefore the probabilities of playing it successfully would have been very low.On the other hand, when playing the game several times, you learn from your previous mistakes and try different techniques to solve the problem more efficiently. The main things I learned from the game were how to balance between all the different components when managing risk: knowledge, insurance and protection.<br /><br />If I were to change something about the game it would be the fact that it is hard to understand</div>
