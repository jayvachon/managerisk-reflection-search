    <h1>Submission 58 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6963969, session_user_id: 2affc9d371170fc94bb926b7bbaaeb6874089f99)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game Risk Horizon the setting is somewhere in the galaxy
on a undeveloped planet. Your role is to build habitations while the underlying
risk of a meteor hitting the planet is always present. In order to continue
developing the planet one must incorporate risk management by utilizing insurance,
meteor research, and land elevation to deter the financial impact of the meteor
impacts. By purchasing insurance the total financial impact of the meteors is
offset by a percentage based on the level of insurance, however, this sacrifices
available capital for development. By researching the meteor you learn about
the severity and likelihood it will hit the planet, but you spend time that
could be used otherwise. By raising the elevation of the land you lessen the
severity of the impact, but you use money and time that could be used on
development.</p>

<p>While playing the game multiple times I realized that applying
the risk management techniques too little or too much would adversely affect my
success while progressing through the game. If I applied no insurance I would
be forced to pay for the entire cost of repair if a meteor stuck the planet.
However, if I applied the greatest amount of insurance then I would not have
enough money to develop fast enough for the time restriction. Eventually I
realized that applying the lowest level of insurance and about half of the land
elevation while doing a reasonable amount of research on all of the meteors
would allow enough time, money, and security to continue development in order
to reach the next level.</p>

<p>As I donâ€™t live on a distant planet where meteors are
continuously falling in my back yard, a different style of game may better fit
the place I live. If I were able to redesign the game in order to better fit
the place I lived I would incorporate financial stability and risk involving
the monetary balance of the player. There would be scenarios which a financial crisis
would decrease your wealth balance and this could be mitigated with hedging or
diversification strategy.</p>
