    <h1>Submission 566 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2406359, session_user_id: 42dab7cd2eb5d859ad1b70be5f158744fb63672b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First of all, I
want to tell you that I played the game for two days just to reach the level 4,
and it was hard, not addictive though. I think the role of risk management in
the game was very important that you couldn't even reach your development goals
(means you couldn't reach the next level) if your risk management is not
effective. You need to balance the use of all the resources that you have, the
research (knowledge/ information), protection and insurance, and also time and
money are important, you've got only a limited time and money that you can use you
to reach your development goal or comets hit your pods.</p>

<p><span>In terms of decision-making and trade-offs, I made a strategy and wrote down everything in
every level. How many pods should I build and how many should I upgrade, and
how high and strong my protection should be in each level, because the severity
and chances of hit of comets are totally 
different from each other. I actually didn't use insurance in most of
the level, especially when my protection is high, but if the severity of the
comet is higher that my protection, I immediately purchase an insurance. I kept
some money also for the next level, I don’t use the whole money for one level
only, because of that I don’t have to wait to build a new pods or upgrade the
old ones in a new level, and if I reach the development goal before the time, I
use the whole remaining time to increase my protection as far as I can. I
noticed that if you increase your protection during the game, your development
goal is moving very slow, that's why I always increase my protection either at
beginning or end of the game or before or after to reach my development goal.</span></p>

<p>If I played the
game only once, I would definitely change everything for the next game, its
just too hard to manage and balance the use of insurance, research and
protection, in addition to time and money for the first time. No one can pass
the first level for the first time I guess. And if I played the game more than
once, I definitely pass that by improving all the mistakes that I made from the
previous games, juts like what I did.</p>

<p>The main things
we learned from the game is that risk management is so hard for the first time
especially when you lack any resources. But by learning from the previous
mistakes that we made and having a specific goal to achieve, we actually
progress more and more and reduce the damage that disasters produced from time
to time. And even though you've got the resources like information, insurance and
protection, if you don’t know how to balance the use of these, you still cannot
have an effective risk management, and the worst is that the current
disaster may be higher than the previous one if your risk management is not
effective.</p>

<p><span>I’m actually
not good in gaming, I maybe an Asian,
but I’m not a good gamer, that's why it took me two days to reach level four.
But if I have the chance to develop a game or that game about risk management,
I would make the game that is not just focus on developing the pods or
upgrading it for development goal, but also the welfare of individuals that are
living in that pods. And I would add more resources than just three, maybe the
use of technologies. That's all.</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you,</span></p></div>
