    <div class="field-value">KEY STRENGTH:
The text shows that you took the time to reflect on what this game taught you.  In particular, I liked the suggestion of taking volatile prices into account as it is not always given that the cost of construction (e.g., of pods) does not change over time --volatile prices are critical factors indeed as they might severely impact your overall risk management effort (e.g., by limiting your ability to cover insurance costs and implement adequate and timely protection-related activities).

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
Please make sure to edit your content better next time. Although the ideas you expressed are good (and some very good), the grammar still needs some improvement as it affects the fluidity and readability of your text. This is especially important if you are planning to write a text for your final project or a blog on risk management and other topics as well, in the near future</div>
