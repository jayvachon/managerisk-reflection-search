    <h1>Submission 1434 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8389418, session_user_id: eb8f29b64962d984743f0588a14a263b0d6949fa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management was central to the game. Because each of the different risk management techniques required resources, their use had to be traded against development gains. Each of the risk management techniques also had to be balanced, in terms of the time and resources needed to activate the protection. It was all too easy to get caught out with unprotected costs at the end of the stage, with little time to undertake repairs! The immediate affect on development was slower growth and upgrading. In the longterm, it allowed for progression to the next stage by protecting gains.<br /><br />I played the game more than once. As I played, I understood the role of research better. My approach become this: identify comet, get one or two research points, if it looks like a high risk comet then I continued to research while accumulating funds. I also increased insurance levels.Â <br /><br />I learned from the game the importance of planning ahead, and with information, developing a short term protection strategy and building up buffers to recover from the shock. I also learnt of the capriciousness of the disaster events. Sometimes, despite the best laid plans, your development goals can still be missed.<br /><br />The game has been developed with a single threat and a single measure of development. While this is a simple model of development, I think it would be interesting to add a second type of threat (helping to represent the complex nature of risks to development) or a range of development factors that need to be considered together in unison. For instance, education, health and wealth of the inhabitants of the community. <br />Perhaps the governance of the community could be an additional facet of the game? Different forms of governance could present new barriers, or make certain types of protection more effective. For instance, community support networks could be more effective where a strong civic sense has been created or where governance is responsive to citizens demands.</div>
