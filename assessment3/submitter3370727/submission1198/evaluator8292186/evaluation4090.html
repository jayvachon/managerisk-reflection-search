    <div class="field-value">The author is clearly knowledgeable about the concepts involved in risk management, as evidenced by his reflections. I liked how he described the technicalities of the game and connected it with the theories being studied in the course. I'm a bit confused about the author's suggestion on the game itself towards the end though, particularly the role of government in risk management. I know it's very important to consider it in real world scenarios, but I fail to see how it can be incorporated exactly in the game. The suggestion is quite interesting though, and I wish I understand the technicalities of game writing enough to be able to picture that addition in future versions.</div>
