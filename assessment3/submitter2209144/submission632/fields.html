    <h1>Submission 632 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2209144, session_user_id: 8648b6a80104ad5cc380539bf1f7cbca96af9c89)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game,
all elements of effective risk management were included. These are knowledge,
protection, insurance and coping. First, (after getting used to the settings of
the game) it was important to gain knowledge on both the risks and
opportunities. Risks were mainly reflected by the asteroids threatening damages
(in different magnitudes and with different probabilities of a hit), while
opportunities lay within the development of buildings. Second, one could
protect oneself against the asteroids by either building up “resistance”
and/or, third, buying insurances that covered different levels of damages and
repair costs. Lastly, when an asteroid hit, it was time for coping by
re-building infrastructure and protection, in part relying on the community. As
a player, I had to balance all my resources. For instance, it took a while to
obtain the resources necessary to buy insurance, whereas effects of protection
building were more imminent right away. Then again, some asteroids did not even
hit the planet or caused only limited damages.</p>

<p>At my first
try, I invested too much resources into both protection and especially
insurance – buying coverage of 75% in all levels. However, this resulted in
slow development of the buildings, which caused slow income growth. More over,
building protection hindered growth further. However, some of the risks did not
materialize, because some asteroids did not hit the planet or caused only
limited damages. Therefore, I could not reach higher levels. Thus, I had to
change strategies by only relying on low-coverage insurance in the first two
levels, while capacity building for protection and repairing was still fairly
cheap, and to step up insurance in later levels. This allowed for better growth
overall. </p>

<p><span>The game
was well-structured and captured elements of risk management in a great way.
Although I would have liked to see a more detailed tutorial, the main thing I
would change is another one. As we have learned in the second week, there are
several obstacles risk managers are usually facing. So although there is
appropriate knowledge, sometimes actors lack financial capacity or are hindered
by behaviour biases. Whereas the latter aspect is hard to properly implement in
a game, the lack of resources (and maybe even incentives) can be built in more
easily. For instance, next to the insurance option, there could be social and
political programs available to the player at certain prices. They could lower
the impact of an asteroid hit on some portion of “society”, say by lowering
costs for the rapid prop-up of buildings in an early development stage.</span></p></div>
