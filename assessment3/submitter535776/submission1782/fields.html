    <h1>Submission 1782 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 535776, session_user_id: 115265779eb4d03d2571513190da7313e687d2c2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) I definitely made trade-off during the game. When I was faced with risks with an higher severity and chance of hitting, I was more inclined to buy an insurance with an higher coverage and the other way around. When I was faced with the possibility of a hit that would cause great damage, I was more inclined to invest more money in protection and the other way around. Research definitely turned out to be useful in many cases.<br /><br />2) Playing the game once, I was inclined to take more risky decisions, as I was not sure yet what the effect of these decisions would be. The first time I played the game more with an trial and error approach than with a strategic plan. Once I played the game more often, I learned that sometimes it was better to take less risky decisions in order to progress further in the game. Therefore, I invested more money in protection, research and insurance in the latter times that I played the game. The second time that I played however, I was scared and took no risk at all. Playing the game more often allowed me to find a balance between taking risks versus taking no risks at all, making something similar to a cost-benefit analysis in my head (including the evaluation of chance of a hit, the severity of a hit, the effect that a hit would have, the cost and benefit of insurance, research and protection)<br /><br />3) In a new version of the game I would develop a function in which you are able to invest in research that allows you to optimize your protection methods. For example, investing an certain amount of time and money in research creates the opportunity to employ a new level of protection that would protect you more from a hot, leading to lesser damage. This creates a trade-off between investing in research and investing in insurance, as at some point research can become so advance that risk of the hit becomes irrelevant and insurance becomes unnecessary.</div>
