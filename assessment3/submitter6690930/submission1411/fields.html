    <h1>Submission 1411 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6690930, session_user_id: bdd87ff02b766303ed06abcf922b35c5fc02d0a0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of risk management is misrepresented in this game. I doesn't matter whether I buy top insurance or not, whether I raise the village level to the highest level. The game is designed in a way skewed towards knowledge. That is great in real life but when you track all of the comets and still don't get enough juice in the bottle by the game's end, it's extremely disappointing. That's despite having elevated your village to the 8th level above the ground and having maximum protection. There is the only trade-off in the game - you have to watch comets and while you are doing it you can't raise the level of the village higher. That's not what it is in real life. You can do both at the same time while here the interface of the game doesn't allow you that. I have plenty of money for insurance, but I don't have time for protection. When I increase protection I don't see whether it had any positive influence on the response and remedial work after the comet impact. So I can't really say how preparation affected development. All of the nice words about knowledge, protection dwarf in a game that's poorly designed.<br />2. I would change the following things:<br />a. make it possible to track and study stars while at the same time doing something else, e.g. raising the village level above the ground,<br />b. introduce more types of houses, otherwise it's boring<br />c. passing the level SHOULD NOT depend on the knowledge bottle on the left side. If your village survived, you pass!Â <br />3. Introducing a sneaky guy who comes and steals the money allocated for protection, insurance and knowledge in the form of corruption, embezzlement.</div>
