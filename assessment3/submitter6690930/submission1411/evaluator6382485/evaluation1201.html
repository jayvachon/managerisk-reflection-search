    <div class="field-value">The student has tried to master the game and understands the metaphorical connections between the game and real world risk management.  The student is at a disadvantage because he/she missed out on how to make connections within the pod community after a comet wipe-out.  I suspect this will be a common problem as the instructions for the game were dispersed and the process of making connections was not clearly spelled out in all of the various instructions.</div>
