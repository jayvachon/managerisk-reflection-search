    <div class="field-value">The key strenght of this reflection is reasonable allocation of costs. That is player primariry spent money on developing and on protection only if there was a real threat. These measures helped to spend less money on insurance and repairs. This was a great tactic, in my opinion. And 	suggestion of implement multiple building types isn't clearly enough. Is it means building for protection and building for development may be? It's interesting suggestion.</div>
