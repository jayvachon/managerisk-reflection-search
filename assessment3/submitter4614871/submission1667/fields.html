    <h1>Submission 1667 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4614871, session_user_id: 7470a1987d982f0b085d837c82cc3f59c540f470)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game clearly tells how to prepare for the risks and take teh necessary precautions when we know that shock is going to come. Initially i have taken teh max protection insurance ( no. 3) from the total sum provided to assure myself. Secondly, i had made teh developments but simultaneously raised teh height from the sea level to haveÂ the minimum impact of teh comets, which really did worked. I keep raising the level to the max from the total sum. Preparation for teh risk ofcourse affect development as in teh same money we need to spend for teh risk by stopping the developments. <br /><br />I played the game many times,and each time i have learnt for a better risk management. We learned from teh experiences. Each time i had learned a better risk management idea that can hep me in teh development with min risk. First time i havnt raised it to teh sea level, but after subsequent play when i raised it above teh sea level , it helped me with a better risk management with lesser harm. So, i taken the insurance in the first place, raised teh land above teh sea level in teh second place and develop the city in teh third phase, so that to save it from the max harm.<br /><br />I would like to have an option to choose a place to build the city where it will have the minimum affect of the comets. Developing some kind of boundaries to resist teh wave affects.</div>
