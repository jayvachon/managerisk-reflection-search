    <h1>Submission 2225 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8176816, session_user_id: 5853fe086b14d4b4f255e1a1d120ba6a83c1d8bd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The role of risk management was to show how balancing gaining
knowledge through research and spending time on getting good data (about the
severity, chance of impact) could help investors make informed decisions on how
to balance achievement of goals with investing in strategies such as protecting
the project and buying insurance.  </span></p>

<p><span>In the first few attempts at the game, lack of knowledge was
the main constraint as well as lack of confidence.  Both made me too overly cautious as I was too
away of the risk of the meteor at the expense of achieving the target of
building the community.  I tended to
spend too much time and money in ensuring protection and buying insurance,
leaving too little resource ( both money and time) to achieve the target</span></p>

<p><span>I played the game several times, and as I got more knowledge
through experience with the game, my confidence grew in terms of managing the
balance between protection and building the houses.  I learnt to build houses faster in between
increasing protection, and also not overprotecting based on the chance of
meteor hitting.  At the beginning I
always bought the maximum insurance and towards the end, again as confidence
grew I chose the middle insurance level and used protection so I could build
faster. </span></p>

<p><span>The main things learned was the need to balance among knowledge
of the risk, timing of investment and protecting the investment.  The large difference in the cost of repair
with insurance also showed that I could take more risk with insurance.</span></p>

<p><span>I found it difficult to understand how the minigame after
the meteor struck represented community connection and how that made achieving
the goal easier.  I feel that the
instructions about that needs to be clearer or perhaps the timing should come
before the strike rather than after or perhaps both.</span></p></div>
