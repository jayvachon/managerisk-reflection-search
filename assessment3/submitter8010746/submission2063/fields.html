    <h1>Submission 2063 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8010746, session_user_id: f01acd52c40b40c0c1e283689364c3c82ccb6927)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk
management role in this game was elaborated in many parts of the game’s
techniques. First, it was in the offered insurance plans to reduce the cost of
fixing the damaged pods in case of a negative shock. Also, the option to collect
information about the comets along with the connection in the community that
are made after each hit represented another image of risk management. </p>

<p>Knowledge was
represented in the information collected for research on each comet. While
protection was offered in different options such as the insurance that
represented the protection of spending a large amount of money in case a
disaster hit, the level of height of the area which also lower the degree of
damage, and the research were made to reduce the probability of being hit by a
comet and its level of severity. Finally, the different insurance plans
represent the insurance element that is one of the effective risk management.
Moreover, preparing for risk in advance helped in dealing more effectively with
risks and negative shocks, which are main obstacles for development. It helped
the development both immediately and after some time. Immediately was shown in
how the community connections after the shock have worked together to prevent negative
consequences. On the other hand, after some time was represented in collecting
information for research about comets that helped after time to better
understand the pattern of comets and how to reduce their probability of
occurring, and the degree of how severe is the effect.</p>

<p>I have played
the game more than once; therefore, what I did differently was focusing in
developing the society while paying attention to the different risks facing the
community. The main things I learned from the game are priorities what risk to
deal with based on what has the highest probability of happening first. I also
learned the importance of post shock procedures such as insurance, and
community connections. </p>

<p>If I were to
develop a new version of the game I would choose to add a feature of paying
attention to the location of the pods. In Saudi Arabia, my home country, the
locations of houses play a strong role in the possibility of facing destruction
in case of floods. In addition, I would also add the factor of “corruption” as
a risk, which is also another important factor effecting development in my
country and many developing countries as well. </p></div>
