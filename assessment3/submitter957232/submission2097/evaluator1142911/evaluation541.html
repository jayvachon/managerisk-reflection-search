    <div class="field-value">It is not a mistake of author, but rather a consequence of this game, that most people consider insurance as something what has to be included in risk management. BUT - there is difference between insurance and insurance. In risk management you need to identify risks and buy relevant insurance to these risks. In reality there is a lot of people who buy insurance against theft due to its lower price than insurance against natural disaster. This I name as mistake in risk management. So strenght is to know that insurance can protect us against certain risks and make reflection better requires to match the expected risks with right insurance. Most insurance companies enable no protection against unexpected risks because they are not statistically calculated.Question:How much of people in the world are insured against the comet strike with earth?                         </div>
