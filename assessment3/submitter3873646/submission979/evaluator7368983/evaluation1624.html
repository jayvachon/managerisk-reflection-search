    <div class="field-value">The key strength is spotting the use of methods and tools of risk management that other students recognized during the game.
Knowing the goals and methods of risk management and recognition of others 'mistakes is part of the copy that can help us to learn from others' mistakes and anticipate possible risks and the experience of others in solving certain problems.
1. Very well described the preparation for the game and associated risk management tools.
2. Error observed in other attempts to copy the games used to eliminate the potential risks that would lead to destruction.
3. More clearly describe own example and proposal games, maybe the example of their own local communities and specific examples.</div>
