    <div class="field-value">The strong key from this reflection is the suggestions to improve the game (part 3). I liked the way the student eplained way of thinking and implementing different tactics in the game to achieve success. To make this reflection better I would add a little bit more about the role of Risk Management in the game, however, I like the reflection the way it is. Thank you for describing your thoughts while playing. They reminded me of my thoughts: not unerstanding, not finding interesting the game, but trying and trying more an more to achieve success... :)  </div>
