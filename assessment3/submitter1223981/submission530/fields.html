    <h1>Submission 530 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1223981, session_user_id: f8eff0e299e435ed52ef70860a1938778dc3bff8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I have really enjoyed playing the many perspectives presented in the game. Personally I found some of the richest strategies are:
1.-keep your network healthy:  A healthy network is recognized way to find support in high risk environments and keep you without damage. Individuals cannot act alone. It is compulsive  concerted support and action from surrounding social and economic systems. The build of this network cannot be realized  without strong institutions and policies that focus on the long run.
2 Knowledge and Continuous research helps: as the meteor goes down, and with several metheors and allows to distinguish between different risk levels
3.- When the hit occurs, management activities or risk coping thanks to the insurance network.
4 Knowledge allows prioritization: allows to Identify the types of obstacles that often impair risk management and prioritize.
5 Recognize actions and reforms that can improve risk management and reduce the obstacles to it.

Failing to follow simple preventive measures like take care when a hit is going to happend, to difficulties in mobilizing the  community to engage effectively in fragile states—  are obstacles and constraints that stand in the way of responsible and effective risk management.

I often underutilize this knowledge: significant progress in risk analysis, from better forecasting to more experience and knowledge about what happens when a hit occur retrofeed my actitude to new events.

If you don't have the rightincentives,the rightinformation, or if you have behavioral issues,then it might be useless or even counterproductive to justlook atthe resource only. And that'swhy in this series of assessments ofthe obstacles, we suggest that the assessment ofthe resource issues arrives last.

Uncertainty is a fundamental issue with risk management, and it needs to be confronted and accepted and dealt with, not disregarded, even
though it might be a difficult thing to do.

Policy action: two principles to keep in mind when designing risk management strategies. 
The first one isto be realistic, and in cases where some simple solutions can work, even though these solutions might not be the optimal ones, maybe simplicity issomething that we should follow. That is especially the case in low capacity and low‐income governments where very sophisticated policies or tools might be very difficultto implement and practice.
The second principle isto build foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficultto design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will
react and how the contextwill change.
Implement basic policiest hat focus on what's most important, like setting  the right incentives for people to manage the risk well or making the information available, and to make sure the policies are revised overtime regularly to correct, overtime, when more information is available or when we observe that some policies might have some negative side consequences.

The impact ofthese shocks can be amplified orreduced depending on people's external environment,their internal conditions, and whatrisk management is in place. There can also be important feedback effects overtime. So,for example,the outcomes of pastshocks may affect the propensity for future shocks. I'll use an example to help illustrate some of these concepts.

I think this  game is useful, particularly in how it shows how risk management can be central to the transmission of shocks and the impact that they have. The question then is: Is thaht way how does effective risk management look like?

Effective risk management needs to combine capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards. 
Preparation includes knowledge, getting information on risk, but then using that information to make judgments, obtaining protection,
measures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, or obtaining insurance, measures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times.</div>
