    <h1>Submission 182 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2068024, session_user_id: 5fcce0129763242b220c83cc10292db7e12c2c29)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">To get more pods developed.<br />Only focused on meteors and went on building/protecting. Insurance efficacy cannot be assessed..<br />after some time.<br /><br />I won't play it again<br />I won't play it again.<br />(1) Do not waste time.(2) Digital games hazardous to mental health (3) gaming mentality hampers development<br /><br />This is a wrong game to teach risk management as it is heavily biased for speed than for strategy. There are many beautiful games in economics and finance on internet. The attitude and counting in this game are completely irrelevant (and childish), though content (aka rules and set-up) appears in line. I would rather design a game  like .those in economics and finance. <br /><br />In the  place I live in, poor work hard to keep rich in their palaces. The myth called taxation never works until &gt; 50% is spent on people (That's what they do in Gulf, USA and Northwest Europe. Communists did it without taxation.). So, prime factor is resources which is pathetically held least important  by faculty of this course.<br /></div>
