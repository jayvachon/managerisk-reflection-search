    <h1>Submission 1164 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5068595, session_user_id: 1d0a55cbab6b498ddb22cec653d8bb794cd7f578)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects
of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the
game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you
propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the
place you live?</p>

<p>The role of risk management in the game was to learn
how combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the ability to cope once a
risk has materialized. </p>

<p>I decided to buy insurance and invest in protection
before to start the constructions influence the likelihood and magnitude of the
weather risk. I also tried to get knowledge gathering information and making judgments
about the weather, but was not so successful in that item.</p>

<p>I noted the preparation for risk affect development
only after some time.</p>

<p>I played the game 10 times but I was not able to go
over level 3. I tried the combination between research, insurance and protection in different
ways but I do not think I got the right decisions. My conclusion is that I was not good in preparing for
the risk.</p>

<p>I do not know what changes would be better to
represent risk management choices that matter in the place I live because I
live in a big city. Maybe clarify the investiment in protection as I did not understand
which level would be adequated.</p></div>
