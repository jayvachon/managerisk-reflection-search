    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Reflection about Risk Horizon (game)</p>

<p><span>It was only a game but made clear the
importance of the Risk Management idea. In the game you have one task,
reach  a level of development in a period
of time, obviously with the risk of being hit by a waves provoked for the
impact of meteorites, and to stand up you need spend resources to protect your
imaginary city instead of spend that resources in improve it, there where the
dilemma was.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know if someone beat the level six, in
my case, after multiple number of tries, couldn’t complete the last level.
Maybe it was of those games in which you can’t win to understand de lesson (if
someone conquer the game tell me). After multiples failures in the last level, I
comprehend is better spend your in resources in protection against the waves
instead of the pursuing of the maximum level of development because in the long
run it was cheaper than if we don’t do the spending. Of Corse you don´t achieve
the maximum development with this strategy but at least your city has not
finished in ruins, like my tries were I spend more in development than in
insurance, protection and research, in those cases I finish event in levels
previous of progress because my city was so vulnerable to disaster. </p>

<p>Respect to what I aggregate to the game, I think
in put a neighboring town or in the opposite side of the sea who can help you
in hard moments and you can help when they are danger, to have a better understanding
of the international cooperation.</p>

<p>To the question can the things learned from the
videos, material and game improve the situation where I live? The answer is a
totally yes.</p>

<p><span>I live in Mexico, a place where is spend a big
among of money putting up what disasters take down, like the state of Tabasco
or Acapulco harbor, for mention some recent examples, where the total amount of
money to repair and rebuild exceeded the amount expended in prevention and
infrastructure to have a good response to the tempest.<span> <a>[1]</a></span></span></p>

<p>Only in mi city, Mexico City, a big proportion
of resources go to repair public works that had a poor planning and execution
in different part of the project or the whole project, like our ways and subway
new line. The same problem occurs in the private sector and the inefficient
regulations in construction in our city. In recent times we have a big number
of tremors that show the negligence around the topic and the exposure or lives because
bad practices in the construction code.</p>

<p>The risk management can improve greatly my country,
but is not like our authorities don’t have knowledge of the problem and
possible solutions. We have a very grave internal problem, my country, <span>like many other,</span> suffer for the corruption and
incompetence of the majority of the individuals <span>who form part </span>of our governance structure. </p>

vale prevenir... que arreglar daños millonarios” to have one idea of the measure
of the spending in Mexico.
