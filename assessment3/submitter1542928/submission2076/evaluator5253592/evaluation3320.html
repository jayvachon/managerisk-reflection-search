    <div class="field-value">I believe the key strength of this reflection is that the student realized that combining the tools and resources that he had, he could improve the welfare of the community facing in a better way the different risk involved in the game.
The thing that I think it would make this reflection better is that the student said that he “realized that it was not important to research the comets with low probability of impact” I believe that the real risk which the community should care is the weight of the probability of happening the risk and the impact of it, not just one of those.
