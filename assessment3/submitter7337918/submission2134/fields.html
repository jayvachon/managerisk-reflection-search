    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Basically this game is very interesting. Interesting because there are many things we can learn together. I really like this game. This game makes me more and more to like about management risk and want to learn how to create an opportunity into success. Management of risk in this game has a very important role. We can make a priority that can be done when idle to face disruption or disaster. Of the three elements that can be used, namely knowledge, protection, and insurance I could make a priority to minimize the negative impact of the disaster. The first time I did was make a purchase insurance. Why purchase insurance? It is very clear that when the disaster came, to fix everything needed funds. If there are things that can be covered by insurance, it would be useful to reduce the cost at the time of repair. Then protection. It is also important to be able to minimize that when a disaster or disruption coming, the negative effects can be minimized. Even its exposure to the public that there are, in this form of protection is to reduce the negative effects that appear not to eliminate the negative impact. And the protection afforded should be is the best protection, so that people there can be a safe, quiet and alert when the catastrophe came. </span><span>I played this game a few times. which is different in each game is a strategy that I do to try to get the best results. The best results in question is how to reduce the negative impact of the disaster. and eating six pieces I managed to reduce the negative impact of the disaster. Maybe at first I did trial and error to get the best possible way so that the best results can be obtained, which is to minimize the impact negetif. I need some time in order to get the results I want. When we can get the best way, we can perform a standard operating procedure so that when disaster came, we've been able to act in accordance with what will happen next. Whether it is a difficult thing? It must be hard, we may now talking at the level of the game. But when it's there and it actually happens will be very difficult. But no matter what happens we must be ready. I forgot about the research. research is also an important thing that must be done. With the research we will be able to gauge what will happen and how to best response.</span> <span>When compared with the state of current reality, especially with the situation that I experienced in Jakarta. Maybe if I was given the opportunity to provide input to the games we play, I want to add a feature there is the death toll from the disaster-affected or the disorder. In addition I also mlihat that these games can be made if we become governor where there will be a number of casualties, so that the governor's reputation as a person who plays the game can become a better feel for the situation that occurs when the disaster came. When a game can be made more complicated maybe we can get a lot insght that we can get about the risks and opportunities when disaster strikes.</span> <span>please note it is a disaster in my country are common. Almost in every year in Jakarta always get flooded. I feel concern for jakarta if the rains come. Therefore I always prepare mentally and logistical preparation if the floods come to jakarta. I have to do is buy a lot of instant noodles, took the money in the bank, and move goods to higher ground<span>.</span></span><br /></div>
