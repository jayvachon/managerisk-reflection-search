    <h1>Submission 1221 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8435899, session_user_id: e7d3a1e93bbfe9ed5d17b6c7e1c5f030f6944517)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>Question 1</b><br /><p>The role of risk management in the game is to provide a practical example
of how decisions positively or negatively affect development. The game starts at a primitive level of development. Without any prior knowledge the player makes poor decisions (e.g., no focus on protection measures) but quickly learns from his/her mistakes. Development is slow until the player focuses on building up a knowledge base of the risks and consequences. From here s/he can begin to take adequate protection measures. At low levels of development, only basic protection measures were required to minimise risks. This was better value than insurance or doing nothing. Capital resources could then be allocated to speed up development and undertake further research to improve living standards. However, at moderate to high levels of development additional protection (i.e., insurance) was required. At this level, basic protection measures were inadequate to fully protect against the steep financial losses from damage to expensive buildings.</p>

<p><b>Question 2</b></p><p>The game encourages learning by doing. It forces the player to make decisions and trade-offs under imperfect conditions - much like the real world! In the beginning the player is frustrated, has no knowledge, is unable to take adequate protection measures, and partially relies on luck to advance. The focus in the beginning is on insurance. This is a poor use of financial capital since the risks are unknown so significant damage still regularly occurs. However, after several attempts at the game the player's knowledge builds and the risks and consequences become known. Now the player can determine what level of protection is required to mitigate the major risks so society can develop at a more rapid pace. <br /></p><p>

</p><p>The game's major lesson is that wealth creation largely depends on decision making. Since income is limited in the beginning, basic protection will minimise losses from low impact events. This maximises the capital available for research and further development, which generates more wealth and higher living standards. As the knowledge base increases, research efforts should concentrate on higher impact events. As society's wealth increases further, capital can be allocated to higher protection measures and insurance based on more sophisticated research findings.</p>

<p><b>Question 3</b><br /></p><p>It is unclear whether the game considers research findings when developing stronger protection
measures. Does the game recognise that protections (such as building codes) change over time as new findings arise? For example, in 1974,
70% of Darwin’s homes were destroyed by Cyclone Tracy (category 4) and new building codes for cyclone vulnerable areas of Australia were adopted. Cyclone Yasi (category 5) in 2011 showed that more pre-1985 homes were damaged
compared to homes built to recent standards. This type of information would be useful in the game to make insurance level trade-offs.</p>

<p>However, if I could add one thing to the game, it would be the impact of technological advances on decision making. Taking the cyclone example again, windows are still a weak spot and a leading cause of building damage. Cyclone resistant glass is a relatively new product but has a higher cost than traditional glass. It is not yet legislated in the building code so people have a choice whether to use it depending on their risk appetite and income levels. At a simple level, this product represents a step change from previous levels of protection. Over time it should lead to insurance savings as less building damage would be expected to occur. It also demonstrates the importance of research. This product would not be available without adequate research into the effects of cyclones, which highlighted weak spots, and provided incentives to solve the problem.</p></div>
