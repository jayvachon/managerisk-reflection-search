    <h1>Submission 2144 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1985394, session_user_id: 8a0c8db2ea830eca235196d77487eabb2b3400cc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management played an essential role during the game. Knowledge was applied when the comets features were studied, every time I observed a comet I could see where I should invest more, per example, If the probability of a comets to hit my planet was almost zero, I did not invest heavy in protection even if the comets could cause a severe damage. By lifting my community and investing in their pods were a way to protect them against possibles damages. In addition, buying an insurance helped my to recover my community fast. </p><p>I could think
about several alternatives that I should do to prevent a catastrophe in my
small community. Time and money were the main constraints. I often had to manage
my time either by getting more knowledge ( observing the comets passing by) or
investing in protection. I also have to invest wisely; It was not necessary to
use all money to protect my village or to buy the best insurance. In fact, I
did not buy the best insurance  or reach the best level of protection. A
good protection and investments in structure were enough to prevent and cope most damages.   </p><p>I
played the game more than once. In the first time, I invested a lot in
protection. My first thought was " if I protect my population they will be
safer and happier." However, it worked on the opposite direction; my
population was not happy at all, and I ended up failing. In the second try, I
firstly bought an insurance, invested a little in protection ( up to four bars
in the firsts levels) and invested hard in the pods. This strategy gave me time
to invest in knowledge, and I could pass to the next levels easily.     </p><p><span>I really
loved the game; it was my first contact with risk management after reading the
material of the course. I would include some interaction with the population,
and they could indicate clearer where to go. For example, in a situation which
in you think you have to invest in insurance, the population could give their
opinion before you buy it. If they feel that the current levels of protection
and knowledge were enough to cope possible damages, a window could pop up
telling " we should not spend our money in insurance, otherwise your
popularity will drop sharply."Then if a severe damage hits the community
they would not be too sad as they participated of the decision. it could make
possible to share the responsibility of the risk management.</span></p></div>
