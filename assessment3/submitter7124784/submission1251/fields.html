    <h1>Submission 1251 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7124784, session_user_id: d6f5e4f45c47b269051bb86ecde1049a08ba701d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management allows one to take a better position to face future uncertainties. This may be due to experience of such occurrences. I decided to first of all build but with with a lot of care. secondly to undertake projects according to standards or
expert advice and finally insure against any unforeseen event. Preparation for risk pt me in a better position to confront the risk. This helped by building a tower around buildings. Even though the understanding was not too clear in the game i realized
later on that it was all about managing risk by applying a number of options available either from the beginning or in the middle of your life. I would probably work hard to earn more and build very robust building capable of withstanding such eventualities
as in the example with buildings in Chile and also go for insurance If am tasked with developing a new version i would probably think of adding migration to a less prone area after earning some marks and also some different means of migration either by
road, water, rail or by air</div>
