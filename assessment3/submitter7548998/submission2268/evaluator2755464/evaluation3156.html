    <div class="field-value">One key strength of the reflection is the student's ability to recall some strategies that can help mitigate risk.The student mentioned protection,insurance,preparation, and coping.However, I had difficulties understanding what the student was saying.One thing that would have made this reflection better is clarity.If they were not clear to me,I guess they may not be clear to other students or instructors as well.</div>
