    <h1>Submission 902 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7422596, session_user_id: 0b81a0dee4c8e4556f567957c1c375ae72322680)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Reflections</strong> :<br />Overall the game was a nice way to learn about managing risk and its outcome.The game is easy and simple to use (if you have played other strategy and risk type games e.g. command &amp; conquer).<br /><strong><br />Answer 1:</strong><br />The game identifies the threat arising from comets hitting the waters near your community and causing damage to it.Asses the comets probability of hitting the water and prioritize the risk arising from each comet.In response use the resources available at your will to minimize or avert disaster.<br />In level one my focus was on development of community and its protection,five comets hit and one missed.The level of protection saved me from all five.Knowledge was obtained and insurance was foregone.<br />In level two after getting hit by comet I quickly got the insurance saved the repair cost for the pods and the focused more on protection and less on knowledge.<br />In level Three my choice selection was insurance and knowledge.Protection was foregone.<br /><br />Protection slows down the development,it immediately turns the bar from green to red.Insurance takes out the fund needed for development (low on cash) and knowledge takes the limited amount of time we have.(while focusing on the comet you cant do anything else).<br /> <br /><strong>Answer 2:</strong><br />I would apply same strategy for level 1 as I applied in the first try,but would fill the protection bars till top. In level 2 I would take knowledge and Insurance,hope that protection from first level keeps the damage at minimum.If I reach level 3 then my attention would shift to keep all the resources being utilized in the limited time I have.<br />The lesson I learned is that you must to complete everything within a time frame.Exceed that limit and you will suffer the consequences.<br />Similarly if you don't react to the risk in appropriate time,outcome of not responding in time will affect not only you but the also those who are linked to it.<br />The other thing is you must effectively utilize the resources at your disposal.<br /><br /><strong>Answers 3 :<br /></strong>The addition would be to have help from not only from insurance ,but option to get international Aid at the time before and after disaster( not only in monetary terms but in terms of sending organisational help in form of experts who tackle disaster prone area). This form of help can be the factor which can restart the life,bring the affected communities back on track,start the development in quick/efficient manner.  <br /></div>
