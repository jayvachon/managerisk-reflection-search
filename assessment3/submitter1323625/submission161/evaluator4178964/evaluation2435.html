    <div class="field-value">1. What is the key strength of this reflection?
R/ I agree that the key ideas of this reflection is in the approach of the protection components and insurance. 

I agree with the statement about the importance of preparing for the risk "(...) Preparation for the risk of affecting development in the short term (...)" protection but also reduces the likelihood of impact losses and can achieve increasing profits in the medium / long term.

2. What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
R/ From the ideas presented, think about the important complement component knowledge: "(...) In short, you can not protect 100% of the risks in real life." Right. However research process not only focuses on data collection, it is also important to address the processes of knowledge to assess the degree of exposure to possible disturbances.</div>
