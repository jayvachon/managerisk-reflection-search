    <h1>Submission 831 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7724307, session_user_id: 9c45e21bbb9373e10fa8c87c8bd4ecd1c9be1f58)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>The role of risk management in the Risk Horizon game was
extremely crucial. The game taught players how to balance the responsibility of
developing the town while protecting it against risk, which in this
case were comets. The game included all of the main components and key points
that were discussed in the video lectures, such as obtaining knowledge by
monitoring the comets, increasing protection by raising the town and minimizing
damage, and buying insurance when there is adequate wealth to prepare for disaster.
These were all very important to the survival in the game and moving on to the next
level. </p>

<p>While playing the game there were definitely trade-offs
and risky decisions made. For example, the player had to monitor the speed and
the likeliness of the comets making contact with the planet. The comet research
and pod development takes time and it definitely forced the player to manage
the time clock efficiently while trying to balance the two tasks. In addition,
there were trade-offs with the amount of wealth the town had. The player had to
decide between using the money to upgrade pods and reaching the development
goal or upgrading the insurance package to protect it from comets. The
preparation for risk took more time and a larger sum of money, which sometimes
affected the amount of development that could have been completed. This taught
the player to accumulate and save money when possible, so it can be used when a
risk does occur. </p>

<p><span>I played the game once and to my dismay I only reached up
to level 5 out of 6.  If I were to play
it again, the first step I would have taken would be to raise the town
immediately to level 3 and start the pod developments right away. The raised
town is a good prevention method while the pods are being developed. While
development is occurring, the player is allowed to do research on the comets
and take even more preventative measures. I believe this would have been more
effective if I played the game once more. If this were to happen in real life,
institutions and the government of the country would learn from this experience
and hopefully improve their risk management for the future. </span></p>

<p>If I were tasked with developing a new version of the
game, I would add the addition of coping strategies besides the use of money to
repair damages. If the planet were larger, I would include evacuation plans and
encourage the player to create their own and update evacuation plans based on
the damage caused by the comets. Similar to how the insurance plan would have
to be renewed each level, the coping strategies would also have to be updated. This was a
great game because it taught players on a basic level how risk management is
important to development. The game gave me anxiety because I had to think
quickly on my feet, which is exactly how real life should be as well.
Developers and locals need to implement preventative measures as well as react
quickly when risk occurs. </p>

<p>I currently live in Washington D.C. and I would propose to
change where and how energy is being obtained. If our energy could be switched
to sustainable solar or wind power it would make this great city more resilient
to the future of climate change and severe weather conditions that have been
occurring all over the world. These events will only continue happening, and
one of the first steps would be to change where we obtain our energy source. </p>
