    <div class="field-value">The student I am evaluating seems like understood all the concepts clearly and playing the game well, although it seems to me that the essay was mainly focused on describing the game rather than showing a reflection on how that could be brought into reality, especially in the country he/she lives in.  I think is important that knowledge is applied to the different contexts.

If I may suggest something is that next time you should rather focus on writing a full body text instead of limiting yourself to answer 3 questions made by the MOOC, Since I did the same process I understand is difficult, but I also discovered is challenging to put all of your ideas into 600 words, it gives a nice reward of putting it all together, in your own terms and creating your own concepts afterwards, so it will be more clear.
