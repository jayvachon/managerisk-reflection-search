    <h1>Submission 2538 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5364335, session_user_id: 70a8c919643a9a07112831efd9a3333fc1875466)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Horizon aims to teach the multi-faceted and concerted actions required to mitigate risk and realize opportunities that might be available for success. I played the game twice and there were different strategies that were adopted. In my first attempt, the main aim was to build the communities as quickly as possible. I thought that having more communities would help in agility, cooperation and sharing of resources when comets struck the planet. But at the same time, I bought the insurance that offered the least protection, because the first comet that came near had a low probability of hitting. But the strategy back-fired in the second level of the game because I had spread my resources too thin by starting too many cells and had to incur high damage costs for each of the communities because of low insurance. This caused the failure to move from Level 2 to Level 3. While developmental activity was on, the damages caused the future potential of development because significant resources were spent on repairs and damages and the threat of another comet ruining the new developmental activities did not encourage any new developments. As a result the Level 2 failure could be blamed on inadequate planning, preparations for comet strikes and spreading the resources too thin. The second attempt involved ploughing back the learning from the first attempt. This time, the game was played with a phase-wise expansion of communities and taking the highest insurance available. Also, the elevation option was exercised, which had been ignored in the earlier attempt. All this helped in crossing the second level, but the third level again caused problems to the developmental activities. Also, the comets were regularly monitored to check for the probability of strike and preparations were made accordingly. 
The main learning from the game were that insurance would help mitigate the damage that is caused because of risks that are uncertain and are beyond the control. The lower damage costs would save the resources that could be exploited for better opportunities. Apart from this, proper planning and preparedness helps build resilience, which otherwise could cause chaos. Communities that can share resources and cooperate have an edge at surviving calamities. 
In the game, it was observed that the comets struck at the same intervals and at the same intensity when the game was played twice. If given a task to recreate the game, I would design it in a manner that would make the sequence and the intensity of the comets striking a random event, so that the uncertainty in the game can be maintained.
