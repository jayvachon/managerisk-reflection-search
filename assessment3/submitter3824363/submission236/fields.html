    <h1>Submission 236 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3824363, session_user_id: c9ff65ebeebe6171bdfd849b31b01bf6dc9fee60)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.<br />To be honest at first when I started, I started without doing the tutorial because normally I like to find out things my own way. But after a few tries and never reaching further than level 2 I did the tutorial to find out what I was missing. So after the tutorial I found out about the lifting, comet monitoring and the green puddles after a comet hit the planet. With this knowledge I switched my strategy from buying insurance towards lifting the place and clicking the green puddles. Additionally when a very destructive comet was nearing I bought precautionally some insurance.<br />Compared to my first rounds before the tutorial with just using insurance I became much more comfortable after the tutorial with my lifting and clicking strategy. Depending on the comet I lifted the place and combined with clicking the green puddles I then often ended up with no damage. So I would describe my last strategy as adaptation.<br /><br />2.<br />As can be seen from question 1 I played the game several times.<br />For me I would say that changing my strategy from insurance towards adaptation using lifting and clicking made me more comfortable as it gave me more flexibility and I do not had to buy insurance for high premiums but rather invest the money in lifting and upgrades.<br />For reality I would say that the game is a great introduction but in reality I would prefer much more insurance than I used in the game. The background is that I think reality is much less predictable than the comets in the game and so insurance gives people a good protection against unforeseeable risks like "black swans" by spreading risks over a huge amount of people leading to little costs for each individual. Of course local precautionary measures are also important.<br /><br />3.<br />Deducing from answer 2 I would integrate some external shocks/black swans that could hit the player without preannouncement.</div>
