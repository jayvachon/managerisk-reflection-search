    <h1>Submission 2273 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8234767, session_user_id: 29d9306521dc6b2bb921df236719987b3578b096)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game was an excellent demonstration of the trade-offs and inter-dependencies between the three components of risk management. I found that early preparation for risk allowed development to proceed more reliably in later levels.<br /><br />I tried to get development going mildly at first, then invest in protection and research, and then focus on development more aggressively.  I learnt that insurance was not worth the expense especially at higher levels of coverage. The game gave a clue at level 4 that protection expense has diminishing returns, which was helpful. The main thing I learnt from the game is the temptation of skimping on protection and research only to lead to the pain of seeing a lot of damage done by the comet.<br /><br />Instead of being a timed game, I would give more quantitative information on the trade-offs and allow for more time to make decisions before exposing the island to a series of continuous meteoric outcomes. This approach would better simulate how risk management proceeds in the real world. As a note to the educational component of the game, this change would also be helpful to allow the student to simulate more scenarios and understand the trade-offs faster. Currently after I lost a level, I had to go all the way back to build up from level 1 again. <br /><br /><br /></div>
