    <div class="field-value">Key strength: The introductory paragraph is a good account of the features of the game and how they are interlinked.
To improve: More time spent considering the aspects of the game that challenge you; I believed that the development bar froze during the building of protection because time (and money) invested in these things did not develop your community further until the protection work was completed (regardless of what level protection). I would say that perhaps a small jump in the level of development once a new protection bar was achieved would have been a good suggestion.</div>
