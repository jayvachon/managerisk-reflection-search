    <h1>Submission 385 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8278150, session_user_id: 9800b4bcf63e119258945f320cc81bc1625937b1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Final code: GvgvzSA<br /></p><p>In playing the game I was aware of the need
to find a balance between development (to ensure continuous income and reaching
the goals of the green bar on the left), protection (ensuring I raised the land
to meet the severity of incoming comets), and knowledge (researching only those
comets where the severity was very high and I lacked the time to protect myself
enough). I failed the games on several attempts because I would waste resources
on raising the level of my settlement to a level beyond what was realistically
needed – which then impacted on development because of the lack of time left. I
would draw on insurance as a last attempt when I realised that a high-severity
comet was coming too quickly for me to research and I was ill-prepared. <br /></p><p>The
community connections, when a meteor struck proved to be the most crucial factor
in boosting my protection against damage – it was often these community
connections that I relied on to carry me through the crisis. Preparation for
risk often hampered development in the short term, but it did ensure steady
development over time. It was far better to develop slowly, and prevent any
damages, than to develop quickly and spend half the game repairing. Doing
research instead of raising the levels of the settlement was a risk I took,
because the opportunity for increasing the amount of community connections
often tipped the balance in my favour – resulting in overall protection of the
settlement. <br /></p><p>I’m not sure what I would add to the game to change it. One option
could be to ‘evacuate’ in cases where the severity of the meteors was too high
to cope with. This would, however, cost time and money (resources), and result
in damages to the settlement. Although it’s not a great option within the
context of the game, in real life it’s often a choice which people SHOULD make,
but don’t (because they see the risks as far outweighing the benefits). <br /></p><p>Another
feature, which didn’t come across in the game, was retrofitting existing houses
– so those houses that are more developed, are better able to withstand shocks
and risks. In lower-intensity disasters, this can definitely protect the
houses. Disasters disproportionately impact on the urban poor – who lack the
appropriate housing, or are living in areas where building standards are not
monitored or enforced. This causes the highest damages in events such as
earthquakes. Developing buildings and critical infrastructure according to high
building standards, which are appropriate for the risks in that context, is an
added measure that cities and governments can take to protect their
communities. </p>
