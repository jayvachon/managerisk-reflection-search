</span>Without an effective risk management the game
can’t be progressed, as shocks produced by the comets deteriorate development. Throughout
the game you face tradeoffs between risk management and development. Naturally,
the more resources you spend on preparation and coping, the less you have left
for development. There are also tradeoffs between the risk management tools,
e.g. the higher your level of protection, the more severe comets you can absorb
without any damage made, eliminating the need for insurance. On the contrary,
if the protection level is lower, you need to purchase an insurance plan to
make coping cheaper and invest in research to minimize damage. Costs of the risk
management are apparent immediately often prior to an adverse event except of
post factum costs of coping with the shock. Upfront costs involve costs of
setting an adequate protection level, research and purchase of insurance plans.
Increased costs negatively affect the development, as less money is available
for construction and upgrades of pads. Benefits of effective risk management
are apparent only after shocks took place, e.g. high protection levels
eliminates damages from the comets with corresponding severity. For comets
where severity is higher than the protection level investment in research
lowers the damage through community connections and the purchase of insurance
plan significantly lowers the costs of coping leaving more money available for
future development.<span><br /><br />
2.
During my first go on the game I tried to use all of the risk management tools
to their full potential. Keeping protection levels high, investing in extensive
research and purchasing expensive insurance led to lower damages and cheap
coping. However, massive investments didn’t leave enough money for development
and I was not able to hit the development target after the second level. I then
decided to change my strategy and opt to set and adequate level of protection
(5) constant throughout the game. No further resources were spent on comets
with the severity level of 5 or less. When there were no comets with the
severity of more than five the money gained were invested in building and
upgrading pads, increasing development level. For comets with high severity and
high probability of hit an insurance plan with a high coverage was purchased.
Although expensive, it appeared to be cost effective when restoring the damaged
pads. High severity/high probability comets were researched to ensure that
after the shock there was enough time to minimize damages through community
connections. </span></p>

<p><span><br /><span>3. The
game aims to picture the world of Alora as a populated settlement. Assume that
each pod’s inhabitants have self interest in increasing individual protection
against shocks to save their lives/properties. Also assume that research
automatically translates into timely, comprehensive and widely available information
which can be used by individuals for making effective risk management decisions.
The research of comets then not only increases the time for community
connection, but also increases individual protection levels. This is also valid
for insurance, as more information about the loss is available; the more likely
individuals are to buy private insurance. We should add the global research
meter to the game, the level of which will increase with the time spent on
research of comets. When level on the meter raises to a certain point, individuals
have enough information and automatically buy private insurance lowering the
costs of coping and increase individual protection level leading to a higher overall
protection of the settlement without any additional investment made by the
state, i.e. player. Although this improvement incorporates individual
incentives in the game and makes it more realistic, it heavily relies on the
assumptions stated above.</span></span></p></div>
