    <h1>Submission 445 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5984047, session_user_id: 741db2152a2ae04c7c62cc74723cb460c4fbcc01)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to balance insurance, protection and research while also progressing forward with development without stagnating.  As there was and impending and unavoidable risk, I found it best to always purchase the highest level insurance in order to prepare for the worst. I would then build, upgrade and develop while alternating between researching meteors and raising the ground level for protection. My behavior was most risky for the first few seconds at the beginning of each round as I waited to accrue enough money to buy the best insurance, but this paid off as I was never hit during this time.<br /><br />I played the game multiple times as I wanted to achieve the highest possible level.  Each time I tweaked the balance between building, protection and research.  I found it best by the end to build as many structures as possible and then to upgrade equally each level, while owning the highest level of insurance and if time and budget allowed as I was nearing my development goal I would then raise the foundation as I found this more beneficial than researching individual meteors, which became my last priority or a filler task when waiting to accrue money.  I learned to balance impending risk v. expected risk v. unlikely risk and how to balance taking risks for future security and stability.<br /><br />I would add an aspect to where the land didn't just sink back down to sea level when hit but rather to sink below sea level gradually which could simulate added flood risks, earthquakes, sinkholes and negative results from Fracking.  I live in Texas where Fracking is very prevelent and just north of us it has now been linked to earthquakes in oklahoma.  This added aspect of the game would make it to where the  player has to utilized the "raise land feature" where as before one can progress through the game without having to use this, it adds another risk factor but also makes necessary to use another tool of prevention to risk.</div>
