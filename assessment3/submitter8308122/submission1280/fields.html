    <h1>Submission 1280 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8308122, session_user_id: 4d732b43afc34ae2131d136cc0128fb9d706f593)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The game is excellently designed to allow us understand what is <strong>risk management</strong> and how should we cope with it in a situation. The game starts off with designing pods to help us carefully allocate them on the crater within the sufficient time given.  It the notifies us on the different type of craters which are going to hit the planet, their severity , their time and also their their capacity to to cause damage. A sufficient amount of money is always allocated to us so that we can efficiently manage them on a regular basis. frequent use of money notifies us that we need to use them adequately and appropriately as possible. Any lavish use of money will result in a notification popping up telling us there is a shortage of money at the earliest. we also need to keep a constant check on the time of the comet striking us, making necessity arrangement s in the meter provided and also frequent changes to our pods. the pods on the other hand need to be updated on a regular basis ranging from <strong>$178 to $422</strong>. frequent up gradation and timely monitoring helps us to adequately manage the game. Insurance packages are also provided on a different scales indicating a need for protection. <strong>A clear mindset, effective strategy and timely execution is all required for the game  to be successfully completed. with the comet arriving at different speeds</strong>, it indicates that uncertainties to vary on different scales and attack our projects at different points of time, Thus a clear strategy, a clear presence of mind and constant monitoring helps us achieve the goal in risk management.<br /><br /> 2. The game needs to be played on a regular basis and cannot be achieved in one shot, the game needs to be practiced quite often as well as needs a large amount of concentration from the player, as the money and risk are gambled on a large scale. Money needs to be adequate for timely setting up of pods, constant up gradation and also check on the meter to align the planet. Any change or sudden stop of money will result in loss to the player. The meter always needs to be green which is located on the left hand side of thee screen indicating a healthy growth if not will result in a loss to the planet. <br /><br />3. If i had to suggest a change in the game, i would like to include a <strong>comet destroyer</strong> which helps us to destroy the comet in the initial stages itself. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
