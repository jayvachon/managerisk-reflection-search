    <div class="field-value">What a well-written and thought-out reflection paper! Obviously the author has been analyzing the actions taken and decision made in the course of the game quite in depth. It also seems that the lessons learned were adequately applied to the author's own reality (presumably that of the US). The suggestion to attach specific costs to "R&D" activities (as part of new possible versions of the game) appeared to be a convincing one. In terms of possible areas of improvement, I would suggest to take your very good reflection points even further, leaving some rather more descriptive information out. Good luck with your final project and the successful completion of this course!</div>
