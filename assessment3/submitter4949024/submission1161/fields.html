    <h1>Submission 1161 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4949024, session_user_id: 27c4f4bef3a7a968e7861586d4f6ee9e663556bf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
role of risk management in the game was to mitigate the damage, both economic
and structural, caused by repeating disasters. In order to reach level four, I
had to choose between development/financial risks and rewards (such as investing
in building more pods to earn more income), as well as time management (whether
to spend time researching, and thereby offsetting the impact of the meteors, or
upgrading my pods), and insurance (such as buying the higher-priced insurance
to offset the costs of rebuilding). Preparation for risk affected development
in that it was impossible to focus on one aspect of the village, like
developing the pods or raising your village, as it would impede your level
progress and ultimately result in failing the level. Once the village had
developed somewhat, the increased income made the investment in insurance an
easy choice to make, thereby making the "advanced" village much
easier to repair after disaster. Though the simulation was a simple approach to
disaster risk management, there are great advantages in having income to spend
on disaster risk insurance and other preparations for recurring disasters.</p>

<p>On the second game, I
took much more risk than my first and very conservative approach. I focused on
1) building three pods with no upgrades in order to begin making money
immediately, 2) buying the second insurance option, which was less expensive,
3) raising my village only to about 30%. Not a single meteor hit during this
level, allowing me to take more financial risks. In the next level, I bought
medium-level insurance, focused on raising my village to protect against future
meteorites, and began upgrading all of my pods. I did not sustain any damage
during this level because of my protection. But I did discover that if I
invested too heavily in raising my village, I would lose the level. I changed
my approach on the next game, and was much more moderate in balancing building,
protection, insurance, and research.</p>

<p>However, the challenge
was not entirely based in finances. I also learned there was a considerable
amount of strategy and time management skill involved, particularly in
"researching" dangerous meteors. I think if I were tasked with making
one change to the game to better represent risk management choices in the
United States, I would make research an economic cost, and allow players to
devote a certain percentage of income to "R&amp;D," much as the U.S.
does in investing in emergency management and crisis response activities.</p></div>
