    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was building a civilization on a planet that was prone to strikes from comets. I did not use insurance because I wanted the risk of flooding to be near 0%. I constantly found myself trading time and money to elevate the buildings. I also found myself researching comets a lot so I had time to prevent flooding, but only on the more serious ones. Over time, my strategy eventually worked and I completed the game without any damage at all. If I would have not prepared for these risks in the way I did, I would have had constantly been flooded and would have never been able to complete the game with such success.<br /><br />When I first started the game, I was a bit confused about the concept of it. I really didn't understand what insurance did or what the button in the bottom right did except take my money. As I continued the game, I began a little bit of experimentation with mechanics of the game. It took me several times to finally figure out the optimal strategy. The strategy was to keep the elevation bar up 7 notches and research all comets that came close to passing it up or passed it up. This strategy worked with me until the end and allowed me to not only complete the game, but to absolutely perfect the game.<br /><br />If I could add or change one thing about the game, I would add "special" buildings. Instead of adding the default production building, perhaps a way of getting a comet defense system that can slow down comets. I would be upgraded in a similar way to the other building, except slightly more expensive and take slightly more time to make. During upgrading time, it would be deemed completely useless until the upgrade is fully made. The maximum level it could go up to is the same maximum level of production buildings. This would only slow down one comet, so it would not be too overpowered. The speed it would slow it down is -10% of the base speed for every level it was upgraded to. This would better represent risk management because it would better help players learn how to prioritize risks and manage the priority risk. My addition to the game would be a good choice to add to the game to help better teach risk management.</div>
