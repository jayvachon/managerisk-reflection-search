    <h1>Submission 51 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8167216, session_user_id: 3aee0323f944f1e9d9d2b9385173481f713ac118)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>

</p><p>The
game was a way to compare and select actions to prevent future damage and
losses. Between the available possibilities, the player should evaluate which
actions are immediately necessary, or if an action, e.g. lifting the island,
can be seen as a future investment.</p><p>

</p><p>Playing
the game more times gives also the right feeling to weigh better the actions.
Sometime an expensive insurance that cover the 75% of damage is not necessary,
and a cheaper insurance can be used saving money that can be used for other
investments.</p><p>

</p><p>The
main things that I learned in the game are: the time play a key role and always
we must understand when an action has the major effect; moreover there is
always a trade-off between the possible actions, and quite often putting the
maximum effort, or resources, to one single action (e.g. insurance) may not be
the optimum solution in a long period view, we always must look for a good
coordination among the actions.</p><p>

</p><p>In
the real life a good research and preparation can almost reduce to very low
level the impact of a foreseeable event, and I would emphasize more this aspect
a new game.</p><p><span>
