    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Dear friends,</p>

<p>I am really worried about the risk-horizon game. I couldn’t
suspect World Bank could use a way of evaluation where some people, like me,
have serious problems to reach. But not because cognitive problems. I have had
a lot of technical problems because: internet navegator, broad of internet line
and similar others. At the end, it takes me more than 20 hours to get an useful
version of the game, not because of software, but because hardware problems.</p>

<p>Concerning the game logic, I think it shows the difficult
balance governors and authorities have to do. It is necessary to grow, to get
an economical development, but monitoring risks. Have can we monitor risk? The
riskhorizon game give us four tools: research –scientific research to know
magnitud of risk and its consequecenes, always in probabilities words-,
protection –where nobody knows how much protection is needed, but where
prudential principle is recommended-, insurance –that is needed to buy it in
the market- and a special kind of solidarity, that can emerge from the links
between pods.</p>

<p>Every one of these tools drive to a social system. Research
to the scientific system, with their own logic. The game shows us the
importance of research and so the cost of research. The cost of a scientific system
could be very high and its results are so sure as so difficult to see. </p>

<p>Protection belongs to the political system. Specially
infrestructure policies of protection that emerge from the status. The traditional
or modern state is the institution created by societies to reach some common
protection. More, we can say protection is the basement of modern state, as is
outlined by authors as Thomas Hobbes.</p>

<p>Insurance is in the market system. It is a investiment to
cover the problems in the future. I have to say that this World Bank course
remarks the importance of the market throughout the importance of insurance.
World Bank wants to teach us that the market is the solution. At least, it is
the solution when problems came. But, can the market to solve the problems
consequences of big catastrophes, as broad famines, earhquarkes or similar events? I think that
market alone can’t. It is needed the state protection. Insurance is important,
but not enough.</p>

<p>And
solidarity is the last. Then we talk about social tissue. Then we talk about
society system as it is described by authors as German sociologist Luhmann. The
all game is a society metaphore, but it is not easy to think that links between
pods could be interpreted as solidarity. I believe in solidarity as an important
tools when misfortunes arrive. Solidarity transform people in actors, in
citizens.</p>

<p>But the game
is designed from the responsible authorities. The player have to believe it can
manage every resources: research, protection, insurance and solidarity. Of
course, you learn the necessity of every tool, and specially the necessity of a
balance between them because those resource require money, work and time. A
community –or a country- could have time. Likely work, if it has a formed
population. But what about the money? In the game, money is there. It is on the
left hand of the screen. But what does it happen in real life?</p>

<p><span> I spite of my (personal) problems of accesibility, I enjoy the logic of the game. A recommendation to next editions: please to think in people with very limited devices or with old and slow computers is required. An institution as World Bank, very concerned to people in underdeveloped countries have to think in those problems, that are very different of comprehension problems.</span></p></div>
