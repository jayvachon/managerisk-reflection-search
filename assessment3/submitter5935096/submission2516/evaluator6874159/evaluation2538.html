    <div class="field-value">In each paragraph, the student showed that he has a clear knowledge about the risk management; however, because he could not play the game due his problems he did not answer the question that were asked. So the reflection that the student gave it is quite confused. 

I think if the student had not any problem with his slow computer, he would have done a great job with this assignment.
