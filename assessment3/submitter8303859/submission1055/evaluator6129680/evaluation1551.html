    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the incorporation of knowledge, protection, insurance and coping when describing the strategies of moving along to each level if the game. The reflection would have been better with more consideration of a concrete aspect of risk management as a recommendation. Instead, the reflector suggested a small aspect of the game design itself, as opposed to incorporating other aspects that would lend to learning risk management through gaming.</div>
