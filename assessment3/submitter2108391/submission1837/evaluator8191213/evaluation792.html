    <div class="field-value">This person clearly understands the importance of risk management.  However, I feel that they didn't truly attempt to apply a lot of the knowledge obtained through the reading material to their attempts at this game.  There also seems to be a lot of redundant material in their reflection.  There's no doubt that this person is sold on the importance of risk management, but I would say try taking a little bit more time to apply what you've learned to the game itself to obtain more appreciation for the lessons being taught.</div>
