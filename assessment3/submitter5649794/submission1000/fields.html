    <h1>Submission 1000 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5649794, session_user_id: a73d74be282d9ef11552f029caaed088997821ae)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>First of
all, it is an amazing interesting way to represent the elements of risk
management through pleasant environment. The main idea of the game is based on
the two essential objectives of Risk Management which are produce resilience by
preventing disasters to be out of control and achieving prosperity by
continuing in construction process. So the role of risk management is clearly
covered through making the player confront risks of both hitting the village
and bankruptcy. I made lots of choices while playing the game but the most
important choices are when several risks appear in space. In such cases I
primary rely on research measure to build a base knowledge about the most influential
risk and the most urgent one to provide the appropriate protection. However, I
preferred preparing for risk by protection more than depending on insurance in
order to use money in invest the limited time by build more pods as long as I
have enough protection which allows the village to face dangerous risks. But I
used the insurance in case there was not enough time to prepare. Although benefits
of preparation are not always immediately evident but they appeared after few
time in this game because of the limited time an also the high degree of
certainty and the percentage of the potentially risk. Fortunately we have
enough resources to cover costs of preparation in contrast of some developing
countries.</p>

<p>If I
played the game only once it would be difficult to know how to conduct.
However, it's took me several time to learn what to do. When I played more than
one time I was able to spend less in insurance and I progressed better and
faster in building new pods and upgrading them. And I learned how to save time
by operating construction before turning on researching process. One of the
main things I learned from the game is to prioritize risks according to its
power, influence, and optional. Another thing I learned is to evaluate alternatives
and plans basing on information and knowledge to compare between spend on
protection or insurance as a certain primary.</p>

<p>Couple of
suggestion is to develop the game. The first is to diversity risks to other
kinds such as dirigibles which want to invade the village and in opposite
another kind of protection like spending on defensive, this idea simulates the
risks of wars that threaten countries around the world. The second one is also
has dirigibles but it may carry a modern technology of building in very low
cost, this idea simulates the opportunities that may able to gain.</p>
