    <div class="field-value">He/She has been able to clearly explain risk management technique to be deployed when a natural calamity occurs. While he/she has been able to identify the balance between risk management techniques, there was innovation missing in the reflection. Rather than adding on the game, the point for "multi-player gaming" was being proposed. While this is true that collective action helps averting risk, this was no innovation to be proposed and could be easily thought of. I feel that he/she could have proposed how "incentives, behaviour and resources" (factors affecting your decisions regarding risk management, with the factor of information already been covered in the game) when added to the game alters your risk management strategy of knowledge, protection and insurance. This would have been interesting to notice in the game with all the factors coming in that can affect your risk management techniques.</div>
