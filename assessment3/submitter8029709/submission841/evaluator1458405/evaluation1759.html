    <div class="field-value">The main point of the student's reflection is the proposal he/she makes in the end. In fact, it is well known that knowledge can effectively avoid damage and increase prosperity. In the place I live this is an issue that no government managed to solve because it is truly a community mismatch.
Overall, the student's reflection was accurate and easy to follow. Therefore, I would like to congratulate him / her for his/her good work. </div>
