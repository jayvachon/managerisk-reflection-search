    <h1>Submission 1086 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7166997, session_user_id: b14b984161e8b65f186ca0255c7b8e873d801580)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game for several times, until I succeeded the round four. It is not that easy as I thought at the beginning. It is a combination of strategy (risk management), and luck , just as in the real life.<br />Resource is limited, as always, limited time, limited budget, danger is constant hanging around. In order to survive, one should have himself good prepared and protected. <br />I started the game without reading the instruction, as a result I lose very quickly. With no knowledge, protection and insurance I could not expect more. After I learned all the tricks, which are, getting closer watch to each star, knowing its intense and possibility (knowledge); constructing the city (protection); buying insurance. All three thicks enhance the chance of survive, but all of them consume the limited resource: constructing the city needs a lot of time, so that you will be short of time for the buildings and for watching the stars; buying insurance is so expensive and gets more expensive in higher round that you have to wait for long to save the money, waiting eats up your time. That is a good trade off among these tricks. Sometimes luck play another important role. Even if you got good prepared and insured, the star can hit much heavier than your research showed; even worse, it hits after you finished some really expensive buildings, remember that insurance pays you no more than 70% lost.Â <br />From the view of game design, it is almost perfect: simple to understand but covers all important concept of risk management. Technique seen, it can run quicker, especially calculating damage could be quicker.</div>
