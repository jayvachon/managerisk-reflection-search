    <h1>Submission 508 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6109758, session_user_id: 08617cc1e29a28ee74f25f62ceba5f21eb8b1cd8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">     Risk management plays a key role in the Risk Horizon game in terms of the progressing of development while trying to balance the threat of the shocks (comets). While it was not cheap, I always purchased the highest level of insurance because I figured that it would pay off in case Alora was hit by a severe comet. When my planet was hit by a comet, it was very cheap to repair my community. Research was always essential when deciding on how to handle the protection of Alora when a comet was inching it's way closer to my planet. I always matched the severity of the incoming comet with the amount that my planet was raised, and that strategy was successful in keeping damage to a minimum. While trying to research and protect my community, I was also continuously working to develop the land I was provided with. Preparation for risk affected development immediately as the insurance cost took a toll out of my budget as well as spending time researching and working to protect my community.<br />     The first time I played the game, I struggled because I spent more time trying to develop and didn't focus enough on protecting the community by providing a good insurance policy for the community and not using the research to know how much to raise the land. The second time I played the game I was able to balance everything together. While it slowed development slightly, my community was not affected nearly as much from water damage because of my protection plan and better usage of research. I learned how to effectively develop my community at a slower pace with less risk involved. I also learned how to manage the constant risk of water damage, due to the comets, by using time and my budget to fund protection. <br />     I personally think that the game offers a good simulation of a scenario where risk management is needed. The only thing that I think that I would change is to make it possible to do more things while researching and gaining knowledge on the comet, however I don't know if that would make the game much more realistic. It added a little bit of difficulty to the game when I wasn't able to raise the village while conducting research on the incoming comet. Also, maybe a change in the scenario of the game would make it more realistic. A possible solution could be being stranded on an island and having to develop it even though it was constantly at risk for tsunami's or unbearable waves and the protection was building a levy and having to fund it.</div>
