    <h1>Submission 133 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1198564, session_user_id: c8cf280a6b7dfe89055b652d6ba1f1a714e24430)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is very fun and interesting. I played it a couple of times and came up to the third level, when i had more time id go the whole game. I think it is very instructive for our world because we have scarce resources, and money, and we need to deploy it on three basic things to try to prevent a catastrophe. As in the game, so it is in real life. It is interesting how research reduces potential catastrophe. Also insurance is also helpful, but i thing it is better to invest in more research to do to prevent a catastrophe. Also lifting platform is also in my opinion more useful than invest in insurance, because raising platform can prevent stroke. So i think it is best to invest in basic insurance, and invest in research and lifting platforms max as possible.<br /></div>
