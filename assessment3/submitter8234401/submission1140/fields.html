What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?

Risk management played a key element in being successful (scoring your goal) in this particular game. Having been given the hints of building and up-grading, I made the choice of continually improving the island.

Knowing that a meteor could strike at any time, there was plenty of incentive to both insure the property and improve the height of the land.

There is always an initial balance between spending for development, accumulating wealth versus insuring the property. However, when a disaster strikes, without insurance, along with the devastation of property,  also included is financial ruin.


If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?

The one thing I would do differently, would be to develop the property at a more accelerated rate.

The main points appeared to be to develop the property quickly and insure your property to the proper level.
The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?

I would not allow the player to change the elevation of their property, thereby putting more at risk during the disasters.
