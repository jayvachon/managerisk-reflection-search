    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection was the ability of the student to draw useful insights for their real world context from the oversimplified environment of the game. 

Their insight that the risk management strategy needs to evolve as the risk profile changes is also particularly useful.

Some more elaboration on the principles that informed the "efficient allocation of resources" would have added further to an excellent and insighful submission
