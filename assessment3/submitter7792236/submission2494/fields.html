    <h1>Submission 2494 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7792236, session_user_id: 4cfe09ef2727781b93c69ac68c457f472accc212)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I really liked the Risk Horizon game as it gave opportunity
to practice how risk should be managed. </p>

<p>During the game, I learnt couple
of things related to risk management. First thing I realized after playing the
game was about knowledge. When you have sound knowledge and planning about how
you should tackle a particular situation, you can excel it. I was in stress
before playing game. Therefore, I went through forums about how to play game
and tutorial of game. That really helped me to gain confidence. I ultimately
crossed level 4 and earned full marks. It can be related with risk management
too; if you are well prepared you can tackle shocks more easily. </p>

<p>Protection is another important
element to minimize effect of risk. If you have protected your community
enough, there is less chances of loss. In game, when I raised safety bar, there
was less chances of loss. Insurance, on the other hand, is another useful tool
which benefitted me to recover from shocks. Though, I saw about community
connections in tutorial, I didn’t get opportunity to use this. </p>

<p>Another thing, I learnt from game,
sky is the limit for preparation for risk. Whenever you play game, you get
chances to upgrade existing infrastructure. So, you have always option to upgrade
infrastructure. In addition, I learnt that you have to efficiently manage
available limited resources. </p></div>
