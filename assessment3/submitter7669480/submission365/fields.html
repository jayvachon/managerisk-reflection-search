    <h1>Submission 365 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7669480, session_user_id: 46f71148da58aaeebebd7ee1eadedd77806fa066)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal">The game was an effective tool to demonstrate risk
management elements.  The possible disasters caused by the comets, floods,
destruction of pods have to be mitigated at all cost in order to complete a
level successfully.  Initial trials made it very difficult for me, being a
newbie in Risk Horizon.  But after playing it for over 40 times (and I
only knew that I had to record the codes every after each game after my 20th),
trying to reach level 4, the level of challenge becomes more difficult.<br /><br />
All types of preparation had corresponding cost - either in monetary terms or
time delays in development.  Different scenarios were also tried -
building fewer but upgraded pods vs. building many less developed pods
vis-a-vis type of insurance to avail of and level of research and
protection.  Priorities for protection affect the level and rate of
development in Alora.  It suggested that life's choices are not that
easy.  You have to lose some to gain some.  It is not always a
win-win situation.<br /><br />
I did not really pay attention to the details of the game until I became so
frustrated about reaching level 4.  After failing to reach level 3, I
began to thoroughly read and understand the facts of the game.  This time,
I was able to maximize all features of the game and increased the frequency of
reaching level 3.  But then, I am unable to finish level 3 successfully!<br /><br />
I notice that putting more protection to my community slows down the rate of
development which makes it difficult for me to reach the kind of protection
against the risks pose by the comets and floods.  This is what I want to
change in the game so that there is more chance of reaching the next higher
level.  At the same time, while the rate of the comets becomes faster in
the next levels, the rate and type of protection must also increase with
corresponding price tag.<br /><br />
I learned from Risk Horizon the importance of research, communication and
appropriate information in order to properly and sufficiently prepare and
mitigate any adverse impacts of probable disasters.  As part of a
community, also demonstrated in the game, it is important to have several
neighbors (or pods) in order to have higher possibility of development. 
Building a community is very difficult, but the members of community and the
designer of such community make it possible for development to happen.  <br /><br />
In reality, we cannot redo our mistakes.  The way we face risks must be
carefully thought of and there is a high level of necessity to prepare for
disaster risks.  It is not a game that we can try several attempts to
experiment new ways of doing things.  With limited time and resources, we
as development specialist must learn, through research, from the different
cases in various parts of the world in order to have a better grasp on the
situation of the present and the future.</p>
