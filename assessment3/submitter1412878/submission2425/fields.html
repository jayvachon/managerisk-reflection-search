    <h1>Submission 2425 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1412878, session_user_id: e8f997bacb07540f51c9dc07e8dc1b274d6ea91b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Honestly, I found the game difficult to play. I couldn't go past level 2 because I just couldn't figure out how to proceed. I always bought full insurance. I realized raining the land wasn't much help so I stopped doing it. The knowledge of the coming comets wasn't much helpful to me since I couldn't do much about it except buy insurance nod be ready to rebuild. I tried to build quickly or to conserve funds for rebuilding. Neither of which helped me. It was an interesting game but sadly, I couldn't get the hNg of what combination of actions was required to get to the higher levels. I played it bout 12 times.<br /><br />What I would change we're to provide better information. What are the cost benefits of building each pod, the marginal benefits of adding no her pod and benefits of the different levels of pods. This would allow you arrive at an optimum number of pods to build. Actually, the bar to the right was not a very useful indictor as it could only tell you if you were losing or winning. We needed more detailed info to understand what factors might likely cuse us to win or lose.<br /><br />the only way I could doge risk was by taking insurance. Knowledge of comets devastation wasn't very helpful as I could not calculate its cost on my holdings to judge how or when to invest or not. It was only helpful to know when to buy insurance.<br /><br />i look forward to learning how others figured out this game.</div>
