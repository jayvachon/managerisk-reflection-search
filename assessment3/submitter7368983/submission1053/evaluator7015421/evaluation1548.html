    <div class="field-value">It is clear that the learner understood the key points of the course and understood how the game related to those points. Although the English was unclear in some parts, I gave full marks for clarity since it is clear that English was not the first language.  To improve the reflection, I think more attention should have been given to the final question - one (1) change in the game to make it more representative should have been included rather than a rewrite of the game. Secondly, I think a deeper evaluation of how the strategies relate to real decisions about risk management would have been better.</div>
