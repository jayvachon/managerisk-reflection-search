    <h1>Submission 2476 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6932006, session_user_id: 4c8497b506eceae6c9a8c473edd7d891d65da46d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This is a very informative and interesting game in the sense that inorder to complete my task in the given time inspite of coming across multiple obstacles like comets in this scenario, I had to strike a complete balance between all the three activities. I have to keep on planting pods, I have to buy insurance and I also have to make my village strike proof. This not only involves time management but also resource management. <br />Choices and Tradeoffs:<br />1. I have to keep on planting my pods so that I will not left without pods before the time expires. <br />2.I have to keep track of the severity of the commets and ensure my village can sustain them by providing protection.<br />3.I insured my village using the minimal insurance available as i already provided protection to my pods. This way, I am able to manage resources.<br /><br />I attempted this game multiple times and I was not successful the first time. Some times, I was providing a lot of protection. So I was not left with enough resources to create my village. The other time, I was just planting the pods, which didnt leave me an opportunity for disaster recovery. I realised the importance of insurance and balance. The third time i attempted, I could strike a balance between all these activities due to which I completed the game successfully.<br /><br />Along with protection and insurance, I would like to incorporate a growth mechanism using which I can be scored against the number of pods that I am able to plant in addition to the minimum required ones. This gives me a chance to understand how much extra i could have performed under the same given scenarios.</div>
