    <div class="field-value">This reflection acticulate clearly the learning derive from the game. There is an established relationship between the objects used in the game and the concepts of risk management.Also, the format of the refelction made it easier to comprehend the thoughts within it. The reflection could have been more insightful if there are lesser narration related to what happened in the game. The characters used in narrating what happened in the game can be used by expressing more the learnings and insights obtained from the game. Although the pattern of experience (in the game)-learnings-application as a way of conveying reflection made it easier for me to understand it easily.This is helpful for those who don't have actually played the game that would evaluate this. Since the evaluator has an actual experience in the game, the narration of the game process can be reduced and more insights may be added.

Thanks!</div>
