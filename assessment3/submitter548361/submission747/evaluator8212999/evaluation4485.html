    <div class="field-value">This reflection has a great degree of clarity and analysis, the writer clearly spent a good amount of time playing Risk Horizon and managed to see the challenges and constraints that managing risk would entail.The writer stated in a detailed way his or her experience when addressing the challenges of whether build for expansion or hold off for research and protection. Perhaps explaining more the intended change on the game to reflect the risk management choices in the area where the writer lives would have been an added benefit.</div>
