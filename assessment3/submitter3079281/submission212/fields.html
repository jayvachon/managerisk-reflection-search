    <h1>Submission 212 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3079281, session_user_id: 1e3f02f4287e069971e881f090d4882acffcb99a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>Question 1: What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?<br /><br />Answer 1: </span>The role of risk management in the
game was to prepare for the losses due to risk of comet and meteor hitting, to
make use of insurance intelligently to minimize the damages, and to invest in
adequate research. For low chances of hit and low severity, I invested more in
research. For high chances of hit, or high severity, I tried to invest in
moderate insurance. For both high chances of hit and high severity, I invested
in buying highest insurance. When, I bought highest insurance protection, the
redevelopment costs were low in the event of a comet or meteor strike.<br /><br /><span>Question 2: If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?<br /></span><br /><p>Answer 2: Given that I played the game more
than once, my main learning from the game was:</p>

<p><span>1.   
</span>Investment in insurance helps in
managing the damages due to risk.</p>

<p><span>2.   
</span>Community protection helps in
minimizing the losses due to risks.</p><p>3.   Adequate investment in research helps in correctly evaluating the chances of risk event happening.</p><p>Question 3: The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?<br /></p><p>Answer 3: I would want to enable a feature that allows decision making
on the basis of changing risk-aversion of an individual: whether low, moderate
or high risk aversion depending on the severity and chances of hit. </p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><br /></div>
