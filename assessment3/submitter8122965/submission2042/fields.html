    <h1>Submission 2042 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8122965, session_user_id: 9a34ea6343214ac51acdfc3171119b8500bb97df)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk Horizon illustrated that there are always trade-offs
when managing risk.  When you choose to
develop the community, you are forgoing protection and knowledge because you
are expending your resources on development. 
While you are informing yourself, you are forgoing development.  Additionally, you have to expend resources on
repairing the community after a disaster, which takes away from knowledge about
and protection from future disasters. 
While making all of these considerations, it is necessary to always
consider the costs associated with a desired benefit. </p><p>If I played the game again, I would have developed more pods
early on and would have spent less time and resources upgrading the existing
community.  I think that having a larger
quantity of basic pods rather than few upgraded pods allows you to have a
larger impact. Additionally, I would spend more time and resources on research
as I could have avoided some initial damage to my village if I had adequately prepared
myself.</p><p>






















</p><p>One characteristic of development that was missing was the
influence of policy and government. 
Policy is something that cannot be avoided in development, and it can
have both a positive and a negative impact on a community.  This would have added another element of
struggle and would have given a more accurate portrayal of the development
landscape.</p></div>
