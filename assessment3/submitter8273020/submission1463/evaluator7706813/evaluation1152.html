    <div class="field-value">From my point of view you did not follow any instructions. The reflection had to be between 400-600 words yours is 164, way behind the requirement. In adition to that you varely answered the questions that were given, your ideas are not well expressed and dont make sense. You didnt learn anything from the game more than the basic theory of risk, it looks like you are not even watching the videos. Sorry about the grades i gave you, but you have to take the course seriously, you are just searching for a certificate. </div>
