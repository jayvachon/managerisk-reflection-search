    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I need to admit that, I have difficulty understanding the risk horizon. Summoning courage to play again and again is frustrating and because I wanted to advance in this course, I have to attempt several times to reach level 2. There are many kinds of shocks ranging: flood, famine, drought, economic collapse or even relatively small household shocks like losing a job. From Risk horizon, I have discovered that to withstand shocks from this disasters insurance is very important. I have discovered from the risk horizon that insurance plans can cover part of the repair cost and damages caused by comet and replace replace one's lost development.<br />Development is affected, if one leaves a particular part of the land uninsured and the whole investment could be lost.<br />If I play the game several times, I will invest my energy in protection to be able to withstand shocks.<br />I would propose adequate education about different shocks to mitigate risk and to create opportunity through insurance.</div>
