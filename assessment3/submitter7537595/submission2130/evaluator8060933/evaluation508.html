    <div class="field-value">Fantastic reflection! the example of the glass was perfect for risk management and that alone shows how much is the importance of protection understood by the writer.Describing and explaining the events in the game and what steps were taken to react to those events shows that the writer put a very good effort into understanding the game.
This reflection lacks is talking more about researching and how important it is and how much it can affect the outcome when the communities are prepared to stand against a risk and they know what exactly they are up against. Finally, keep in mind this: while it is true that risk is a possibility of loss, never forget it is a possibility of gain! After all, what this course wants to teach us is that risks can be great opportunities just as they are great potential loses and learning how to control the risk effectively.</div>
