    <h1>Submission 2578 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5838785, session_user_id: 1b96babcd3445497431224ea1c1c4c6074feb11f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risks are around us every
day in the society; not only in our personal lives but in the company we work
for, projects we run, community we live and world/environment we are part of.
The awareness and skills to deal with these daily risks are key elements to
prevent them to become issues, when exploring negative risks, or to take
advantage of opportunities. The game was very nice to help us students to
understand that everything starts with information (as when analyzing the
meteor impact probability and damage), followed by preventive measures (elevate
the ground) and/or in insurance, especially when the preventive measures were
not enough. Development of the silos (units) was key to keep population happy
and producing, so the incentives also were key to progress in the game. This is
the same as in the live. In rural areas, government incentives will allow
people to take more risks and grow, while insurance and preventive measures can
prevent damage to the plantations. In urban areas, companies need to foresee
not only the events that would harm business, but allow employees to take risks
as opportunities for internal growth, and allow people to fail because without
that very few will want to adventure and take calculated risks.<span><br />
The
training so far is very good, and I am eager to start weeks 3 and 4!</span></p>
