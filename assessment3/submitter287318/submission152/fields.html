    <div class="field-value">The game vertical horizon provides a platform where the management of resources in risk is the core of the user activities; knowledge, protection and insurance are the skillls or tools that can be used to provide wealthness to the comunity, one remarkable aspect of this game is to provide or show what is a true risk?, it's just a combination of a tangible danger and a probability of happenning, in that way decisions have to be taken.<br />There's a balance between the skills provided in order to stablish a certain point of equilibrium, where the costs of risk managing are enough to suplement the risks but not too much, so letting invest in the development of the city, in the same way risks increase with the levels making decisions harder, at first knowledge seems to be not as important as we can think, but with the pass of time consequences increase and knowledge become a critical factor, at the first game you maybe don't invest to much in research but in a second time you will think twice; in the game it can be seen in the most possible direct way the importance of coping plans, and the consequences of not do it, fo a new version of the game it will be great to provide more realistic risks as sickness, poorness and others interesting aspects of a real comunnity as is shown in other kind of gammes as role games.<br /></div>
