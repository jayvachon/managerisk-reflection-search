    <h1>Submission 2311 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6972925, session_user_id: f9b4df6acd50eb07e38736e80f54c36fca11d22c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Although the game was not clear enough, it is completely obvious that it has a lot to do with risk management since one of the main things is to rise the level of the land in order to decrease the damage that a comet could do. My strategy was, first of all to take an insurance. This way was going to be easier for me because the development meter inmediately turned green, plus building the right way of pods. </p><p>AsI only played the game once, I would definitely change my strategy for a less risky one, for example; building first, almost inmediately taking up an insurance and only then to start upgrading pods. I should prove this strategy the next time I play the game.</p><p>The main thing I larned from the game, I think, is not to get desperate for the outcomes, since you strive yourself to make something possible, the only thing left is to wait and the results will be good. Another one important lessos is to observe and investigate the future causes of a hypothetical but quite possible catastrophe.</p><p>If I were asked to modify the game I will simply introduce avatars of people in order to create one more realistic variable and this way they may affect the development and outcomes of the game. Also I would introduce products to collect or harvest and create a micro economy within the game.</p><p><br /></p></div>
