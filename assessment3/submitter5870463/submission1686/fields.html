<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>It is risky to take risk sometimes;
riskier to take risk most times, but the riskiest thing to do is not to take
risk at all. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>As the <i>World Development Report (WDR) 2014</i> maintains, beyond risks are
often opportunities. Reaching those opportunities, however, will always require
confronting the risks that block one away from opportunities that lie beyond.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>Such is a scenario in the “Risk Horizon”
game. In the game lies an opportunity to develop an island community by
developing pods, and building a well-developed settlement. In the course of the
development work, there is systemic risk posed by “comets.” In order to proceed
with building this community, I had to put in place a mechanism for managing
the risk posed by falling comets.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>I had to decide how to properly manage
this risk. From the risk management framework presented in the WDR 2014; I
adopted the framework of using knowledge, protection, and insurance in order to
manage the risks posed by comets.  </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The role of risk management in the game
was to assist me proceed with development while managing the risks that I
faced. Through knowledge, I sought information on every single comet – its
severity, chances of hit, etc. This research was made in order to allow me
decide the level of protection I needed prior to each comet striking. With the
right protection, a strike of each comet left “no damage”, and I continued my
development work. With the proper insurance, I would easily recover from a
shock, by rebuilding damaged pods within a short period of time. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Risk management is a delicate process,
and must involve making choices along the development process. Throughout the
game, I had to make choices on whether I needed to seek knowledge, get insured,
or protect myself. Most often, I made a choice of seeking knowledge on each
comet before deciding on my level of protection. If, for instance, a comet’s
severity was well below by current level of protect, I would opt not to seek
additional protecting, as it would increase my protection cost. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I played the game more than once. What I
did differently during my succeeding plays was to invest more time into
research, in order to seek appropriate insurance and protection. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>My community is often threatened by
floods, and if I were to develop a new version of this game, I would change the
comets to floods that would destroy the community. By using a risk that is real
in my community, every member of the community playing the game will appreciate
the importance of risk management.   </span></p>
