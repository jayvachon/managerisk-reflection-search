    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">From this exercise I have a few take away points.  Aside from the fact that I don't have the reflexes to play a video game anymore, I felt that balance was key.  Trying to move quickly, manage resources, and conduct research at the same time was challenging.  <br /><br />Move quickly:<br /><br />In this game you have to move quickly and keep trying new things until you understood what the "real game" was.  Building networks and initiating repair without delay helped.  Matching the researched risk to the protection level seemed to help but it had to be done before it was too late.<br /><br />Manage resources:<br /><br />Buying too much insurance too early did not help.  Raising the ground too early did not help either.  If I focused on any one thing, the other aspects of the game fell apart.  The risk here was to take the early opportunity to build and then improve a few pods so that the income would increase.  From there I was able to make further protection and mitgation adjustments.<br /><br />Conduct research:<br /><br />As was noted in one of the videos, I down played the comets with lower risk to save some time.  A few of those came back to cause a lot of damage.  Once I gave every coment more than a cursory analysis, I learned that the calculations were not always useful.  I treated this as an area of deep uncertainty as described in the report (page 18).  <br /><br />And maybe weak reflexes were not match for the game.  If I had a team of "Players" this might have been an easier task.  Maybe that was one of the points.  I don't think you can do risk management by yourself.  A diverse team with differing views can help prepare the best possible course of action until more information and / or resources come along.  <br /><br />Thanks for reviewing my reflection comments.  <br /><br /></div>
