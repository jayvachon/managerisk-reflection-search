    <div class="field-value">Excellent job describing the many tasks faced by the player at once.  There are many moving parts in the game that you discuss perceptively while tying in principles from the course.  Also, very good job reflecting on what you would do differently the next time you played the game.

I would have liked to hear a discussion of how you arrived at a winning strategy to the game.  Did you do better the second time through trial and error?  Or did you calculate that you should prioritize time spent on research, for example?

Overall, excellent reflection.</div>
