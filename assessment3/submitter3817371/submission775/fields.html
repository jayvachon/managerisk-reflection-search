    <h1>Submission 775 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3817371, session_user_id: d944946268794f8a290b5c8410e7396a16cc7935)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. The Risk Management in this game is showing
that you cannot develop your world successfully without an understanding a
risk, protecting from risk and coping with risk results. So the choices were
the following, what to choose: to pay money for the development or to spend
some for protection of for the insurance. Also you have to understand risks
Probability and Impact to choose right level of protection and insurance. Also
it was important to establish links between communities in order to avoid
severe risk impacts. Preparation for risk I impacts development in the sense
that development is less fast but on the other hand your investments in the
development are somehow protected from the risks impacts. Here we see that
world households are protected from the risk impact and also future
reconstruction costs less in case insurance is there. So, I think to answer the
above question that preparation affects immediately to the development, I mean
that your funds are transferred to the protection or insurance instead of development.
Also it impact the development after some time (when risk happens), in this
cases if not or very low protection or insurance schema is taken then there is
severe impacts on your world and hence your development is delayed because 1)
your production is lower because of the risk impact and 2) you have to spend
your funds to the reconstructions and coping with risks results meaning your
earning are lowered as well.<span><br />
2. I played
this game several times to achieve better score. From the first play I did not
get how household connections works and in the next round I was able to use it
and to add additional protection. Also I understood that insurance in this game
is not paid off, it is better to invest in the protection level and spend time
for the risks analysis. So I invested heavily into the development and
protection and used heavily households connections. Also I understood that
risks impacts changing with the time you study this risk, so from the first
glance it can be seen that risk impact is 5 point but after some study it can
come to 7 point. So it is better to have a bit more (I would say 2 levels more)
protection comparing to the risks impact studied. Also I did not get how
obtaining information on the risk (comet) works. I would imagine in real world
that you have to devote some funds (or time), in case of this game funds for
investing in studying of the risks probability, impacts.Â <br /><span>3. I
think Household link function is quite wired not user friendly, so I clicked
somewhere without any idea what it gives. I would think to somehow update it to
see how many connections established and understand on how this connections
impact the risk impacts. The other thing that was discussed in a report is to
supply people (households) with proper information about risks; I think this feature
can be added. Also I think somehow calculation for the insurance in case of
losses upfront have to be done, meaning to understand is it worse to invest in insurance
or not, what will be the gains and what will be the losses in case you are not insured.
Also somehow calculation has to be understood between protection and insurance.
In real world it is like this. I may buy insurance for my car, for not to be
stolen or I can pay for monitored parking which will reduce risk but not in
full, so I can calculate whether to protect my property or just to buy an insurance.</span></span></p></div>
