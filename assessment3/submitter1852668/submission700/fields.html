    <h1>Submission 700 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1852668, session_user_id: cd1b72b824da2ba4b3fcec5043b1394ad4ec8094)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Gamecode: bAG7rZ8</p><p>Risk management is all about
collecting information, as was in the game. Once you are sure about the
possible damage you can expect, you’ll be able to use your resources wisely, to
match the possible outcome and minimize losses. You start to go further in the
game when you realize that focusing in research to find out the chance of hit and possible damage is way cheaper than expend all your money on a ultra-hi-tech not needed security and insurance. </p>

<p>It’s important to match your defensive
system to the size of the threat you'll face; building the “best defensive system
ever made” may be way worse than a very simple that matches the specific
need. Why would you build a 3 meter wall if you only wants to stop your neighbor dog from enter your yard and eat your journal? You will be expending
money and time on something that could be solved by just talking to your neighbor about the
problem, or just building a wood fence, or buying a mailbox. The important
point is to match your needs, save precious resources, and apply them on other
things that are really important.</p>

<p><span>            To do this, you'll need
Information, and information is key on risk management. Accurate, reliable, updated
information. Bad information can be many times worse than no information at all.
Knowing you don’t know something will make you search for it or adopt a secure
route, just to be sure. Having bad information will make you believe that what you
are doing is the right thing. You might end expending a lot more money and time
on something that might never be used or even worse, when it actually happen,
it will not work and people will be confident that they are safe, when
they are not.</span></p>

<p><span>            Last year, on
Brazil, a fire in a nightclub killed more than 240 people that thought where
safe, but when the crisis striked all systems failed and they are dead now. When
you go to a place you think you are safe, because at least in theory, you
should be, or the place shouldn’t be open. That’s just one example of how bad information can endanger
people.</span></p>

<p><span>            The outcome of having reliable, useful
and updated information is to have the certainty of how much money you need to
expend and how much money you can save for investments or others purposes. When
the subject is money is all about finding the right amount to do what you need,
no more, no less. Expending just the right amount will allow you to use that
entire amount that would be expended unnecessarily, on useful things.</span></p>

<p><span>            It will happen, in certain
situations, where you just don’t have the money or for some reason the expense
is so high to prevent the situation that it will be cheaper to let it happen –
if it happen – and fix the damage afterwards. For those situations there are insurance, you pay for it, and when the crisis strikes you are protected, at
least financially. Having insurance allows people to take more risks, because
they feel safe, the same way of having any other system that guarantee they
will make it through.</span></p>

<p><span>            All of three have their own role and
are important to outcome adversity when it happens. It is up for the risk
manager to make the balance between them and chose the right one on each
situation. But undoubtedly information is the first thing to be taken in
consideration, reliable, accurate and updated information, to guide everyone on
the right way.</span></p><p><span>Guilherme Thomas</span></p></div>
