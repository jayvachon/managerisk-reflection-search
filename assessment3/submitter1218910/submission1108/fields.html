    <h1>Submission 1108 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1218910, session_user_id: 70e4ad99a7f2d6bac53222ef581e2ee98dc944fd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>      At the lower
levels of the game (levels one and two), insurance seemed less helpful than did
the prevention measures. Once you get to level three, insurance becomes
important as your buildings are trending toward the higher levels and can
quickly become expensive to repair. By level four it is critical to have
insurance in the early to mid-part of the level and toward the end of the level
you needed to either build up a lot of advanced structures to give yourself a
high development level (ideally far surpassing the necessary line) or raise the
level of your settlement to one of the higher levels to avoid damage from the
comets. I found that the later comets in level four had a much larger impact
than the game predicted, regardless of the amount of research done prior to
impact. I found that even the lower level of insurance was helpful when trying
to quickly repair damaged buildings before the time ran out on each level. </span></p>

<p><span>      I tried building
up a lot of smaller structures in the first couple of times that I played the game,
buying insurance and not raising the level of my settlement up. Then I tried
building fewer structures, raising the level of the settlement and upgrading my
structures more quickly. The latter strategy seemed to work better for me. This
was partially because while the insurance purchased at each level would go away
at the start of the next level, the height of my settlement did not drop
between levels, allowing me to keep my prevention measures in place at higher
levels and use funds then to purchase insurance. I also found that giving
yourself the option to have new structures be built at levels three and four
helped gain the necessary level of cultural advancement, whereas on the
attempts where I was trying to upgrade lots of buildings, I struggled to get
the required advancement in time to successfully complete the level. </span></p>

<p><span>      I would have
liked for there to be an option to “fax all buildings” rather than needing to
click on and repair each building in my settlement individually. I would have
been willing to pay for extra to have that as an insurance policy feature too. </span></p>

<p><span>      It may just be my
perception, but the game does seem to illustrate that at lower levels of income,
prevention is more useful than insurance though that changes as you get more to
lose. I think that this mirrors real life. I know that I did not think about
life insurance much in my early 20’s, but now that I am married, have children
and a house, having life insurance seems a lot more necessary to protect them. The
game has also made me rethink my own prevention measures; I can exercise a
little more, drink a little less, save a little more and pay off my debts a
little faster. None of those on their own will amount to much, but maybe they will
allow me to live a little longer and allow me to provide for my family more completely.
If something does happen to me, they’ll be better off for my having saved and paid
off debts a little faster.</span></p></div>
