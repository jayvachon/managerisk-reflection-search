    <h1>Submission 1420 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4566045, session_user_id: 0c672adbf04cded83b4a3d49ff309867c11773e4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1)    
</span>In the game of Risk Horizon, we
get three kinds of risk management: knowledge, protection and insurance. </p>

<p><span>Knowledge is embodied by the research on each comets, taken
separately. The research gives some results about the probability that the comet
would damage Alora, their severity and the time before impact. It gives the
player a precious tool to help him make his decision. Personally, I systematically
used the research on the comets. If the chance of the comet hitting Alora was
high, I would try to prepare in advance a better protection and so try to match
the severity with the level of Alora. And if I didn’t do it before, I would subscribe
the insurance at the highest level. If it was very low, then I would purely
ignore it, but I would still subscribe the insurance, anyway.  </span></p>

<p>The protection is more something on the long term. While doing so,
the surface of Alora is being lifted up little by little. I would regularly
lift it up, while sustaining development at the same time. Of course I would
lift it faster if some danger was imminent and if the severity was higher than
the altitude of Alora. This part takes some money and time and so it clearly
impedes development on the short run, but it is so important that at the end it
prevents the development from being stopped and even taken aback.</p>

<p>And as for the insurance part, despite all the precautions we take,
the protection we’re doing, sometimes there are just some inevitable disaster,
and we have to protect ourselves against those at least financially. The
experience on this game taught me that we should not be stingy about taking an
insurance, and I always took the most expensive formula, that is to say the
protection against 75% of the damage. And I have always paid less money for the
insurance that what the insurance finally paid for me. So, it is better not to
hesitate to take it. I would say that the money it takes to subscribe it
impedes the development, but it speeds up the recovery speed after a disaster
and less money is being invested at the end thanks to it. </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>2)    
</span>I played the game more than
once. Since the beginning, I used research and insurance as I explained,
without changing anything in the further trials of the game. What changed the
most was my use of protection and the way I developed the planet. To be frank,
I didn’t understand at all how protection did work so I used it at first only
when an asteroid was about to damage the planet. But then, I finally understood
and used it as I explained in the first part. As for the development, the first
game, I built all level 1 pods, then I was planning to update lvl 2 only after
I would have finished all level 1 pods. But in the late parties, I gradually
update pods and let some vacant place for further levels. There are several
explanations to this. First is that is there is some damage, less places are
damaged and so the costs are reduces. Secondly, as the updates go up, the costs
go up as well, and the time it takes to build it also goes up. In doing so, we
can leverage the building phase in terms of available money and time.</p><p><br /></p>

<p><span>3)    
</span>I think if I had to add something
to the game, it would be about introducing people to the game, people that
could act on their own but we still would have the same possibilities in game.
Simply that sometimes, the people would not listen to us. And since it would be
harder to accomplish our task, we should add as well the possibility to
incentive people to do something the way we want.</p>
