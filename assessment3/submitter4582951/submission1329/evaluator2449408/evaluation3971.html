    <div class="field-value">I am impressed with the structure with which you have provided the reflection, though don't agree with your answer on 3.1. The objective here is to consider a natural and uncertain disaster (Real Life scenario). There are some things, which can't be prevented from happening, but definitely one can reduce the causalities. Hope this answers. 

Overall, very well presented </div>
