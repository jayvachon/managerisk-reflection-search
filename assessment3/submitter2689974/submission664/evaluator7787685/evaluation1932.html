    <div class="field-value">A) The key strength of this reflection was the description of the elevation of community as analagous to in real life, as a risk mitigation tool. In addition the suggestion of enhancement to the game was a good, where if development was closer to the shore than inland the risk from meteor and tsunami should be given a higher risk category and hence the cost of protection should have been higher. B) This reflection could have been better if the student would have analysed better the research aspect on the meteor, whereby the severity, chance and insurance cover would have saved costs of protection and insurance to do more development than would have ben done by the student. this an important aspect to understand in risk management since a risk may appear to be evident but the impact is very important to be researched to know what level of mitigation needs to be done.    </div>
