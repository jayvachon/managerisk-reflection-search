    <div class="field-value">The understanding of the individual seems to be good. However, I don't find any clear take away strength from his description. Also, there seems to be a focus on his own regional instability as he talks about private  power and gas which realistically is not available in  most regions.
The reflection needs to not only list out all the point from the course as take away's but also requires the individuals critical appreciation of facts which I think he has missed out upon while listing.</div>
