    <div class="field-value">The reflection is concentrated on what happened in the game. It is focused on achieving higher levels in the game. It provides a strategy to the game. The key learning that emerges though is the reflection that Insurance is important.

The learning derived from interlinking the four components, namely - Insurance, Protection, Knowledge, and Coping, would make the reflection better, For instance, how much money to spend on Insurance, and how much on protection, and the trade-off between them, would increase the learning gained on the Risk Management. This inter-linkage is essential to prepare for the shock and cope with them, once the shock has materialized.</div>
