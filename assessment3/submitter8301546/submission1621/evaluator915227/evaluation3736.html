    <div class="field-value">Amazingly well written article. Language flow was very smooth and all the points were clearly interconnected. Can't point much flaws with the language part.

However, a few points were analytically flawed. For e.g. more research did not decrease chances of hit/severity but more research gave you insights into chances of hit/severity with a higher probability than less research. So, you can see that chances of hit/severity could either increase/decrease by doing more research. Also you could mention how you used a mix of protection and insurance using your knowledge about the comet. Lastly, some more details on how would improve the game would have made the comprehension better.

Good job overall but there is lot of space for improvement.</div>
