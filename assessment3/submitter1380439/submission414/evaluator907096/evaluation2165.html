    <div class="field-value">Key strength of this reflection is he tried his level best to develop his strategies over the time he played the game. And he emphasized mostly in research and got a good & upgraded skill to fight back every time.

According to my judgement he couldn't express what he exactly tried to explain. This reflection was not a symbol of articulation and nothing precise there except the 3rd answer. Precise, brief answer would make his reflection better.</div>
