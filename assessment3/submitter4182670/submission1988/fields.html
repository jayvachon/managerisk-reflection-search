    <h1>Submission 1988 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4182670, session_user_id: dfac61dd865b25633b1e3eda2f05950b8eaff78b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was to combine knowledge (comet research), protection (insurance), externals (community development) to achieve prosperity and make coping with shocks possible. The choices I made were how to build with one eye on developing and fortifying pods while comets threatened to wipe out any progress made.<br /><br />Thankfully, the 75% insurance available for purchase made quick repairs possible although I'm well aware in many parts of the world is not a viable option. I played the game multiple times and realized that the pods themselves could be made stronger with more investment.<br /><br />The main things I learned were:<br />. Insurance helps you recover ground quickly and then provides capital to fortify structures further.<br />. Community is useful for coping and reduces coping time<br />. Building and research must balance each other<br /><br />The funds surprisingly were available soon after a shock. In reality, funds are not so readily available. Perhaps something introducing savings would be helpful.</div>
