    <h1>Submission 2072 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6372, session_user_id: 06844fcd0e36b916aaa1146ec5cef51eac33a4d7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game required you to balance development, protection, insurance and knowledge. <br /><br />I played the game many times. It I successfully completed level five once, but the game crashed before I could complete level six, and I did not record my code at level five, so my official score was failing level five, which I did many times. I quickly learned that I needed to develop as quickly as posable, because the faster you develop the more resources you get. Insurance is not necessary in the early rounds, but is important in the later rounds since the damage seems to grow much faster than the revenues. Protection is very important, and it is best to invest in it early when you have more tolerance in the system. Later in the game resources are more stressed, so you are much better off if you already have a good base level of protection. I'm not sure that research was useful. It made me feel good to know how bad a threat could be, but I'm not sure that the knowledge improved my play.<br /><br />I think the game could be changed to allow you to make an investment in community infrastructure that would buy you more time to click on the links after the disaster.Â </div>
