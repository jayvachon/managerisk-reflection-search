    <div class="field-value">Key strength:  The first part of this reflection is clear and concise, combining  personal experience with theory. Very well-written, and understands importance of research, protection and insurance. I liked the suggested change reccomending a more person-focussed game.

One thing that would make it better is that the review of the article ‘Preparation, Enforcement and Development of Disaster plans’ comes after the reflection and the finidngs from this article are not necessarily tied to the game in any clear way. Do you suggest that these recommendations are all incorporated in future game planning, or that you reflected on these while playing the game? If so, how?
