    <h1>Submission 1287 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3057842, session_user_id: 10c7028e5ed4740f2fa43f359a9641cd693dfc24)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game represents a balance between expenses on the protection of pods and the reward by the development of pods. This gives a view on the concept that we cannot avoid risk but can control potential loss caused by the risk.<br /><br />At the first stage, my strategy was to build several pods, and to moderately increase the protection level. I did not do much research on comets because, to be honest, I even didn't know I can do research on them to lengthen my time limit of the "mouse clicking" little game! And actually, I was doing the "mouse clicking" little game (can hear some doremi rhythm) pretty fast. So usually I need not pay repairing expenses. I did not put much money on developing pods on the second and third stage, and it still goes well as usual. I didn't buy any insurance at all, but I found it very difficult to boost the developing bar in the fourth stage. I put too much time on researching comets, and I did not spend enough money on developing pods. I guess it would be wise to buy some insurance instead of doing research on comets so that I can keep the developing bar boosting faster and in green status. Perhaps the game wants to reflect that when we have a more developed status of a city, we gotta leave out the research on the risk of disaster to the insurance firms and we simply buy insurance from them, so we can focus on developing our economy without fearing about the risk and manage it too much on our own. But I found that it's still not necessary to buy insurance at the first or second stage. It's enough for my own to manage the protection and preparation of the hitting of comets. Usually I got zero damage at these stages. So I guess at the early stage of development of an economy, people should protect themselves from risks by themselves instead of buying insurance. But that's not the case if they really want to go into advanced level of development.<br /><br />I've played it twice, both losing at the fourth stage. At the first time, I didn't put enough money on the development of pods. So I guess it's the reason why I lost. At my second try, I spent more money on pods. But it still didn't work. My development bar boosted faster, but it kept the red color. I don't know why. I guess I still didn't get the pods developed enough, and I put too much time and money on protections and doing research on comets, although I could indeed kept no damage of all pods. So perhaps I should buy some insurance, let damages happen more frequently, and pay some money on repairing those damage in order to trade for a faster boost of the development bar, if I really want to advance into higher stage (fifth or sixth).<br /><br />Actually I don't buy this idea. The game urged me to develop an advanced economy too fast. I think it's not good to boost up the development of our economy, while at the same time also increase the probability of realizing damages. We pay insurance, which lessens our expenses on recovering from damages so that we can keep more money to develop our economy. But simultaneously we realize damages more frequently, and we simply rely on insurances to handle the economic loss due to these damages. This is a moral hazard problem. I think the game should slow down the pace of economic development a little bit more.<br /></div>
