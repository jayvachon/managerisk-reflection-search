    <h1>Submission 2244 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2412545, session_user_id: 228e8eabd8b8ac14c9140a0de8b00214965943ab)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of this Risk Management Game was to simulate a real life situation involving risk management. As we was taught in the lectures, By increasing protection and buying insurance we protect are selves from risk but lower are growth.In impoverished areas the costs of protection may seem far more devastating than a crisis. An example is the rising cost of insurance, while it proved effective when the meteors hit it was very tempting to lessen insurance if the research had shown less than a 20% chance of the meteor hitting, balancing out risk with growth.<br /><br />2.Some of the things I would differently if i replayed the game would be to Maximize more growth as my undoing was being to cautious, in a world of risk, sometimes it may be wiser to take growth over low damage or low chance crisis.Some of the things i learned for the game is the real life concept of the risk, and growth as well as my personal preference to more security than growth.<br /><br />One change I would make while playing this game is a human addition, the concept of human population or moral, while this game helps to highlight the basis of risk/development it doesn't do Justice to real leadership descions that don't just involve buildings but the peoples satisfaction and livelihood during such events.Living in an area that is prone to hurricanes i believe that the concept of prediction and research well defines my area.</div>
