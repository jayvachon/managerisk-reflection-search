    <div class="field-value">Very good reflection. I would like to remark several strengths but if I have to choose only one, I think that the key strength is the last comment about the pod proximity because it seems a really interesting action line to improve this game and to do it even more realistic.
This reflection would be a little better if there was less game descriptions and more reflections.</div>
