    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In fact I am not used to play game on line ,if i should say that i never play what sort of game on line .I had difficulties to move the cursor on the right goal at the right moment .The interest of the game is to show that there is risk that we can not really see ,but that we must avoid or at least minimize the effects .Of course there is a possibility of making a lot of reflection about the picture of comet falling in the see and the result of destruction ; as explained the main goal being to protect the community .<br />I think everyone is taking a risk at his own level , there are good and bad opportunities ,and good opportunities does not refer only to big profit or less loss ,but at this level of Risk Horizon the goal is to survive as a community;at this point my reflection is to increase as possible research and insurance but it is perhaps wise to define insurance in this horizon ;as big external shocks being not avoidable , research can be important to survive in different conditions that can occur by other internal shocks . Insurance at this time will be a grant to act in different situation and bring opportunities to survive .</div>
