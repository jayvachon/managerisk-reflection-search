    <h1>Submission 1098 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7342206, session_user_id: 260c51b4ef03d19db402a34d131fc8ff7bd53007)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Spending more time on research, knowledge management and information gathering on locally made technologies which is proved to be cheap helps a lot in keeping abreast with all the externalities. Serious  research should be geared toward discovering, understanding more comets and comets related activities, the more time you prepare for it, the less damages you will however record, because people knowledge is raised, best practices is shared, basic escape guideline, rules and regulation and do's and don't impacted on the people and that makes them less vulnerable because their awareness is raised.
In addition to huge investment of viable city infrastructure provided, understanding historical, topography, sea level and it behavior especially now with climate change, the sea level rise, construction should take note of all the externalities in other to reduce the impact of whatever risk that might come.
Preparation for risk management affect development in just few ways, it however slow the phase of development putting risk management atop means doing the right things to safeguard the future therefore risk management preparation affect development immediate and after sometime. Now this can be done by building foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficult to design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will react and how the context will change.
So we really need to implement basic policies that focus on what's most important, like setting the right incentives for people to manage the risk well or making the information available, and to make sure the policies are revised over time regularly to correct, over time, when more information is available or when we observe that some policies might have some negative side consequences.
To me the game should be simplified, with a real life scenerios or the game should be community based prototype approach, where all the features of a semi-urban community should be captured clearly, and I also recommend that when that is done it will go a long away in spreading the knowledge and create or raise awareness, prepare people mind on the impending risk we faced as individual, community, state, nations and as a globe which could either be financial risk, natural disaster, climate change or health related risk e.g the sub-Saharan AFrica is faced with an epidemic of EBOLA disease outbreak a very deadly disease ravaging the whole region, now since the spread is moving fast, the  second principle is to build foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficult to design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will react and how the context will change. But educating the people on what to do at this material time is important in other to reduce the collateral damage it might result to.
If allowed to change some things in the game, surely it would be focused on a real life situation, where it can simplicity, acceptance, reference point for teachers and student of risk management, children would be catched young with a simplify game as they play it does not only prepare their mind on evacuation guideline only but equally prepare their mind on real time risk we faced in the society.
Finally, the game for me has enlightened, educate and raised my awareness on the various dangers we're faced daily, it also made me to be an observer of my environment around me.</div>
