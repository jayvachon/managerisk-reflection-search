    <h1>Submission 1313 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7627825, session_user_id: 2c3c17e2c511524251b830171f125a036b8c7260)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Risk management is at the heart of this game. Winning requires a judicious balance between several risk management strategies: researching risks associated with each meteor (knowledge acquisition), increasing the elevation of the terrain to avoid damage from tsunamis (protection from risk), purchasing building insurance to mitigated against damage (insurance)' and pursuing economic growth to ensure sufficient funds for all risk management measures. </div><div><br /></div><div>Playing the game demonstrates some of the real life challenges of risk management. For example, an overly cautious approach with too much emphasis on protective measures leaves insufficient time and money left over for economic development; and before long this cautious approach fails because there is not enough funding available to upgrade the protective measures that survival depends on. On the other hand, an approach focusing too strongly on economic growth is inadequate (even with good insurance against damage) because ultimately the recurring cost of repairs leads to bankruptcy. </div><div><br /></div><div>A key learning from the game is that it takes some practice to find the best balance between the different risk management options, and only by getting the balance right can you succeed. </div><div><br /></div><div>The game is based on a very simplified scenario with only one risk factor (meteors/flooding). Version 2 could be made more realistic by adding other risk factors (storms, droughts, fire, etc) and perhaps also some uncertainty to spice things up a little!</div></div>
