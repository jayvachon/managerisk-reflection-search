These comets careen in water and create waves that damage Alora's infrastructure, thus hinder development in Alora.</div><div>Risk Management had an important role in the game.Indeed,it helped to prepare for the potential shocks,and to cope ones the shock occur.</div><div>Preparation include establishing policy in terms of Insurance,protection based on what we know about the nature of the comets.</div><div>To be effective in our risk management,we needed to find the way,to link the key component of risk Management.</div><div>We mainly focused on this:</div><div>First,we insisted on the level of research,because,effectiveness of insurance and protection need to gather a lot of information about the severity of a comet,and its probability to hit Alora' island.We didn't chose a high level of reserch for the first time,by the way,our protection wasn't too much efficient to quick recover.Eventually, we increased research,to have the same uptrend,in terms of protection.</div><div>About,Insurance,we have always chosen the high level of insurance,because it won't cost a lot if protection is high.</div><div>Finally,our decision to increase protection didn't have its expected result of reducing insurance fees in the short term,because,protection specially in the game,have long term effects.</div><div>If we had to play the game more than once,we schould have focused our strategy more on good research.First,because knowledge is a key element in the process to establish a strategy to manage effectively the risk of falling comets in Alora.</div><div>Second,it gives us more time to create a strong community connection right before the comet hits,helping to boost protection.Finally,research helped a lot in the game to reach our milestone.</div><div>To sum up what things we learned from the game,it's necessary to come back to its main goal,which is capturing some aspects of risk management in a simple way.</div><div>This way.Our mission,bring us to learn that risk management is critical for development.And that development,is as well as risk management is a continuous process thus we can't aim to complete it.</div><div>Also,We learned the importance of knowledge,how it is critical such in preparation and coping.</div><div>In my project to bring the game better represent the risk management,I will add a device in the interface which regulates financial ressources availability.</div></div>
