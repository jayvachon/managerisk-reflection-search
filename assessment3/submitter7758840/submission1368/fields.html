    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game is to develop the community by building <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">pots</span><span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">.</span>To save the pods from damage i.e Protect by means of conducting research and also to insure pods against any potential damage. The duty of the player is to monitor the upcoming danger in the form of comet and to take required action. The knowledge level on the comets helped to make necessary arrangements and prepared to face the risk. I had played the game twice. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">I cou</span>ld manage second time to reach level 3 by spending more on doing research and constantly upgrading the pods. I could able to withstand the risk and <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">i</span> found it difficult when trying to develop new pods along with existing one. I suggest there could be some kind of technology tool available in the game similar to lighting arrestor which when installed could absorb maximum damage. This technology may be <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">availabe</span> if more than $1000 are once available to manage risk effectively.</div>
