    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this game reflection is that an attempt was made to answer all three questions and it demonstrates a basic understanding of the rules and aim of the game with respect to the course definitions.

Unfortunately the reflection is so short (approx.  160 words) it does not show a strong link in comprehension to the course nor does it investigte all the questions asked to complete the reflection.  This game reflection describes the game more than it analyses and answers the questions.</div>
