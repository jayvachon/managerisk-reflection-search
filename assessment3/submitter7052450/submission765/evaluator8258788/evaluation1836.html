    <div class="field-value">While the response was strong in terms of answering the questions posed by the instructors, I wish the reflection had been written in integrated essay format as opposed to fragmented Q&A format. To be sure, the essay would need to address the questions but could have been embedded into the essay. secondly, I found the suggestion that the game should focus on funding aspect of risk management and the rest left to "auto-pilot" not compelling enough for me. In real life we all have to juggle several tasks simultaneously and make trade-offs. So, I see no reason not to simulate it in a virtual game.  And, the suggestion that the game should have provided an option for the player to send someone to the city (presumably as an alternative to dealing with the risks brought about by the comet) is in the right spirit but could use some further refinement. All in all the writer should be commended for the effort.</div>
