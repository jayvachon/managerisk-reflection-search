    <h1>Submission 765 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7052450, session_user_id: 67d3655894e5000c991bbcc4b69464d75cbd80e6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><u>Question 1:</u><br />The role of risk management in the game was to manage the risk of the comet strike vs the need to grow the pods within the time limit.<br /><br />Choices and tradeoffs were made.  Knowledge could be gained by watching the comets.  Protection could be gained but it was slow and time-consuming.  Insurance could be bought at the last minute and upgraded if the comet severity and accuracy was high.  The tradeoff was between watching the comet to gain research time vs protection bars.  I tended to protect as much as possible and only research the comet when it was halfway over the horizon, since the research meter filled quite quickly to a maximum.  Insurance was bought quite soon, usually before the 1st comet struck.<br /><br />Preparation for risk of comet strike diverted attention from pod development and watching the clock.<br /><br /><u>Question 2:</u><br />Protection needs a long time.  Subsequent replays started with early protection, even before the first comet was seen.  Pod development was less important and more expensive than developing new pods.  Comet strikes distracted focus from watching the clock and usually led to eventual failure.<br /><br /><u>Question 3:</u><br />It would have been interesting to have an option to send a family member to the city to send money back and see whether it was a worthwhile investment.  E.g. it might cost $800 to send the family member to the city.  Also, it would be interesting if all the features could be put on autopilot and were dependent on funding.  Then the player only had to decide where to allocate money; e.g. on pods, researching comets, building protection, buying insurance, etc.  In the real world, time moves relatively slowly and the main question is cashflow and where to allocate funds.  This would be the question of economic risk management for a state, or financial risk management for the individual.</div>
