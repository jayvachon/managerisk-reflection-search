    <h1>Submission 1239 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7938781, session_user_id: 7e8afc2ec8d349c1225578385028bd9bf3934f90)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of the risk management game was to learn how to make wise choices to protect the community, cope with damages and consequences of lost and making progress in the same time. I have learned that we have to balance the research, protection and insurance in order to progress. In the first levels of the game, the most important was building and developing, while at higher levels, protection, research and insurance played bigger role. I kept the insurance on the lowest level and manage to not have big losses or no damage at all. In my opinion, preparation for risk affect development after some time. I played the game more than once. My first attempts lacked from development. I put more emphasis on the insurance (buying the most expensive one) and having the highest level of protection. I didn't manage to build all the pods and I failed to gain knowledge about the comets. I progress with my attempts. And on level 4, I balanced the four components: development, knowledge, protection and knowledge.          <br /> Regarding the game, I would add not all the comets, as a global risk that threatens the community, but also some risks that are related to individual pods. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
