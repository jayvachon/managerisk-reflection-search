    <h1>Submission 289 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1194667, session_user_id: 96716332e2acd6a8b0c603c31f644ae80c258550)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game was a novel idea of making us understand the nuances of risk management. Risk management was a sheer act of balancing between protecting our island from the comets while ensuring that development did not slow down. While I was trying to understand possible shocks and their chances of hitting the island, I had to most often reduce the pace of my development, due to which either I had a huge amount of money with me by the time I researched on one particular comet or had no time to use the protection slider to raise the level of the island from the sea. Therefore I would focus on pulling the protection slider whenever a comet that was unlikely to hit would pass by. <br /><br />In my initial attempts, I would always use the highest priced insurance cover. This was manageable during the early stages of the game, however as soon as I reached level 3, I was to realize that I would exhaust almost all my money in getting my assets insured. As a result I would have to patiently wait for the money to replenish in order to undertake development activities. Due to the lack of sufficient instructions provided to us in the earlier days, it took me quite some time to figure out that there was a mini game to be played once the comet hit the island! Once I understood that I had to make community connections by hitting on the yellow glows, there occurred zilch/negligible damage. Such a setting would allow me to easily cope with the mid priced insurance cover that I had now begun to take. <br /><br />The number of attempts that I made at the game were like the number of huge disasters that strike developing nations at a gap of a few years. With increasing number of my attempts at the game, I was better prepared for the next calamity, by way of balancing between knowledge, protection and insurance. It was fun to discover part by part how to play the game on my own, just as different communities around the world become more adept at mitigation strategies as regards the disasters that would strike in the future. In fact I learnt that developmentÂ  for the sake of development, would mean that I would not be able to proceed to higher levels in the game. Although research was a slow process and required a lot of patience, it was inexpensive as compared to holding the protection slider. Also, having researched well, I would get adequate time to establish community connections. All this made me draw parallels with real life. Usually, state government/communities in developing nations spend on expensive technology for acquiring protection, while investment in research remains abysmally low. But research incurs increasing returns in the long run and also leads to lesser erosion of money from public coffers.<br /><br />In order to increase the risk management choices, I would improvise on the way community connections are established. Instead of just connecting the yellow glows, there would be two options that would have to be simultaneously done - performing safety drills and holding community meetings. Also with increasing levels in the game, I would provide for technology improvement boosters with which the player could either increase the speed of development or the pace of research; whatever their priority. <br /><br /><i>In conclusion, I would say, that having a raw guidance as to 'How to Play' the game, helped me learn more about risk management than a set of detailed instructions that we as players would usually prefer to have. </i><br /></div>
