    <h1>Submission 862 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4760258, session_user_id: 92a9f1daf58a1ec3087e65372b5a721f95345cf3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management - core of Risk Horizon,
play an essential role in the whole game, and the top risk of the game is hit
by the comets, which cause huge damage.</p>

<p><span>There was $1000 in account and 150 seconds at the very beginning.
I built 4 interface devices as quickly as possible before the first comet
appear, and bought the third option (the biggest number) of the Insurance. Then
I clicked the comet to get the research. The information of the research
included three parts: severity, chance of hit, and the process bar of the research.
Sometimes there were several comets appear in a short time, so before the comet
hit the horizon, I made priority to deal with the risk based on the research. When
the comet closed to the horizon, I use the protection to decrease the damage.
Before that, I focused on build more devices by using the increasing money and get
more knowledge. In the following level, I tried to upgrade the device and buy
the insurance when I get enough money. Due to there were so many comets in the
higher level, and it can not avoid the hit, the protection is necessary.</span></p>

<p>I played the game twice. At the first time,
I failed in level Two. The second time, won level Two but failed in level
Three. If I play the game again, I will try to balance the time in doing the
research, building devices and making early protection. The things I learn from
the game is that – when facing the risk, we can not avoid it. We should make
the solution first, use the time wisely, reduce the waste of all the resources,
try to make up the damage as soon as possible and get more knowledge from the
risk.</p>

<p>If I am allowed to change the game a little
bit, I will suggest add a role of Government. When the research reaches to a formulated
number, the government will provide the courage and reward such as a new type
of advanced device. On the contrary, if the damage is too much, the government
will provide more support, including the fund support or some experts to make a
better solution for the risk. </p>

<p><span>After all, risk management is a challenge
to save more lives, and also, it is a gate to development. We should face the
reality and make sure all the roles of society do their own excellent job to
make the world a better place.</span></p></div>
