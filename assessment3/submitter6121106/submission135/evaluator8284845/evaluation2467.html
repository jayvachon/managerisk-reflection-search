    <div class="field-value">A key strenght of this essay is the reflective element. You have reflected well on the choices you made in the game, the changes you made between attempts and on risk management where you live.

The reflection could be improved by improving the clarify of your writing some sentences were difficult to understand and had completely opposite meanings depending on how mistakes were corrected, making it difficult to properly assess those sentences.</div>
