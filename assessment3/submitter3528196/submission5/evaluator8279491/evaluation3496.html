    <div class="field-value">The key strength in this reflection is the usage of risk management terminology and the description about the game settings.
However, the student didn't address the questions sufficiently. For example, I don't don't know what his/her trade-off decisions were and neither when risk management affects development. 
Furthermore, I don't see value in the addition of different languages as this would't make me understand the impact of risk management on development better.  </div>
