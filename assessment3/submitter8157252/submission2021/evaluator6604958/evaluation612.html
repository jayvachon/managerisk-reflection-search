    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the good description of the possible ways of playing this game, in order to explore all the possibilities. 
However, this text doesn't answer to all questions that were presented, e.g. what would be a good improvement to the game's next version. I think it would also need a deeper reflection about the game options and what does it represent in terms of risk management. It would be important to have a parallelism to our reality: what do we learn here that could help us in our real life?   </div>
