    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I attempted this game more than once
because I wanted to try different strategies.</p>
<p>First, I tried simply to protect from
waves the pods I had built. I wanted to verify if it was possible to
develop the pods only by preventing them from being damaged. It was
not the case, because the remaining resources and money were no more
enough to allow a development within the given time. Therefore, in
another attempt I decided to allocate some money for insurance. I
decided for an insurance plan with a 50% coverage. I think it was the
right choice because it allowed me to invest  more money for pod
development. I paid also more attention to the information about the
comets (chance of the comet hitting, and the severity of the comet).
With this information I protected in a more effective way the pods,
without wasting useful resources. In a third attempt I purchased a
cheaper insurance plan. That was a good strategy for small damages,
but when the damages were huge, the coverage was too small and the
repairing costs too high, so that they prevent pods from achieving a
good development in time. I tried also another strategy: I insure
pods with a 75% coverage plan to recover lost development time and I
used the rest of resources to develop the pods. This strategy proves
as well to be not winning. Despite the very high insurance coverage,
the damages caused by some comets were so severe, that the time and
costs to repair them were too  high. Some of these costs could have
been avoid just by observing comets and protecting pods. That has
clearly shown how the different components of the risk management are
all needed.</p>
<p>I have found this game a very pleasant
way to test the idea of effective and responsible risk management
consisting in a balance between developing and preparing for
potential shocks. But I have found the time at disposal to complete
each level too short. Sometimes I took a choice too quickly, without
having the time to think about a better option.
