    <h1>Submission 669 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1639344, session_user_id: 47a89072c50e6318a9438259fa3caaf60dcb68d3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?<br />The game aims to prepare the community to manage the potential shocks caused by the comets and the following waves. <br /><br />My priority is to build a minimum set of luminated blocks and upgrade them as high as possible, meanwhile increase the height of my island. Clearly protection is my priority. I did not focus much on research and insurance until I reached Level 4.<br /><br />I prepare for risk immediately. <br /><br /><br /><div><div>2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?</div></div>I played the game twice. The first time I did not even pass Level 1, and the second time I reached the highest level. The main difference between the two times is at the second time, I focus more on upgrading the luminated blocks. I think it is critical to ensure the quality of the protection.  <br /><br /><br /><span>3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</span><p>Provide more selections of protection. </p><div></div></div>
