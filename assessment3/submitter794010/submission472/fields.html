    <h1>Submission 472 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 794010, session_user_id: 14173267f34c5b5e778d7cc514b631c45f24efb0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk game reflection:</p>

<p>What I learned from playing the game as well as listening to
the video lectures are that Risk Management is a very useful to have but not
the easiest thing to accomplish. 
Balancing various elements to accomplish the goals is very
challenging.  The role of risk management
in the game is critical to be successful. 
It requires a strategic thinking to advance from level to level. </p>

<p>I had a hard time increasing the protection level to match
comet’s damaging level. I felt I was not able to use all three items freely. That
is the only part of the game that was frustrating to me.  I believe I can do a better job advancing if
the protection level works better.  I
could balance better the tradeoffs on the game for each situation (comet
potential hits).  So having a good knowledge
is great to assess what actions to take for that particular event.</p>

<p>I played the game several times and able to learn and do
things differently to see if the outcome can be better for me.  First I did not buy enough insurances, I learned
without enough insurance it costs more to build as well as it cost more time to
build it.  Then I over bought the
insurance and wasted the resources which in turn slows down the building of
community.</p>

<p>So I try to balance all of the elements, buy enough
insurance, continue with building the community and have enough protection for
the negative event.  In doing so, you can
then advance to the next level. I believe this is the right approach of Risk
Management.  </p>

<p>When you thought you have a good strategy, you ran out of
time.  This happens several times during
the games.  I realize that in the real
life events, all of these parameters exist and one must be able to assess the
situation properly to mitigate the negative events when happen. After playing
the game I have a better understanding the critical role of the government when
natural disasters occur.  In Japan, the
tsunami thread is large and they are able to put in place the warning system as
well as practice of simulated event, yet the other risk like the nuclear plant
ruptured are not part of it. </p>

<p>Here in Arizona, we have minimal natural disasters such as
tornadoes, earth quake, etc… but we do have issue with limited water resources.
So if we have a prolong draught, we can have a negative impact with our lives.  It would be wise for our state government to
have risk management to mitigate the situation. 
We are also a growing state, many people migrated to our state.  This also will add pressure to the water
resources.  Balancing development,
insurance as well as protection is a difficult task to do but an important
thing to have. I hope our state has a risk management in place.</p></div>
