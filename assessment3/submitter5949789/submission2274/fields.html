    <h1>Submission 2274 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5949789, session_user_id: 24f835392828814b7cd0d7ccd987a6cbd8af4a42)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The dynamics within the game are interesting in the way you need to balance a. research on the risks, b. mitigation measures through networking, c. the need for insurance coverage, and d. the desire to expand the business. this requires thinking simultaneously about these dynamics and seeing how they affect each other. for instance, if the risk (the meteor) will hit anyway, then it don't make sense to suddenly invest and not preserving the needed cash for reconstruction, what is required in this case is to keep on clicking on the mitigation measures to minimize the actual impact of the risk. 

In all cases i opted for the maximum insurance given the increased expected saving, particularly that you get hit all the time with meteors, especially the property in the middle line. So what i did is built three units in the top and bottom and left the center empty, and upgraded them as soon as i could. this allowed me sufficient resources to rebuild.

A critique on this case is that it does not simulate real life situations, who would invest in such a high-risk environment? Furthermore, the insurance compensation was 3-times as much as a the premium in each situation, and we know that real life does not work like that. The game illustrates the key messages, however it could've been designed to be closer to real life situations. Plus, research does not always give you detailed information about the risks, particularly systemic and devastating risks the report and the MOOC discusses. Just my two cents. Cheers. </div>
