    <div class="field-value">actually i liked very much the essay made by this colleague , very briefed , very clear , he described very well, what he experienced in the game , tried to put hat up with the real world , the only thing was not clear for me what were the difficulties he faced trying to manage these risks in how he could make it up in the next attempts,

but in general it was really good
cheers! </div>
