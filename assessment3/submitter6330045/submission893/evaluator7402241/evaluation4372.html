    <div class="field-value">Good strategy that implemented some key points from the lecture such as ensuring safety (increasing the level) while encouraging economic growth (more comets and updates). It is true that the community support in this game was a bit over estimated and useless (in some cases). Having a clearer and more effective community support system will allow the game to have a better representation of the real life and therefore capture the true vision of risk management</div>
