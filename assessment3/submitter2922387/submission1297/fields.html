    <h1>Submission 1297 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2922387, session_user_id: 0709a6b0b3e495e9cab10bcc219694bbf98e008a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The concepts of Risk Management were applied in the game- building and running a nation( simulation). I mainly focused on development. I decided to raise protection depending on the comet( severity &amp; chance to create damage). I purchased the basic insurance package but went for the best one when I had the capital. It mainly felt good when I was prepared and the comet missed. The preparedness prolonged.<br /><br />2) I played the game more than once and I learned about balancing development and safety( protection + insurance). I learnt that buying insurance just before the comet struck helped me purchase a better plan right at the last moment. The importance of timely development was duly noted. I understood that the importance of targets real life nations have in various fields. I tried to tackle time by developing my pods continuously. It helped my generate better revenue. At the same time, I used the generated revenue to buy the best insurance package available.<br /><br />3) If I were to add a feature, I would add a Research and Development button to know which type of comet hits which area and draw the pattern about their arrival( seasonal/quarterly/monthly or in this game, a matter of seconds). I would price this feature very high because learning about comets requires vast resources and data. By doing this, the nature of comets and the type of damage caused by them could be understood well. I am reminded of the Earthquake in Chile as I type this. It helped me play the game better.<br /></div>
