    <h1>Submission 2455 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6493746, session_user_id: 6fa8fefafbc3c6eb5a822432822856ccace3f782)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was to prepare for risks and cope with their effect, so that the town I established could develop.<br /><p>I had the means (i.e knowledge, information, finances) to confront the risks my town faced, in particular from the effects of meteorite/ comet strikes. These means were costly and I therefore needed to apply them strategically. Preparations for risk affected the development of my town both in the short term (i.e rebuilding pods that were insufficiently protected) and in the longer run.</p><p>I have learned that sharing risk with others helps can overcome obstacles and that  knowledge, protection and insurance applied in equal measure are effective as a support system: “A stitch in time saves Nine”.</p><p>I live in Mali, and work for the united nations. Mali is in the throes of a conflict between the northern communities (mainly arab and tuareg) and the government in the south. One risk management element that we use is mediation, as a way of reconciling hearts and minds. I would therefore add an element of mediation in this game, were the scenario a little different.</p>
