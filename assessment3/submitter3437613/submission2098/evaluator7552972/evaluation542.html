    <div class="field-value">The student made a very concise summary about the challenges and opportunities that are depicted in the game.
I think that he understood the concepts about Risk Management described on the video lectures and in the WDR-2014. In addition, he also suggests some other concepts that are important for Risk Management.
It was an excellent reflection.
