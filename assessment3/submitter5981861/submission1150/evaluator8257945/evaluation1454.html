    <div class="field-value">This reflection lacks of answers to the 3 questions that we have been given. This is due basically to the inability of fully understanding the game and its functioning. As a result I am not able to make an informed review.
The student hightlights the difficult interpretation of the game and has not understood how the research aspect was formulated precisely. I must confess that this does not surprise me, as I had similar problems in understanding the game, that appeared too complex as a formulation but to poor in contents. 

The student points out that the game was about events that are not even conceptualized in players minds, adding an unuseful complication. Events or hazards that are closer to people lives could have been taken differently. 

However, I believe that by reading more carefully game rules and perhaps the reading material, this reflection could have been written better.</div>
