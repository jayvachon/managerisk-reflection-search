    <h1>Submission 1150 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5981861, session_user_id: ac994d761fa2986afdf50da3411caa3526aca8fb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Friends,<br />I understand, this game is about how we take up development by allocating resources, expenditure on research to assess the likely damages, whether to buy insurance to cover (if not full at least part of repair cost) matching to one's risk taking ability. There is one more aspect of how best we can prepare community to share the resources and damages. The second part of sharing resources by clicking on illuminated and dark pods was not clear to me. I could clear only two stages, that too with a lot of difficulties, about 3 hours of play!!. I am not sure about the game till, though we understand when to go for insurance (when the chances of hit as well as severity is very high) and that too when it comes as sudden. The severity and chances of hit is changing at times at the last moment. When the pods were under development and meteors were around, i was constantly buying research. It appears, I am not ready for taking risk, because, at the end, my report says I have spent lot on research when the damage was the least, same is the case with insurance also. <br /><br />My reflections after the game is i) I could not play the game with ease, may be my preparation was not complete to understand, play and learn the game ii) may be my playing environment - laptop and windows system was not the best, iii) in a hurry to complete the assignment so that to watch the FIFA final and iv) Despite all, I am sure, the game is relevant, makes one to prioritize resource allocation for the development works, research to assess the likely damage and insure the property if the research suggest imminent and severe damage. <br /><br />If I am asked to design a game I would rather take the example of events which are common in our daily routine, say building blocks, driving, farming, etc. No doubt, this game serves the purpose, but <strong>occurrence</strong> of meteor itself is not regular or not at all a frequent event, though the magnitude is incomprehensible; in real life situation <strong>resources</strong> have to be mobilized, not just grows just like that; when we mobilize resources, risk taking ability is <strong>spread over a group</strong> - for house finance - banker certainly would ask me to go for insurance, whether I go for quality material or not; even<strong> sanction process</strong> is by a team. All these are not to justify my inability to understand the game and score up to level six. Consolation is I am once again reminded the basics of resource allocation in anticipation of "unexpected". <br /><br />CHEERS!!!!     <br /></div>
