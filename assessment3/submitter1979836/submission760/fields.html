    <h1>Submission 760 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1979836, session_user_id: 79122f03cf0bd99176f5bf477397f026b8d73381)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">While I found the game quite interesting and addictive, I didn't see quite as much risk management in it as I had expected. I expected more focus to be placed on issues such as insurance and mitigation. That being said, however, after having played the game several times, I realized that the focus should be on development, while keeping research and protection under control. During my first few games, i mainly focused on risk prevention, rather than on developing the buildings and doing research. During the last, winning, game, i focused more on development, while also ensuring that I am protected enough against possible risks. For instance, during this last game, I never even had to buy insurance. I simply did not need it, since my buildings were all at the latest development stage, with ground was high enough not to be damaged by the meteorite impact, and my research gave me pretty accurate information on what was to come. So, preparation for risk did affect development when i focused mainly on risk prevention. However, once I have found a balance between development and mitigation, I had no problem keeping everything in check. The lesson I can find in all this is that development cannot do without risk management and vice versa. <br />If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would bring two changes to the game. First, I would add some other potential risks - thus making the players have to decide which hazards should take precedence and thus learning that most threats usually do not come alone. Secondly, I would like to enhance the community communication aspect of the game. I believe that pre, during and post communication is vital to proper risk management. </div>
