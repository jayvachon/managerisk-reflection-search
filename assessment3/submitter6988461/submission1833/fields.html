    <h1>Submission 1833 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6988461, session_user_id: a1caef92aee68af13bb112a3b6c9c36dcd3d6801)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is to prevent loss which do happen due to comets hits the sea which resulted to wave destruction of the development projects maintained for a long time.<br /><br />I had to choose between research, insurance and protection due to budget constraints. I used to insure by development which compensated. I used research to protect my self from the current losses just as i used protection.<br /><br />Preparation affects development in that: The fund which could have be used for development i have used for: insurance, protection and knowledge. It also affect development in long tern in case the risks protected for does not happen.<br /><br />I have played the game more that once. in order to meet my development goal i had to simultaneously ensure my level of protection,knowledge and insurance is maintained along with efforts for development. I do have to many times to consider severity and hit meters so as to know whether i was in the risk to loose. I also have to upgrade or develop my region to ensure maximum development.<br /><br />From the game I learned that: Development is subjected to risks which if not considered and planned for it my result in a loose which can hinder development in long run. Hence proper plans to prepare against and complies with the expected/resulted risk should be be implemented.<br /><br />From the game, I would propose to replace comets with bad weather condition. This is because I live in the place with people whose main development activities is agriculture. These peasants depend in rainfall to rise and harvest the product. As a result they are faced with the risk of bad weather condition such as shortage of rainfall/droughts. <br /><br />Thus proper effort should be devoted to insure,protect and do research( waether forecast) to be able to predict and or have a means of being compensated ( for instance insurance) in case it happen out of prediction.</div>
