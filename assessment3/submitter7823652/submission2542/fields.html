    <h1>Submission 2542 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7823652, session_user_id: fa8afc51053214715c1c67f59d98f79dd94f8b2b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i>1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did
you make and what trade-offs did you</i></p>

<p><i>confront in terms of knowledge, protection and insurance? In what ways
did preparation for risk affect</i></p>

<p><i>development (immediately, or after some time)?</i></p>

<p><br /></p><p>The role of risk management was essential for the survival of the
community and for success in the game.</p>

<p>Although I invested in all three risk management tools, my primary focus
was on research. By monitoring the</p>

<p>comets I was constantly informed about what was going on in space and
able to prepare for their impact. I also</p>

<p>gathered precious time to reduce these impacts. Secondly I invested in
lifting up the community, whenever I had</p>

<p>fully researched an incoming, highly severe comet in order to reduce its
damage further. By buying only the</p>

<p>cheapest insurance, I neglected a little bit this option, so the
tradeoff for me was between prevention/protection</p>

<p>and insurance/repairing. I prefer avoiding damage in the first place and
not to deal with its aftermaths. By doing</p>

<p>so I was able to develop my community quite fast, because research was
reducing my cash-flow not too much,</p>

<p>although constantly, similar to protection, which didn’t reduce my stock
of cash immediately as well.</p>

<p><br /></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if
you were to play it again? Alternatively,</i></p>

<p><i>if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after
the first time? What were the main</i></p>

<p><i>things you learned from the game?</i></p><p><i><br /></i></p>

<p>I played the game more than once and in the beginning I neglected the
research part. I just checked the severity</p>

<p>and probability of the comets, so I didn’t had too much time for
building up connections between the pods of my</p>

<p>community. The main thing I learned was that it is essential to be fully
aware and prepared. I did quite well till</p>

<p>level 4: I had upgraded all my pods to level 3, some of them even to
level 4, was 50% protected, and had a lot of</p>

<p>cash even after I bought the maximum insurance for the first time, but
then a highly severe comet was</p>

<p>approaching so fast, that even with all of my precautions, the community
was damaged too much, so that I</p>

<p>couldn’t reach level 6 and lost the game. I learned that doing well
quite a bit can lead to a false sense of security,</p>

<p>which can lead to extinction.</p>

<p><br /></p><p><i><br /></i></p><p><i>3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk
management. Imagine you are tasked with</i></p>

<p><i>developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add
one simple thing. What change</i></p>

<p><i>would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that
matter in the place you live?</i></p>

<p><br /></p><p>I live in Austria in the middle of the Alps, so every year in winter we
are confronted with the risk of avalanches.</p>

<p>Avalanches get studied very well; some of them are triggered by experts
on purpose in a controlled environment</p>

<p>in order to keep them small. Barriers also have been built in order to
protect villages and ski resorts. There are</p>

<p>many reasons, why avalanches are triggered. Often it’s because of
careless people, who are skiing outside of the</p>

<p>official slopes, so I would add another option to the game: education.
Educating the people of the community</p>

<p>about the risk of avalanches and how they are triggered, reduces also
the risk of avalanches killing people and</p>

<p>destroying houses.</p>
