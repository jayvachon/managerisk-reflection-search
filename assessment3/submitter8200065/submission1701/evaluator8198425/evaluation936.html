    <div class="field-value">The  student managed to relate what was happening in the game to real life.  He/she did not manly talk about what happened in the game.  The student is able to apply the knowledge they have and understanding into anything.

This reflection was put together well, although I would suggest the student to add spaces between paragraph to make it a more readable.
