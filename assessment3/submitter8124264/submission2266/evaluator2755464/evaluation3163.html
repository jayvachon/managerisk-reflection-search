    <div class="field-value">Clarity and comprehension were the key strengths of this reflection.The student seems to fully understand the core concepts of the course as reflected in this game exercise.One thing that would have made this reflection even better is that they student should have localized the change/addition to the game.Although the student indicated what they would add/change,the evaluation rubrics asks "in your current place".I was looking to see that included in the reflection,but it was missing.Overall,however,it was a good reflection inspite of the missing ingredient.</div>
