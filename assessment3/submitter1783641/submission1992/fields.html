    <h1>Submission 1992 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1783641, session_user_id: 46d9e3e398be78c76261de8553590486442c05ae)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The role of risk management in the game was to use knowledge (research) protection and insurance to protect the development (building and upgrading pods) take into consideration resources (time and money). I made a lot of choices from balance among risk management tools (using them with the same priority), choose not to buy insurance and increase my protection, choose to sacrifice the development or to stop the development using money to increase risk management by buying knowledge or increase protection or buy best insurance to take risk of shock missing. Each strategy in the game has a cost so sometime you can buy insurance and at the end you do not use it or increase unnecessary your protection or build pods but with weak risk management and at the end the shock will come and destroy them.  The preparation for the risk affect the development at any stage and especially in the medium term( after some time). <br /><br />2) I played the game more than once, for the first time I did not have good knowledge about the development (update of pods) and research. I was wasting too much time in research). The second time I reduced the time allocated for research and increase a bit my wealth. At the end, some time when my insurance is unused I stopped increasing my protection at the level required by the severity of the shock, so in the case where the is a shock I can use my insurance.<br /><br />3)  I think that we can improve the game by making it more realistic. My suggestion is that we can first  distinguish the type of shock such as drought, flood, job, etc. second develop a combination of different risk management strategies that fit well with the shock ( in which the player will have to provide his choice depending on the shock) then after that we can introduce the severity of the shock so that the player can use his wisdom to determine the type of insurance to buy, the level of production and the type of pod to develop ( the type of pod now can be related to the type of predominant or regular shock). We can also add the coping measure as well.<br /><br />Thank you</div>
