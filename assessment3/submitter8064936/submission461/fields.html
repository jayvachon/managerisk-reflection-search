    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Mostly, it's only when you see danger coming that you realise the need to protect yourself from the shock. The role of risk management made clear that if you don't protect yourself through gaining knowledge of the chance and the severity of the comet hitting, your work on developing your buildings will suffer proportionally to the missing knowledge, protection and insurance. Of course, you can't always have all you want. That's why your rate of development decreases for a period of time, in order to pay for the insurance (I usually bought the insurance at the beginning of the game. 2nd level - 25%, 3rd level -50%, 4-5 - 75%), and increasing your protection. But the outcomes of such a temporary loss are greater than their neglecting. I can't compare the superiority of either insurance or protection, since I played only 1 game; but I can say that for me, insurance was on the second plan, even though I bought it first. I didn't want to risk the huge damage a severe comet would cause for developing 1 or 2 building. I'm sure it would've cost me much more in the end. And so, I put my emphasis on protection. Even though it diminishes your rate of development, when a comet hits, the damage done is less than without protection, or even none, and the money difference from a 50% and 5% can then be reinvested in developing your buildings, buying better insurance, and/or improving your current level of protection. I guess the incentive to get through as many levels as you can, pushes you to risk in favour of the development. I thought of strategising my actions as follow. As long as a comet didn't have a 40+ chance of hitting and severeness of 3 bars, I continued developing, knowing that my insurance and protection are more than enough to have no damage, or subsequently very little reparation. But if the comet had a very high level of severeness, even with a small chance of hitting, I worked on protection, knowing that even if it doesn't hit now, so I will be both prepared in advance and having the opportunity to develop the building without losing anything when the next one came. I can therefore say that thinking ahead and rationalising that the cost you pay now, will save you more than 100% of the money invested plays a key role on how people approach risk management.<br /><br />I have no guesses what I would've done differently, because my strategy allowed me to receive 10/10 points from the first try. Therefore I would have to play the game more times, applying different strategies, cutting off the ones that don't work, because with every level you can adopt a new plan, and so there are tens of strategies to chose between.<br /><br />For the place I live in, I would add one thing. I would put the number of people that inhabit that planet or living in those houses. The number would rise, the more developed a house is. This would give the player more responsibility and he can attribute the losses of lives to the real life, where such things happen everyday. By that I hope that the player will pay more attention to insurance and protection, seeing that lives depend upon him (even though imaginary ones). He will also realise that one type of damage does not affect only a specific group of people, but every single one (systemic risk), realising that you must act not only when it affects you, because you will also need help later.</div>
