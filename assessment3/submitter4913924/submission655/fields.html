    <h1>Submission 655 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4913924, session_user_id: 82416a4e420c890c1a0bdd3271a9567470701fb4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk
management in the game is too maximize development while maintaining a balance
between protection, insurance and research. The main objection is too develop
the property as fast as possible to maximize the profits and returns, however
without the proper protection and adequate insurance the development of the
ipods are at risk to damage and subsequent loss. Research is important since it
reveals statistics with the severity and probability of a strike. With this
information, the developer has the knowledge to prepare for the comet; ensure
adequate protection and insurance if severity and probability of a strike is
high or else continue to build the ipods if the probabilities are low. I found
that it was a must to have good insurance coverage as in the event of a comet
strike the cost of repairs were low and much faster to execute. Medium
protection also kept repair cost and repair time low and in many cases escaped
damage altogether. The more time spent at risk preparation the more the
development suffered, so therefore it was crucial that focus was on the
development and to maintain the right balance of research, protection and
insurance to cope with the potential damage from the comets.<span><br /><br />
During
the first few attempts at the game, I spent too much time analyzing the comets,
keeping too much of a cash reserve and thus ran out of time in level 3. I
changed my approach to get development started quickly, maintained a low cash
reserve to maximize the development, purchased the maximum insurance and
increased the protection when a comet with high potential for damage was
approaching. This approach got me into level 4 of the game.</span></p>

<span>I would
keep the game as is but would add an automatic warning device to alert the
developer when the severity and probability of a comet strike exceeds a set
threshold. This way the developer could spent more time focusing on built and
upgrading the ipods and focus on increasing protection as required.</span><br /><br /><br /></div>
