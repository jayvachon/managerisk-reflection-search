    <h1>Submission 1525 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1358736, session_user_id: 8ba37e017631ab8f4338149040f0206ec8c7ddb4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management, in the Risk Horizon Game, is the method that the player can employ in order to identify the different sets of risks, priorities, and solutions in order to come up with a strategic method in filling up the development meter in order to progress to the next level. The game is a good example of risk management at work, wherein each decision comes with its own consequences and trade-offs. </p><p>Spending time on researching sometimes made the probability of it hitting the pods lesser, as well as having the knowledge of its severity, gave me clues on how much level of protection should be employed to avoid damages. However, researching took a lot of the time which made it harder to gather enough protection to match the severity of the incoming comet. Also, the issue to build more pods or upgrade existing pods rose which raised the important question of quantity over quality. I sometimes had to forego building new pods in order to upgrade higher and then find the balance between which existing pods should be upgraded and how much should be spent on protection. Although, not ideal in reality, I sometimes bought insurance as a last resort when an incoming comet had high probability and severity. Development was a bit slow with this overall technique and it took a while for my choices to make me an impact in my development.</p><p>Playing the game more than once made me discover different ways and combinations in which I could make the development grow steadily while being able to gather information, have protection and upgrades. After the second round, I realised that spending time on research made the meter move faster and also gave lessened damages from getting hit through community connections. I also realised that it is important to have your protection on high, regardless if the severity is low or not. Sometimes, employing insurance made the price of having to rebuild pods half of what it would actually cost, therefore giving me the opportunity to upgrade, build another or buy more protection. Likewise, in the real world, knowledge, protection, and insurance are really important when facing risks. Having and knowing how to use these three harmoniously is imperative to risk management.</p><p>If a game such as this would be applied to where I’m from, it would be a game about rain and flooding. Aside from infrastructures, I would add people to the game in which the player would have to decide when the right time is for them to evacuate the area. Flooding has been a great concern in our region and although certain measures and infrastructure have been employed, sometimes reluctant property owners have become a risk when it comes to this matter. To find a way to properly address this through risk management would be helpful in saving lives.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p>
