    <h1>Submission 1787 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8186530, session_user_id: 890a7d38c40a636c127cb833059abc99e0850002)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to protect Alora from comets (shocks) and cope with the damage when they hit, while also developing the community. The different choices that had to be made to achieve this were to raise the island (protection), research the comets approaching so as to minimize severity of their damage (knowledge), or purchase insurance to minimize the amount damage and repair costs when they hit. Raising the island cost money and time, and put development on hold; researching the comets was time-consuming and often took time away from planning or advancing pods; and purchasing insurance cost a significant amount of money that could have been put towards development. All three had an immediate effect in terms of their cost but a later, and usually larger, effect in terms of benefit or pay-off. In regards to choices, only one of the three could be pursued at a time, and the order in which they were pursued greatly impacted development and the player’s success in advancing to the next level. For example, in some levels it would have been possible to raise the island while you were still approaching the development goal, while in most levels it was only wise to do so after you reached your development goal and had extra savings/green to spare in case a comet hit and damaged your pods. Another choice that often had to be made was level of insurance - if a comet was approaching and likely to hit and damage your island, yet you could only afford the first level of insurance, it was best to purchase it but if you later wanted to upgrade to the highest level, you had to pay the full amount of the highest level, rather than the difference between the level you already had and the new one you were purchasing. Having played the game more than once, the first few times I assumed the best form of risk management would be to raise the island so as to prevent comets from hitting and damaging Alora at all. I didn’t realize how much it cost or how likely some comets were to hit and so I never advanced past the second or third level. After the first few times, the game became more stressful as I learned to appropriately balance the amount of time and money I spent on each of the three resources. Oftentimes, I learned that it would be wisest to purchase insurance first then research the closest comet as much as possible and make sure my developments were in green before I attempted to raise the island - there were a few times when I didn’t even get to raise the island at all during the level.This really helped me understand the concept and possible disadvantages of behavioral biases. If I could change one simple thing about the game, it would be the community connections part. I would make it so it would not only be tied to research, but was instead a general part of the game also somehow tied to protection and insurance. Also, I would try to make it so that it is not all or nothing - for example, I would vary the damage so that not all pods/communities are damaged completely or at all. The game would be too overwhelming if each pod had its own form of insurance, research and/or protection, but it would still be helpful to make the point that not all communities are impacted equally and that not all communities collaborate in the same ways.</div>
