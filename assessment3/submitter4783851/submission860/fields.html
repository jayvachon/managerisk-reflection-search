    <h1>Submission 860 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4783851, session_user_id: cec0d5d09bec42613523bf9049e4bf14bcc11fda)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game was to show that despite some risks not recurring  so often we may be tempted to neglect or have short memory of their recurrence  or we might even forget that the risk is there.Risk management gives you the ability to  build resilience when a risk occurs , you can be able to recover from the shock and it will also  help in rebuilding the aftermath of a calamity or a risk by encouraging the usage of other tools like for example early preparation which gives  which gives people the ability to to cope better afterwards unlike when its a surprise shock .Risk also includes preparation which entails knowledge ,being informed on the risk and using the information to make better  judgements or even putting in place measure that can influence both the impact or probability of the shock.<br />Despite the risk of a meteorite being minimal purchasing the insurance helps in confronting and coping with the after effects of the damages caused  inform of rebuilding or repairs.Because of the large damage caused by the risk, families and communities come  together to share the risk which can help in overcoming  obstacles .In aftermath of a risk many questions are asked and different views and opinions have to be heard after which actions and resolutions will be made that will in future hinder the same risk having the same impact,measures will be put in place to protect both lives and property example building away from shores to avoid tsunamis or enforcing drills in schools and an early warning system.<br />After the occurrence  when everything is stabilizing  there will be expenses to be incurred by the people so that in future  the risk can be managed well,the trade off is you pay for insurance now not knowing when the risk will occur which many people people tend to shy away from doing through  procrastination but this can be overcome by having information available to the people so that they can be able able to make decisions based on real facts they have to confront.<br />I would have played the game differently by increasing the percentage of insurance which can give me a more stable build foundation ,for the more you invest in risk management the quicker and on a lesser scale the shock will be,the  returns may also be captured over along period of time which means with time the  analysis can be formulated  to measure which of this mitigation or risk reduction measures are cost effective.<br /></div>
