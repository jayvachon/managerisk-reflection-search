    <h1>Submission 833 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5750349, session_user_id: 1add440587ed690b311a56d137f56be8efa99dab)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The horizon faced numerous risk, financial, environmental natural disasters and many others with identical chances of turning into a huge crises. Comets that flew in from the sky and infrastructure development were some of the few portfolios to consider. Poor management of these risks would certainly develop inevitable crises on the horizon.
Properly managing such risk saw the horizon escape all the possible crises, but rather turning them into opportunities. Utilizing these opportunities contributed to the development and accumulation of wealth. Properly acquiring knowledge on the comets that threatened the horizon through research provided lots of information TO ENHANCE BETTER preparation thereby increasing resilience and protection against the shocks.
Playing the game improved my understanding on the importance of knowledge acquisition in solving problems. Effective research on potential shocks solves about 40% of the possible cost in damage that a community could possibly suffer from any risk. In the game I realized a possibility to develop more protection against threats after researching and obtaining confirming information on the approaching risk. I could conserve lots of resources and also raise the appropriate protection in required measurement making necessary preparation ahead of the threat.
Proper and effective networking was another way of minimizing the weight of crises. It is very important to act fast and accurately in other to beat the effects of all shocks. There are some threats that appear abruptly leaving the horizon with little time to make proper preparations. The good thing about this type of development is the ability to test the strengths of whatever systems set in place to counter any shock that appears with such a pace. From playing the game and progressing through the levels, I had total control with a good insurance plan and adequate funds to raise protection against such shocks only after suffering similar threats at the previous levels. This strength was only identified when I was able to cope with the shocks received from the threats already encountered.  
Development was affected in lots of ways throughout my attempts to lessen the impacts of the incoming shocks. There was an immediate loss in resources but an increase in revenue after threats are dealt with from claims in the insurance packages purchased. There were instances where I began to construct new structures even when I knew greater shocks were advancing at faster rate. That management approach was entirely wrong since protection was not heightened due to the absence of resources. It was only appropriate for me to continue with my development goals only when I had built great resilience through proper research and heightened protective structures backed with good insurance packages. It is always better to focus on development when better protective schemes are instituted to cater for any incoming shock.
The game has a very good way of introducing any player into carefully managing risks whiles improving on developmental plans. But I I think the introduction of comets made it an unlikely threat to consider. Situations presented in the course of playing the game are real and they all reflect on real issues in our everyday activities. In choosing a threat for such a game, I will suggest an everyday environmental threat like storms, tsunami, hurricane and earthquakes be presented. In doing so the player gets to relate more with the possibility of facing the threat seen. One threat that will perfectly fit into that of my community is rainstorms. Rain storms are a major to my community. Many houses are destroyed when we are visited with such threats. A lot are rendered homeless and lots of households are thrown into poverty.
