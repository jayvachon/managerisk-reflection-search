    <div class="field-value">All in all, extensive and thorough reflection of the exercise. However, for added clarity, it would help a lot (!) to divide the text - and thus, the thought process - into paragraphs. The reader is much better able to follow your line of argument if you give him *breaks* - both visually in the form of some more space(s), as well as to better structure and possibly also listing various arguments or parts of your learning experience. 

(Online, one might sometimes find the abbreviation *tldr*, i.e. too long, didn't read. However, even longer texts will - rightfully! - appear more manageable and better structured with a well-applied use of paragraphs.) </div>
