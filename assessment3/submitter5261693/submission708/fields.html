    <h1>Submission 708 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5261693, session_user_id: 8bd058cf9bcc588cd22a83b20254b3bc6b2a10da)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in
the game is to mitigate losses and damages to pods ensuing from the waves
caused by falling comets that careen into the adjacent water and foster
community development. I made choices in knowledge about the risk regarding its
severity, probability of the comet hitting (occurrence); Protection measures to
confront the shocks would in turn be guided/informed by the severity and occurrence
probability of the risk; basing on the protection measures knowledge about the
risk parameters of occurrence and severity in choose an economical insurance
cover. All these I did conscious of the relevant costs to make a trade â€“ off
with further development of the pods. With preparation I was able to gauge and
manage the shocks resiliently and pod development continued steadily or with
repairable damages.</p>

<p>I played the game more than once,
every time I repeated, I would pay more attention to research in order to know the
extent risk, work on protection measures proportional to risk magnitude, buy
insurance and then develop the pods. From the game, I learnt to optimize between
knowledge, protection, insurance and direct investment in development.</p>

<p>In Uganda where I live, diseases like
AIDS, malaria etc. are common and I would propose the following risk management
choices</p>

<p><b>Knowledge</b>: research about the causes and prevention measures of the
diseases in question</p>

<p><b>Protection:</b> Invest in preventive measures according to prevalence
of the causes</p>

<p><b>Insurance:</b> buy medical insurance in regard to magnitude of the
threat after discounting it with preventive measures</p></div>
