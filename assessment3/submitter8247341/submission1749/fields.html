    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the Risk Horizon game the risk was the shooting stars ad the risk management was by building connected units to support each other and to support the land also by insurance according to the level needed, and that was my strategy of protection. preparation for risk affects development all the time but the benefit will be gained after the risk happens.<br />I played the game more than one time, and each time I change something. the first time I just tried to get knowledge. after that, I started to plan eg. I manage my money according to my needs, I got insurance for each level according to my performance.<br />If I'm tasked with developing a new version of the game that will better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live will took advantage of mineral resources enjoyed by my country to establish an infrastructure to protect people in times of crisis such as earthquakes.</div>
