    <div class="field-value">The reflection is nice with the experience of the game and the opinions, lessons and reviews from the writer. 
The key good point in this reflection is that the writer - player does not only tell the viewers about the experience but also the lessons he learn via the game. He gave cleared and strong examples to demonstrate his points and that makes people understand how he absorbed the knowledge of risk management through the game.
For most of the point, he gave the examples and opinions, which is a good thing. However, for few things, he just stated his opinions and didn't tell why - it will create the confusion for viewers. For instance, he stated that he always bought a minimum insurance at the early stage of each level. Why the minimum? Not the maximum or intermediate? Otherwise, the reflection is good and well-organized!</div>
