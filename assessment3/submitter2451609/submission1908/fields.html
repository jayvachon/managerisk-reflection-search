    <h1>Submission 1908 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2451609, session_user_id: c491adfd869f381b13a229c10a322913833eb382)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Acquiring relevant knowledge about probable damages, insuring these possible damages and securing sufficient protection were the essential instrumental tools to ensure consistent development of the village. Tradeoffs consisted mainly of allocating money between investing in upgrading, full insurance or higher protection. Striking good balance between these three were the key to development. Preparation was my most relied on tool, because it allowed me to concentrate more in the upgrades while being safe on the risk side. While preparation was short term cost with benefits occurring later in the game it saved a lot of money and time from post -damage reparations and constructions. <br /><br />2.  Yes I played the game several times till I could no longer advance beyond the 5th level. After the initial failures I understood the importance of better protection and hence paid more attention on setting up good protection from the outset of the game. I learned that while building (upgrading) I had to intensively survey the passing comets for risk profiles. Acquisition of the knowledge enabled me to adjust the level of my protection in timely manner hence avoid devastating calamities. Essential it was not to rely just on full insurance coverage. Instead of curing the post accident damages which cost both money and time, prevention via adequate protection saved substantial financial resources and also eased the time constraint.<br /><br />3.  I would add more uncertainty factor into incoming benefits from the plants. In the game it was 100 percent predictable and stable over time, whereas in real life scenarios it is hardly ever possible to fully predict income from the projects. Adding uncertainty into financial profits from the production of the plants would introduce another dimension of risk and hence require risk management in that dimension as well. That meaning financial risk management. All in all, however the game was quite challenging and assembled the main components of risk management that we encountered in the lectures and also the readings. It was nice to see the application of these principles into a funny yet difficult game like this. Thank you for all of your efforts!!<br /></div>
