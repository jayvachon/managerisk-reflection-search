    <div class="field-value">You have done a commendable job of extrapolating the lessons of the game into real life scenarios. However, your suggestions for introducing some new aspects into the game could have been more constructive. However, this particular disagreement is on a personal basis and has in no way affected my grading for your assessment of the game.
Cheers!</div>
