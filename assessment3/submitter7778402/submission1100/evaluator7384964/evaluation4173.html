    <div class="field-value">The key strength in this reflection is that it highlights for each action when there is a the sense or need of it, and when not. I feel tempted to try the game again with these insights. This reflection could be improved a tiny bit in only one respect: the comparison with "risk management choices" could be more in depth. Personally I don't agree with the conclusion that in the game all risks are controllable (but they are manageable, yes), but that is up to debate. Nice reflection. Good insights. Well done.</div>
