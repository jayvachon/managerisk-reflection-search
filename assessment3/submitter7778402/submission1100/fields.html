    <h1>Submission 1100 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7778402, session_user_id: 28a6ea8d23e81855fe2941c24bd27915df66427c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is all about making the right decisions, setting priorities, and foreseeing problems before they occur. A strong proof of that is that we all played the game more than once, and every time we get a better score than the previous one. This proves how good we are dealing with risks and obstacles if we know their consequences and the actions required to reduce their impact.<br />The major risk here is caused by comets, and we need to deal with it with the following constraints in mind:<br />1- Time<br />2- Financial Resources<br />3- Community development<br /><br />In order to face these problems, the following solutions could take place:<br />1- Protection<br />2- Research<br />3- Insurance<br /><br />According to my experience in this game, I noticed that It is always best know what kinds of risks we expect. Comets come in different colors, each has its specifications. For some research (which costs nothing but has an opportunity cost) could do the jobs, but for others protection needs to be done. Insurance is not worth it until we reach a point where we reallyÂ cant avoid the problem, this is only we look for fixing solutions rather than preventive solutions.<br /><br />This is what I learned from playing the game more than once. The better you understand the risks, the more knowledgeable you are about the solutions that make sense. Community strength is important, financial resources are also important, but most important is knowing what is coming and what works for it.<br />Relying less on insurance (which is a waste of resources I discovered) and doing as much as possible as long as there are no comets to research is key. Also when we have numerous numbers of comets, and thus not much time to conduct research on all of them, I think investing in protection would be the smartest solution.<br /><br />But the thing is that the risks in this game are all manageable and controllable, I believe we should have other risks that are not expected, cannot be predicted, and needs different type of risk mitigation. Something like unexpected earthquake, or sudden lose of financial resources... Something would make the game unfair but more realistic.<br /><br /></div>
