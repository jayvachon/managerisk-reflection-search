    <div class="field-value">1) The key strength of this reflection is that the the way reflection started regarding the role of risk management in game, which is quiet impressive.
2) I think there was the sufficiency of time and resources in the game because three minutes were enough to play each level and each time resources were increasing after 8 to 10 seconds. So these points are irrelevant and mentioning them in the reflection was unnecessary.   </div>
