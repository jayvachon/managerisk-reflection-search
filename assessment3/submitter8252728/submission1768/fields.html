    <h1>Submission 1768 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8252728, session_user_id: 1544491504a97ec589e0179255907c95665a26c5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game is making development coordination effectively by using main tools which are knowledge, protection and insurance. To confront and indentify risk succesfully bring many opportunities when the crises occur. If the risks are identifed,researced and prioritized before the disaster,we can understand shocks and potencial outcomes of them.<br />When i was playing the game, firstly i did try to build many pods all at once.  After building community, I focused on researching the incoming comets. Researcing is one of the most important tool of this game.  Because when i gave my full attention to the meteors, i could evaluate the severities and chances of hit of them. It means researcing and getting knowledge about risk helped me to decide how to act. When the chance of hit was low, i did not waste my resource for the most expensive insurance. While i was striking a balance between research and insurance, i tried to keep the protection at an optimum level. <br />When i played the game once, i did try to upgrade pods immidiately but it did not worked so well. Without researching and protecting it only reduced my resource and caused serious damages. After first try , i decided to change my strategy. if the chance of hit is high, i focused on insurance and protection. When i got no damage after the hit, i started to upgrade my pods's desing and beauty to make greener my development bar which was on the left side of game screen.  I would like to mention that the community connection is also important for development. More pods facilitated more communication and support in community as a kind of insurance.<br />If I were tasked to develop a new version of
the risk management game, I prefer to make the game more interactive. It would be
playable with all the course attenders interactively and we would build our
own cities with supporting each other even with creating a discussion channel. Every household would have a role and duty for a while and it would change in some period. Moreover this kind of social development on the game may teach us how important
the community connection in terms of risk management. And also i would propose to include public policy,civil society and private sector in this game. With those people's of risk management, development of community against risks would be more resilient and prosper.<br /><br /></div>
