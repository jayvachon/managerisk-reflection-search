    <div class="field-value">An excellent evaluation of the lessons learned from the game and the author exhibits an understanding of the key aspects of risk management taught in the course to this point.  A good point on learning from previous disasters: this would definitely make the game more interesting and would reflect more of a "real world" understanding of disasters.

The author covers all of the main points and offers a clear and concise response to the questions posed.  I do not feel that much would be needed to make it better.</div>
