    <div class="field-value">very good account of how he changed strategies to cope with disasters- starting by investing too much in building vs protecting and insurance, and changing in investing more in protection and insurance as he failed. Also very good suggestion to include in future versions of game "soft" aspects as corruption and bureaucracy, not only resources, which could be balanced with investing in transparency and capacity building. 
It is a good piece, the language could be improved and some minor grammatical mistakes, that is the only defect.</div>
