    <h1>Submission 1169 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7911324, session_user_id: 545b732fa07e8691a214f281a8c8fb87342be1e7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game aims to learn how to manage a risk effectively and successfully. In this essay, I will briefly explain the role of risk management and each factor of risk management in this game. Next, I will major relationship between Development and other factors of Risk Management. Lastly, there will be a suggestion toward the better developed game.<br /><br />First, the main risk is comets and a risk management means that how to prevent from being damaged and how to cope with the situation after getting damaged in this game. Before getting damaged, there are several tools to prevent from being damaged such as research, protection and insurance. However, since every tool costs some money, I should prioritize and invest effectively. This prioritization is very imporant esepcially in the beginning of the game. If I have enough insurance and protection level, I do not have to worry about the comets with low severity since it won't affect that much to my Alora. However, if you do not make enough research, my information cannot be accurate enough, which means that I cannot prevent effectively. That is why all facotrs are important and choosing among them is also important when we prepare to protect ourselves from the risk. <br />Also, after being damaged, there is only one way to lessen damage which is building community connections with others. However, as there is the concept of "golden time" in medical field to save injured people, I have to build community as soon as possible. This shows that when people experience natural disaster in Chile, Bangladesh and others, it is important to build communication among city, nation, and international community quickly to cope with the situation effectively.<br /><br />Second, every facor of risk management affects Development in various ways, which is the main point of this course. As protection level goes high, Development is also intesified since there is no need to put more efforts and money into the comets with low level of severity and possibility to hit. This means that I do not have to worry about those comets any more and I can explore more chances with those stability. This stability does not mean being stagnant which we have to avoid. This stability maans the developed and better situation I can enjoy with being prepared for the future risk. Also, research is very important to enhance development since when I research more and more, my future becomes the things I can forecast easily. This means that my future won't be affected by systematic risk any more, which menas that my life gets developed more.<br /><br />Lastly, it will be the better game if there is any possibility to control wealth in the game. In the existing game, there is no way I can control the wealth. Sometimes it goes up but I cannot forecast well. If there is any possiblity I can controll them with upgrading and using pods in some ways or using development bar, it will be the more effective way to show how I can prepare for the better future with managing the risk effectively. For example, people take a risk with technologies with a risk management system, which results in the better future with more wealth. I think this concept can be absorbed in this game, too.<br /><br />To sum up, this game shows the major factors to prepare the risk and cope with the risk after getting damaged or injured. There are insurance, protection and research to prepare and community to cope with damage. Using those tools effectively and successfully, which means a risk amangement, creates the better future. <br /></div>
