    <h1>Submission 1261 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8243198, session_user_id: b11368afa39f7d6779eed56f5011e9ad2b03187c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game provided a deep insight so as to how to maintain a proper balance between the different components of risk management,without hampering the process of development.<br />In order to keep the community intact on the development path,risk management is of great essence. Because once a calamity hits,if no precautions are taken,the time and expense required to reconstruct is much more than the preparation cost of risk. Since resources were limited(money and time constraints) a proper allocation was required between research,protection,insurance and development.A trade off was required between those components which made the game challenging,realistic and interesting. Firstly i learned how to focus on those impending threats,the probability of which was higher and diverting attention from those comets which were likely to be missed. Secondly i learnt how to buy more time for coping,post the comet strikes by taking preliminary measures of researching,protecting and insurance.Researching to procure knowledge by assessment and judgment.Protection are the means to reduce the possibility of loss from any unfortunate events.Insurance by transferring the resources from good to bad times.Thus the key to proper risk management is by combining these events in the right proportion so as to make the process of coping easier.Alongside this risk management process I also learned the process of keeping development away from stagnation.<br />Though the upfront cost of risk management seemed huge,as it slowed down the process of development,yet once the comet struck,it seemed as as a huge boon.As it is said "prevention is better than cure", the recovery path seemed much easier.<br />In the first try it was difficult to get the balance right.So as i gradually proceeded,with every try i explored some new tricks which helped raise my understanding of the subject.Initially,risk management looked like a piece of cake.But in practice it is not that easy.This realization brought a graveness in the way i approached this subject.If i would focus my attention on plot development it would pose a threat on the future.If i would focus too much on prevention my development process would be stagnated.If we run out of funds neither development nor prevention would be possible,thus weakening the power to cope.This showed,how important risk management is,for the society.<br />If i were tasked with developing a new version of the game i would add more varieties of risk like an outbreak of an epidemic because in reality we are faced with not only 1 type of risk but several other kind of risks.<br />I live in a place where poor people are trapped in a vicious circle of poverty.In order to reduce that,I would like to propose some financial backups or insurance which could persuade them to take risks and improve the conditions in which they live.<br />Thus risk management can help embark on new oppurtunities and face impending threats with increased ease.It reduces ad hoc decisions and makes us wise decision makers.This is what that i can say now by my own experience.
