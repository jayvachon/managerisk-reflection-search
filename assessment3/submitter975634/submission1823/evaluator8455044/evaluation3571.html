    <div class="field-value">The key strength in this essay is you clear description of a trial-and-error approach to the game, and your understanding of possible strategies.  however, you could definitely have elaborated in regards to research, for example, its use allows the use of 'community connections' as a substitute for insurance. the use of "it" became very confusing at one point: (I tried to add it all at the same time and one by one,) i've read this 4 times, and still don't understand what you're referring to.

 To improve, treat the reader like an idiot, because your point will always make sense to you, the writer, but the reader can't read your mind. 

also, i didn't mark you down on this because it's irrelevant, but i'd give experiment with a different mindset with problemlematic situations; try predicting what will happen instead of trying out the what-ifs, it saves time and like you said, trial and error is often an approach that's too expensive in real life.</div>
