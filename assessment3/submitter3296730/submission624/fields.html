    <h1>Submission 624 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3296730, session_user_id: d88af0616eee976e98cd9bf74dd8cd535305b4a0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to teach us how to better protect and equip ourselves in case of damage while developing at the same time. <br />The choices that i made were first to protect myself at any cost by raising my platform to a minimum of 4 bars and then start build up in the innermost 2 to 3 pods so that till the time i learn hoe to benefit from the research i am in the innermost area an hence chances of being hit by the waves are the least in the inner most places. <br />Then going by the level of chances of being hit solely i would purchase insurance and wait. If the comet missed i would count as good luck and upgrade my pods and add 1 additional one in the middle and upgrade any 2 , and in hing sight it should be the 2 middle ones not the side ones so that my development is protected.<br /><br />I altered between high protection and 75 percent insurance when i was building and then maintaining minimum 5 bar protection and 50 percent insurance i upgraded my pods and added the riskiest ones. i upgraded 3 at a time . Then i saw 2 more comets and their level of severity. Luckily they wasn`t much damage. the maximum hit was 27%. And the protection bar would go lower to 4. if it went to 3 i would increase it to 4 and keep insurance to 33 % and build one more pod and upgrade 2 more pods. <br />The game like the real world has a huge element of chance. Chance is not covered by anything a 100%. <br />Hence the best way to beat ill luck is to have high level of protection  and mid levels of insurance and a wee bit of research to see any patterns and the try your luck. <br /><br />Risk affected my development in terms of financial resources and morale to  build near the ocean. i would only build near the ocean if i have 100 % protection and a basic build up as it is the cheapest to repair and maintain. <br /><br />If i were to play the game again i would try and work with 9 level of protection such that i can build up faster and then get my protection to 10 and insurance to 33%.<br /><br />I learnt that risks cant always be calculate and predicted so its better to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best and then you have some confidence to try and develop in relatively safer areas where given a certain level of protection an insurance of 33% is enough. <br /><br />In the game i didn't understand how community help and development played a role in protecting each other or how to even initiate it. So that could be made clearer with signs and levels with a graph or some other tool. <br /><br />I would like to see a change in my community by seeing better infrastructure against floods and more long term preventive actions being take by the community with the help of the state because without the help of both actions cannot succeed and damage maximizes instead of minimizing. </div>
