    <div class="field-value">This reflection illustrates mostly the choices that the student made in the Game and not really what he or she learnt from it. There was only one sentence about risk management being cost-effective that could be taken as the outcome of the learning experience. Otherwise, there was a suggestion given about how to improve the game and that I liked. I would advise the student to more explore his/her learning experience, what that game gave to that person, what did he/she learn from it - this approach would make the learning easier and helps to clarify the understanding of what risk management is for him/her.</div>
