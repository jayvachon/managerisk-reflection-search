    <h1>Submission 1377 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6904143, session_user_id: 90da8662b5445c0572385fdc33f030d9d560927d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1)</p><p>Risk management in the game was deployed to maximise
development over time and get to the next level. One had to choose between
using resources to build new pods, improve existing pod (which generate a higher
return and therefore speed up growth) or using resources to increase the knowledge
of the threat, protecting by raising the ground level or insuring against
damage. Protecting against damage meant that the colony would survive damage
and would therefor progress in the game, not having to use resources to rebuild
or repair. In turn that mean that the colony prospered as it grew quicker as
the pods were at a higher level.</p>

<p>2)</p><p>I plaid the games a few times, initially. I tried to build
as many pods as possible, but they kept getting damaged. I then focused on
minimising damage from comets, having enough sea level so the damage would be
minimal, tracking the comets that were coming and buying insurance if there was
a comet I could not buy enough defence to avoid. This meant that I very seldom
had significant damage and so my colony was able to grow a lot more. The game has
taught me the importance of the three strands of risk management: knowledge,
prevention and insurance.</p>

<p>3)</p><p>If I were to add an additional aspect to the game I would
try to add an aspect of sustainable development, maybe having two types of
development available, a cheaper form of development with quick return but side
effects of pollution or a more complex form of development that takes longer to
get going (maybe some sort of collaboration between players is required to
achieve this) that has fewer negative consequences. This would replicate some
of the choices that governments have to make about carbon pricing and the
effects on climate change.</p></div>
