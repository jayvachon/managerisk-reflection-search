    <h1>Submission 467 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6564239, session_user_id: 5deab807f8344e50652d0b72d9ff7ea748fb79c2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
essence, the Risk Horizon game nicely highlights the challenges related to the
allocation of limited resources. Any of the three ‘tools’—knowledge/research,
protection, and insurance—costs money in its application and goes at the
expense of another one. The attempt to protect yourself against the drawbacks
of a hit by matching the severity (protection) makes you lose valuable time for
developing the settlement. I began noticing the ramifications of not focusing
on developing the settlement to a sufficient degree only at a later stage
(levels 3 and 4) because the more sophisticated research stations take longer
time to build. In addition, the development of the settlement is very important
for properly predicting the severity and probability of the hit. I had to
experience a few times that I thought I was prepared but then got caught by
surprise because the prediction was unreliable. Clearly, this shows that all of
those three tools and strategies are intertwined and need to be pursued in a
holistic approach. </p>

<p>I
played the game more than once since I admittedly did not manage to get to
level 4 in my first attempts. I somewhat relied less on insuring the settlement
in my latter—successful—attempts because I felt it was possible to develop the
settlement more quickly by protecting it rather than rebuilding it at a cheaper
rate. But obviously this was only my personal approach. However, at times it is
inevitable to use the insurance, in particular when the level of protection
couldn’t match the severity of the hit. In these cases I tried to buy the
insurance shorty before the hit. I realised that it is extremely important to
remain flexible with regard to the application of the tools and seize the
opportunities in the respective situations. Furthermore, it became quite
obvious that one cannot neglect any of the three tools highlighting the
importance of an integrated approach to risk management. </p>

<p> I
think an interesting change or addition to the game would be to incorporate
other stakeholders, such as other households or banks that can form a community
and share the burden of managing risk. Since in real life your choices often
depend on the choices of other—or are taken jointly—this might bring the game
yet another step closer to the reality of managing risk. Hence I believe that
this change would better represent the risk management choices that matter in
the place where I (and arguably all of us) live: a global community. </p></div>
