    <h1>Submission 1824 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5706078, session_user_id: 47935facab9d362d4fc937506126f486a3e877d6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk management game was designed to help us to understand the
choices faced by policy makers with regard to the distribution of resources
into the areas of research, protection, insurance and development in the
management of risk. Due to $ level being directly related to development, too much investment in any one or all of the
three risk management areas, will result
in the stall of further development, due to lack of funds. This means that in
the long run you will not have the development level to afford the necessary
risk management strategy. This acts as a self-perpetuating problem, without
adequate development you do not have the necessary resources for risk
management, however, without risk management, the outcome of shocks can be devastating.
Therefore, the trade-offs relate to using as few resources as late as possible
in reacting to known shocks before they happen. This allows for the development
of Alora, in turn, greater income generation, in order to afford the cost of
risk management in the future.</p>

<p><span>The only way to do this was through research.  By knowing the severity of the comet and
calculating expected duration until impact you are able to manage accordingly.
Weighing up the imminence of the impact with the time that it takes to build up
protection directly and research for better indirect protection through greater
communication.</span></p>

<p>Initially I spent the first part of the money buying pods, and used
their income to buy the highest grade insurance. However, I immediately
realised that in using the initial income generated on insurance and not on a
pod upgrade, meant that I was behind in development terms and struggled in
future development. I then took the strategy of researching the first comet to
see what their likely damage would be and build up the protection to one above.
As this was the lower levels 2-3, it didn’t take up too much time or too many
resources. I then continued to investing in development. This meant that the $
would come in at a greater rate allowing me to invest in protection a lot more
easily. The main issue was fast comets with high impact and severity probability impact. In these cases I would calculate the time it would take
to build up to sufficient protection, both direct and indirect. Once you get to
the second level, you should have at least two blue bars of protection, three
is ideal. This allows you to deal with any shocks without using insurance. I found that investing in insurance should only be a last resort if protection will not match impact.</p>

<p>This relates directly to policy makers decisions on how much they
spend up front on risk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but
may not hit) or to spend on other development priorities. As mentioned in the
reading, the decision of how much to invest in better preparation depends, in
part, on the probability of a similar event happening in the future. It is hard
to invest in things that have no seen return, therefore, if an event has occurred
and the effects have been felt, you understand the return on risk management
investment. </p><p>The only thing that I
would add to the game, is that the insurance should fluctuate in relation to
the amount of risk known (i.e. probability and severity of impact) and the
amount of protection a player has. Insurance underpins much of the global
market and within the context of financial investment is based on these two
factors. </p></div>
