    <div class="field-value">This is a completely honest reflection; which is a good thing. I guess since you are not a gamer, you would have preferred if there was an alternative - such as providing solutions to hypothetical case studies. However, in my opinion I think the game was not one that needed much of a 'gaming' flair. Nonetheless, you are free to have your opinion and my biased mind has in no way affected the grading for your reflective piece. 
Honest and a pleasant read!</div>
