    <h1>Submission 1601 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8289841, session_user_id: ed46f5e2a5e2911248fd5123640e059e9f0d6553)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk Horizon game I an interested game.  It helped me to know how and why risk
management is important for development. </p>

<p>First of all, risk management help player can reduce the
damage from the risk, they still have resources for growing. In this game, risks
are meteors.  </p>

<p>To manage the risks, I used three tools: research, protection
and insurance. I often bought insurance when I started every level, and after
that, with each meteors,  I researched
and used the result of the research to decide about my next protection. </p>

<p>                Insurance
covered part of my repair cost and replace part of my lost development. With protection,
my pods were prevented form being damaged. And with each reseach, I received
more time to create community connections right before the comet hits, helping
boots my protection. </p>

<p>So, if my task is developing a new version of the game, I support
that the game need detail information about damage of each meteors. It will
help player in deciding which tool of risk management they will use.</p></div>
