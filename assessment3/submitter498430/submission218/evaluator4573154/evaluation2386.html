    <div class="field-value">This reflection about the game was highly structured and organised. The student answered the questions by going straight to the point. Moreover, the content shows a very good understanding of  the video lectures, ,where all the important terms where correctly used. I was interested to read about the strategy used to achieve the specific level. In my opinion, the reflection would be better if the student described more his experience and the strategy he or she used. But in general, I think the refection is really good.</div>
