    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">To my point of view,the role of risk management is kind of like a  backup guy to check and monitor always to maintain the whole system goes well,<br />it's an very important role ,a little bit like the government. It has the responsibilities .Knowledge is basic,cause some risks happens we can predicted but but we cant stop it to happen.<br /><br />That's why i found the protection and insurance is so esstential in the whole progress. If natural disaster happens ,the best things we can do is the reduce the damage to the lease level. To react fast is also an  important lesson i learn from the game.No matter what happened ,and how bad is it,we dont have time just check and sorrow,react is the first solution.<br /><br />I kept playing this game until i lost in in the third round,I kind of enjoy playing it.To keep playing it is just like join the knowledge we learned from the course into practice,like we r in the contral of this system and we have responsibility to keep it safe and goes well.If you stop on half way,it's gonna be quite hard to continue the thinking, thinking is very useful in playing this game,we put ourselves into that role and play it with that role, to think not just an individual but someone hold the responsibility and we should think whole .check each step and make sure things go well.<br /><br />The insurance coverage,the community coorperation ,how to maintain the pods ,to raise the level of the pods ,check the risks from outside ,the growing level.AN interesting is that i am learning strategy management at the same time,to combine these two together and put it into practice is interesting.<br /><br />Insurance is the most important part i learned ,,In the game ,I would rather buy the most expence one cause i can cover more ,i am sure i wouldnt do that before in real life ,but now i ;ve changed my mind.ONly when risks happens you know how important insurance is and would rathere devoted more into it.I  think this works not for a country or groups also for individuals. it's remind me and i should consider my owe insurance not just for now and for the future.<br /><br />The community,the community would help a lot when risk happens ,they r much near ,like neighbors. when risks occurs and you need very urgent help ,to find someone near by is very important.  the communities provided the chances of this.When risks occurs ,especially natural disaster, time is life,  to rescue people you need react as fast as you can ,the communities near by offered their help and would save much more lives at that time.<br /><br />To  keep the information sharing,and have certain meeting with the communities is a good way ,you can keep in touch and keep the update ,if some unpredictable happened, may be the communities or your neighbour notice early than you.<br /><br />If there ;s a new vision of the game, i think to connect people who play it gonna be better,like communities.They can sharing information while playing it and keep the update of the going,or if there are group playing,like two or three students can play it together ,it help the team work and coorperation in risk management process.this may need the game more complicated ,you have to management the risk in the game and at the same time ,to discuss and team work with others ,may be your classmate , to make decisions ,to aware each others resonsibility and the whole process of discussion .This is more interesting and we can learn from each other.Cause people play it with diffrent background</div>
