    <div class="field-value">Great critical thinking! that gives me a deeper view of risk management concepts discussed in the course. You understood the course very well and i like your ideas especially what you described as 'multidimentional view' to risk management. 
However, i think a simplier writing style would have helped to better express your ideas. Keeping it straighforward would have enhanced the clarity of the essay. So i would gradly encourage to keep improving your english. But i got the depth of your message! Keep up! :)</div>
