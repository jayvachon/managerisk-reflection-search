    <div class="field-value">Overall this is a great reflection. The student has clearly understood the focus of the game and taken the time to genuinely reflect on his or her experiences. One of the strengths of this reflection is the convincing argument that in the risk management world you need to find the middle-ground. You cannot focus your resources on too few or too many areas if you want to succeed. To improve this reflection, the student could re-consider the area of 'coping'. The game incorporates the coping element through enabling the user to click on the glowing houses in order to reduce and sometimes negate the damage all together.  Investment in research extends the time the user has to cope with the disaster.</div>
