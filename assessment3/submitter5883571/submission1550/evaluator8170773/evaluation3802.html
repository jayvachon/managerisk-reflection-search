    <div class="field-value">The article seems to have failed to elaborate on questions 2 and 3 (respectively, what would have been done differently had the game been played more than once and the one aspect of the game that could have been changed). Additionally, it tends to focus especially and excessively on generic learning, and as such, the concept of induction has not been applied: that is, no connection between specific points learnt from the game and overall conceptual inferences has been established. </div>
