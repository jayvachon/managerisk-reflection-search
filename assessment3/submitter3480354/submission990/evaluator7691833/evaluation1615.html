    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is the awareness of how the player changed and learned during the game play.  This reflection could have been better if the writer was more mindful of the third question.  While there is quite a bit of creative thought involved in the recommendation for game changes it doesn't necessarily address the question because the question asked for a "one simple" upgrade suggestion.  Overall, this was a good reflection. </div>
