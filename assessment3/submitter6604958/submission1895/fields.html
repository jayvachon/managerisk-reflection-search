    <h1>Submission 1895 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6604958, session_user_id: a7e24c6e83158095edd8c20aa98cc5adbb4337de)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of
risk management is determinant to do the best use of resources and to reach the
higher level of community development. </p>

<p>I chose to
build some pods (not all) and protect them in 2 ways: insurance (at medium
level) and upgrading them in the way of my economic resources allowed. I used
as much time as I have to invest in knowledge since it could give me resources
to better prepare or protect my community. The preparation made me have less
shocks and damages. And when I had it, the insurance assured me to recover
without so many expenses. </p>

<p>So risk
management was important to carry on the development of my community, without
suffering big damages that could make me recede or compromise the future. </p>

<p>I played
three times and at the first time I was just investing in insurance and
protection without knowledge. So my resources ended fast and I didn’t use them
in the best way. After that, I realized that knowledge was important to obtain
more resources and to better prepare to the risk. </p>

<p>Indeed I
learnt that a better risk management is the one that combine the 3 components in
a good balance, which is something really difficult to do. </p>

<p><span>Presently
in the place where I live (Portugal), one of the biggest systemic risks is the
loss of employment. Since we are already facing it and we can’t do much to
prevent or protect us from it, I think that it would be important to learn how
confront the situation and cope with it. It’s necessary to understand the
necessity of taking risks through the pursuit of new opportunities to achieve a
future prosperity. So in the game, I would add an item to illustrate how to
confront the risk after the negative event and to seek new opportunities in new
directions with a controlled risk. </span></p></div>
