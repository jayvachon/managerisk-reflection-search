    <div class="field-value">The strength of the reflection lies in the author's delving into the details of the strenuous efforts spent in playing the game , which underscores strong sense of commitment. Moreover the other goes an extra mile to link the lesson learned during risk horizon game to the real world risk being faced: high unemployment.  Citing the need for diversity of sources of income as a safety value is another source of strength. The author notes the need for a balance, which seems pedantic as it is liable to mean different things in different situations, which is a point that I consider needs shading more light on. </div>
