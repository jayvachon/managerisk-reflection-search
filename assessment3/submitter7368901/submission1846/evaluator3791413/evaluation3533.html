    <div class="field-value">The reflection is concise and largely clear in the points made.  One gets a good sense of the student's experience with the game as they progressed from playing the first time, and how lessons learnt were implemented through choices made, as he/ she continued playing.

I think the reflection may be taken to the next level if after focussing on the actual game experience, parallels to real life situations were articulated, about concepts learned in by playing the game.  Also, the element that the student would add to the game, needed to be explaining more in the context of how it could be included to a game setting, and not just an exposition of the problem in itself.</div>
