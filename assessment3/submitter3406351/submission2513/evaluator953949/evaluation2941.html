    <div class="field-value">1. What I like the most about this reflection was the final recommendation to upgrade the current game version. I find the suggestion, “using upgraded material for the pods”, practical and simple. As we had learned in our readings simplicity is the best approach when our resources are limited. I also like the detail in the strategy used.

2. I think that the author could strengthen his/her reflection by taking those learnings and telling us about how they can be incorporated in the place he/she lives. The detailed recount of why a choice was better than another was very interesting but I will like to see it how that is applied to a more realistic setting.
