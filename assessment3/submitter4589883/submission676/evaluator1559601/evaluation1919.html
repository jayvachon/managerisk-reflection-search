    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is the ability of the author to ensure that reader fully understands the content of her/his assignment, the very good use of english and the creative idea of adding demographic criteria, which means the author understood the importantce of information and research on risk management.  However, I would suggest more laconic (less but to the point) phrases, in all parts of the assignment (also less examples) and a more conclusion-based final paragraph. An approximate grade would be 8.8/10</div>
