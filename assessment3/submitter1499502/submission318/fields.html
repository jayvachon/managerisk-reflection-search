    <h1>Submission 318 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1499502, session_user_id: 3f8d3948dfac6b9707268c7029621d4adffb1831)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this game risk management aims to take all the preventive
and coping measures available in order to foster and boost the village growth.
Since resources were limited and have to be managed between development
strategies and protection strategies I had to decide at every moment in time
whether it was best to invest in protection or insurance, or taking actions to
develop the village without protection taking the risk of exposing all the
development to the devastating effects of a meteor.  Preparation for risk affected development in
two ways; those resources devoted to research had an immediate effect when the
village was placed high enough in order to avoid the effects of the impact. Resources
devoted to insurance had effects in a second instance once the meteor has stricken
and damage the village; in this sense having insurance lowered the cost of
repairs.</p><p>I have to take more attention to connections. My focus was
to obtain the best balance between protection and development but didn’t place
as emphasis in connections. </p>

<p></p><p>The game made evident that even in situations where one is exposed
to high-frequency   high-impact events
and limited resources, growth and development can still be achieved by
carefully considering all the risk management tools and measures available. It
was also clear that risk management has to be a continuous process, in this
case involving continuous research, updating insurance according to the level
of development of the village and adapting the village elevation depending on
the data found by the research.</p><p></p><p>I live in Uruguay, a place that is not affected by
catastrophes or extreme poverty, so from my point of view I would only add to
the game the feature that the people in the village can learn about the risks
they face and the preventive measures they can take by themselves. In this game
I was acting as a sole entity – like the government – overseeing everything and
deciding upon everything, but I think it is also vital that everyone has a good
understanding of the risks so incentives are better aligned and the government
and the people of the village can work together in the implementation of risk
management and in the development of the village.  After all, if well informed, the individual is
better suit to assets his risk aversion and can make an efficient usage of risk
management mechanisms; collectively this could lead to a better implementation
of the scarce resources devoted to risk management. </p></div>
