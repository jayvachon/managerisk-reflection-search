    <div class="field-value">The reflection gave a good account of how the student learned over time to build a better risk management strategy, by understanding and taking account of the trade-offs between the different factors (time, resources, etc). To improve the reflection further the student could think about other factors to incorporate (aside from additional shocks) such as different types of communities or development, and be more explicit about the lessons for real life (i.e. beyond just the need to learn from experience).</div>
