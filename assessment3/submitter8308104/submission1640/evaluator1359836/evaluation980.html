    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the student was able to summarize his/her reflection by saying: "Main things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different ways to manage risk etc."

However, on paragraph 5, the student said he/she purchased 75% of the insurance which is in conflict with what he/she is saying on paragraph 6 - that given another chance to play the game again, the student would get enough insurance to ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damage based on previous experiences. I think if the student would clear this, this reflection will be better. Thank you.</div>
