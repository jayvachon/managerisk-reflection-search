    <h1>Submission 2572 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6148293, session_user_id: 7ee30d9c4ad43ce74e42e0ba95951054e4be5754)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role was that of making decisions about how to use resources to enhance the development of the island. It was necessary to set priorities of two main resources- time and money, either to prepare for disasters (comet hits) or to build up a more prosperous communities (building up pods). The preparation for the disasters involved also different phases, first researching on how probable and how severe would a comet hit be; second deciding upon lifting the island to protect the pods according to that impact equation; and third, purchasing an insurance to make reconstruction cheaper. It is interesting to see how although preparation for risk was achieved by "lifting" the island for protection, this measure reduced notoriously how well the "development bar" performed. Such a decision in the game gives me a very clear glimpse of what people and governments have to deal with when they seem not to make the "obvious" decisions of remaining on safe zones-- this is, focusing too much on protection would not allow enough investment in developing the pods.<br /><br />This has to do with the answer to the second question; the first times I played I failed in the first level. On the one hand because I did not realise how important it was to improve the pods (which means that as a decision-maker I missed key information about opportunities) and on the other hand because I did not manage time very well. So there is also an element here of learning as you fail; once I got the importance of not only making damage almost improbable but realised that it was necessary to take some risks and balance the budget to look for better outcomes, the results improved. And finally, there is an issue of cummulative preparation; developing the pods allows you to be better prepared for the future levels as you will have a higher revenue; buying an insurance is a time-constraint measure and you only make sure that reconstruction is not too expensive.<br /><br />And for the last question, I would allow the development of the pods to be done according to two options: one with a higher retun rate for the investment (let's say, industrial) and the other with less vulnerability to comet hits (let's say, agriculture), so the decisions upon whether or not to protect and whether or not to buy an insurance are correlated to a greater extent with those of how much time you have to achieve the development goal versus the need to mitigate the risks.<br /></div>
