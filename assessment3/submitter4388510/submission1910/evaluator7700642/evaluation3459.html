    <div class="field-value">Key strength of this reflection:
- It link risk management concept into macro level (instead on mentioning what happened during the game)

Suggestion to this reflection:
- Instead on macro level description how risk management can help, provide some example will be good.
(For instance, "preparation of the risk management was critical as the levels of damage and material and psychological responses were highly dependent of it." If student can describe a bit on psychological response highly dependent on preparation of risk management, then will be better)
