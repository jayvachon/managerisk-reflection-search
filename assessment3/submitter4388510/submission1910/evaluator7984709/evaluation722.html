    <div class="field-value">Writing too much about the process and observations during the game, this writer fails to respond to the assignment questions chronologically. The text may refer to the role of risk management in the game, but it is more focused on what the player has faced when playing the game. Different elements of risk management are described as they have been experienced in the game, but they are emphasized too much and the writer does not suggest any better alternative both for the game and for the real world. </div>
