    <div class="field-value">This reflection captures elements of the experience of role-playing a risk manager. However, it would benefit from focusing more on the particular learning mechanism provided by the game. Highlighting the trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection, insurance and how did you alter their contribution to  managing the risk as you played additional rounds would potentially improve the reflection. The reflection would also benefit from more clarity.
