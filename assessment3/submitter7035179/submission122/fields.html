    <div class="field-value">Reflection On the <strong>Risk Horizon Game</strong> :<br /><br />The Game Risk Horison is a well designed Strategy Game meant to realise the importance of Risk management in Different <br />Circumstances. The clear goal of the game was to put emphaisis on the prevention of the risk if its minimal or to mitigate it <br />in the best possible way keeping pace with constant development . To do that we had to make clear choices with the resources and fund avaliable to confroant in knowledge, protection and insurance. <br />The Game shows that a constant balance of focus and Investment in either knowledge , Protection or insurance  is to be maintained all the time while looking foreward to the development of the society in whole , also that with time the Risks tend to be more alarming and they are in increased frequency. ( as in thre game with increasing levels).<br /><br />In Alora the prime task was <strong>Development of the society</strong> : Building pods and upgrading them will increase the Development bar.<br />but the<strong> Risk</strong> here is falling comets which are of Different Chances of hitting as well as the different damage capacity ( knowledge of the Risk is very important as it helps in fighting them) and if they hit can cause damage as well as hinder Development(reduction in the development bar) .<br />here, being an Luminator we have <em><strong>to balance our resources in three powers</strong></em> given as<strong> <br />Research</strong>; to know the comets and damage capacity ( to know about the risk) , <br /><strong>Protection </strong>; to protect  from the waves by raising the island ( risk mitigation process) and third is <br /><strong>Insurance</strong> ; cheaper repairs of the pods if comet hits (The Cost Reduction in rebuilding of the society in case of damage).<br />                 <br />These powers if not used in time or improperly used then there can a shortage of funds for other requirements that follow..<br />eg. if We used all resources in Developing pods then we have no resources to protect them and neither for insurance .<br />    also if we used up all resources in Mitigating risk , protection or insurance then the development would be slowed and hindered.<br /><br />So as the game progresses the task of keeping up the process of Development with increased risks can be achieved by proper resource allocation and creating a balance between the three powers given to us used sustainably at proper time.<br />(This is exactly what needs to be done i.e proper prior planning and efficient implementation when fighting a Risk in real society.)<br /></div>
