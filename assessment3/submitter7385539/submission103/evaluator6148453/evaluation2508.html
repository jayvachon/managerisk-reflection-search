    <div class="field-value">The person I think understood how the game worked and thought about what to do if the game was played more. However, the actual English grammar used in this essay wasn't very good, which made it pretty hard to understand what the person was saying each sentence. Some of the words used didn't make sense, or didn't belong in the sentence. The idea behind the essay was there I think, but poor overall English grammar/structure to the essay. </div>
