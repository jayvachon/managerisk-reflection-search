    <div class="field-value"><b>Reflections from Risk Horizon<br /></b><b><br /></b>This game illustrates the relationship between development and risk management, and as development increases, so does the need to protect what has been built.  At the beginning of the game, I steadily built my community and kept insurance low, yet used knowledge on comets - in terms of time, severity, and the likelihood of a hit - in order to inform decisions on when to build and when to protect.  When a hit was "certain", I invested more in protection and upgrades to the pods to prevent damage; and if severity was high, I bought additional insurance.  I found that more insurance helped when I needed it.  It was much faster and easier to rebuild as those costs were low and I was able to afford it.<br /><br />I played the game several times with the intent of striving for balance between development and risk management, and found that it was difficult to get consistent results.  I observed that it was difficult to progress beyond level three if there was little development.  Nevertheless, I found that there was a lot of uncertainty in the game and could not figure out a distinct formula to win the game.<br /><br />The one thing I would change about the game would be to provide a synopsis of why I didn't progress to the next level once that happened.  I did not understand the specifics of what made me "lose".  Therefore, I would find it valuable if I were to learn from my mistakes in a more direct manner and apply those lessons in subsequent attempts of the game.  I think a similar synopsis that outlines best practices in balancing development and risk management would provide value and matter a great deal in the place where I live, where communities often build subdivisions in flood plains that are susceptible to damage if or when something goes wrong.<br />  <br /><br /><b></b></div>
