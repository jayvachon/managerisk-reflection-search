    <div class="field-value">This reflection is a rather clear feedback on of the disadvantages of the game. It is very honest and states the game's main weaknesses - not very clear connections with the course content and poor validity as a practising or testing tool. 
The best item of it, in my opinion, is the personal lesson learnt by the student, which is described clearly and  shows thorough reflection. Besides, this reflexion links the game to the course connent.

To make it better, I would suggest summarizing the main strategy in terms of risk management in a shorter and more concise way. 

As a personal comment, I would like to say that I don't think that the tools (clarity, comprehension and reflection) offered here for peer assessment are valid tools, because there was no definition of what exactly will be assessed when we were offered to write our game reflections. The task to reflect on the game did NOT state that we should operate terms or make links to the course content. Thus, assessing this now is unfair. Besides, the item clarity is supposed to assess the other person's command of the language, which is NOT a fair feature as this is not a language test.</div>
