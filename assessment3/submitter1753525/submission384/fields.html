    <h1>Submission 384 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1753525, session_user_id: 1f70676e538728cc6038e4230843c649014c1a01)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I have spent over an hour playing the game; it really seemed to me an overly dramatic way of dealing with the concept of risk. Firstly, the game is kind of winning or losing absolutely, which in the real world is almost nonexistent. Although, I found an original way to raise awareness of the importance of risk management in order to promote development and prevent collapse.
My strategy of playing was to build homes as possible as I could. This has been a mistake as in the first games I did not take long to fail. Then, I took insurance in order to minimize the damage of comets and have chosen to build fewer houses and climbing level. This has been more successful and has allowed me to reach the goal of leveling up.
Regarding the improvement of the game, I would do less tragic as the destructive comets seem very catastrophic for a game that talks about risk management for development. I would put sources of fresh water which dry, bankrupt banks, forest are cut down, something more real than comets from space.
