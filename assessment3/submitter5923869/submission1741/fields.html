    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Horizon game is very interesting game, it is one of the most useful and effective ways to manage potential risks in our community. It's has a leading role in risk management field. The game highlighted the three significance concepts of risk management for sustainable development. which is research or knowledge of risk mapping, protection and insurance. I think these concepts are very important for any risk reduction and  contingency planning. From the gram and to be more practical, if we going to manage any potential risk in our communities, we should simply based our actions and planning on risk mapping, regarding to evidence-based knowledge or research. Without a appropriate data and deep knowledge related to the risk mapping we can not prepare effectively, In case we managed to prepare very well, this well leads to long-term prevention and protection from the any potential disasters that going to hit our communities. 

From this game I got many practical benefits. Firstly,  risk management is a high priority in our communities, particularity, in terms of long-term planning and keeping our resources functional.  whit risk management we can invest more and more in the limited resources we posses, as well as  have best practices and cost-effective system to keep these resources functioning in our community as long as possible. </div>
