    <h1>Submission 2206 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6691479, session_user_id: 627cb36bb619427e96850cbf47f9079fcb0c1c9e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div><b>What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?</b></div></div><div></div><br />The role of risk management is clearly visible as it makes you juggle the responsibility of developing your pods while managing limited resources and determining whether to protect or insure developed pods against destructive comets, successfully doing this will allow you to complete the level. Risk management makes us understand that in order to make informed decisions, knowledge about imminent risk in the game this danger was posed by comets of varying levels of destruction whose true potential risk can only be determined by research which doesn't take your monetary resources however it studying comets reduces the amount of time that your have to protect your pods.<i><br /></i><div><div><br /><b>If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?</b></div></div><div></div><br />I played the game more than once on the second time I spend less time protecting my pods and more time researching the comets as early as possible as I found out that the more research you do the easier it is to build community connections and these lead to less damage. I also learnt that throwing money on protection was less efficient in managing risk than buying insurance, so in subsequent games I spent less time on protecting the pods, more time on research  and more resources on insurance.<br /><br /><div><strong>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</strong></div><div><br /></div>Changes I would make would concern the process of protection and the monetizing of the research process, this will make it easier to compare decisions value in 'similar currency'.</div>
