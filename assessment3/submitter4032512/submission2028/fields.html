    <h1>Submission 2028 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4032512, session_user_id: 9e96ee528e08dcf1acdc38af8e3318d091364e90)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I played the game at least 5 times,
reaching level 5 on several occasions. Knowing the role of risk management was
easy, because it was clearly stated in the games instructions, which was to:
find balance between risk preparation and healthy development. Each time I
played I found different ways to get this done, ending up with 3 keep words and
one sentence, that kept reminding me what I needed to do in order to win.</p>

<p><span>On my first game I wrote “(not) panic”, Because
in that game I ended up buying the most expensive insurances in each level, and
in the end lost because of lack of wealth. To stop being so paranoid I relied
on the knowledge I had about meteorites, which weren´t so bad in the first
levels.This way I kept from buying the 70% coverage insurance until level 5,
and used the protection options (that were cheaper) instead. </span></p>

<p><span>The second key word I wrote was “savings”.
This after playing 2 times, I realized that if I had saved some money, it would
have been easier to buy insurance or to archive the level’s goal faster in the
next level. So in this case, I can say that when it came to preparing for risk
it took some time to affect the development, because I had to postpone the growth
of my city so I could save money.</span></p>

<p><span>“Prepare” was my third key word. I wrote
this not because of the money, but because of the time factor. When a meteorite
hit and you had to click on the yellow lights, if you took too long, the damage
was worse; so when I knew I was going to be hit, I prepared myself and acted as
quick as possible. </span></p>

<p><span>And the last thing I notices was that it
was “easier to take risks when insured”. I wanted to take advantage of the fact
that I was being insured, so sometimes instead of saving the money I preferred
to build more houses so the next level goal could be reached. </span></p>

<p><span>When it comes to Mexico, I think that it
would help to have an option to strengthen the building without getting any
wealth out of it, just for risk preparation. Because even when it comes to
insurance we are still taking about money, and in Mexico we tend to think only
of money and not a lot of risk, and in this way the game could have a more literal
way of putting things in perspective. </span></p></div>
