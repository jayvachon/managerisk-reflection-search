    <h1>Submission 1276 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3265264, session_user_id: df533df8db781cdd19e9c8f1cb848e059a95dff9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>The Role of Risk
Management in the game was to protect the alora from the various obstacles in
the development of community. By the means of insurance, protection and
research the level of the severity from the risk in the alora can be protected.In terms of
knowledge, protection and insurance, the decision to confront with the falling
comets based on the available research to upgrade the knowledge significantly
helped in protecting the community form the shock waves. Based on the severity
and likely hitting from the comet, the de cison was taken to increase the level
of protection for the community form the shock waves. Based on the insurance
scheme the decision was taken based on the severity with the insurance scheme .
Though the development work has been stagnant to some extent during the
preparation for the protection of the community but the overall output was
positive as the community was resilient to the risk and was able to cope with
the shock afterwards.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I were to play
it again, I would get focused on three interlinked component of Knowledge,
Protection and insurance that would ultimately leads to the increased coping
capacity of the community. Through the game, I understood the effective risk
management aspects that had convinced me to prepare for uncertainty in an advance
which later helps to cope afterwards form the risk.</p>

<p> </p><p>The game has
incorporated all aspects of Natural disaster with its ultimate impact on the
development work. In context of Nepal, a developing country, with least prepared
quintile, I would like to include the aspects of the humanity and biodiversity
losses in the game so that the player can feel the game with an emotional
attachment. As the game is concerned with the physical damage, I would like to
include the level of human casualties as well as the losses of the biodiversity
from the risk.</p></div>
