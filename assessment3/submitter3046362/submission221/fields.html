    <h1>Submission 221 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3046362, session_user_id: 5509f89fae783a8e1cc159943f82f15af5abbf57)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game is based in some decisions we need to take in several ways:<br />1 – The probability of an accident;<br />2 – The insurance we take;<br />3 – The protection we have.<br />For all these issues we need to combine the development with the prevention and preparation for the disasters. We need to have money to combine these two crucial issues. The 3 factors (prevention, preparation and money) are the major keys to success in the development.<br />I played the game 3 times and all the times I had different strategies.  I learned what I referred above. We need money to develop but also we need a good prevention to prevent damages like insurance with 75% of protection and watch the probability of disaster. In the last game I played I developed faster and the goals went rapidly in the target.<br />After played the game the improvement I suggest is to make some input like temperature or flood because can be other variable to make more complex the game in the last level.</div>
