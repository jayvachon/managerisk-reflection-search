    <div class="field-value">The key strength is the understanding of significance of risk management is very well mentioned, which shows the learning to be strong.
Had the student mentioned the way various options of risk management were implemented in a more comprehensive way,that would have given a better reflection.Overall it's a good reflection.</div>
