    <h1>Submission 1830 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2541112, session_user_id: ca779406a2d2de7afc5c1f169a295dc8f0d2f0c9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">As a risk manager in this beautiful fantasy world I managed to get through the severe rain of meteorites! Citizens are safe and no dammage has occured. <br /><br />As the possibility to obtain reliable knowledge about the exact severity of the meteorites was limited, i have trusted mainly on creating protection. All the time I increased the protection to the second-highest protection level - not the highest as the cost benefit analysis indicated that such events are very unlikely. As my first line of defence was so well I was able to refrain from investing in insurance investments. In order to obtain sufficient funds I have both build new houses and upgraded existing once as soon as possible. <br /><br />If I would play the game again I would allow a somewhat lower level of direct protection. This would create additional funds that I could invest in (productive) housing. Potentially I would buy insurance too, even though it was hard to estimate the necessity of this.<br /><br />To provide better risk management in my daily (financial service industry) life it seems especially necessary to overcome the behavioral shortcoming: people tend to be overconfident and have short memory: as it turns out all the time: this time is NOT different....<br /></div>
