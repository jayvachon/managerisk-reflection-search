    <div class="field-value">This essay barely explains the game in any sense. First, the student describes flying a virtual aircraft which has absolutely nothing to do with the game. He describes engineering faults which is out of context.

For the next three quarters of the essay, he tries to use football and the preparation Brazil has to go through to host the 2014 World Cup as a metaphor for the game. "Passing the ball to your team mate" and "requirements to cope with the tourist inflow" is largely out of context and does not answer the 3 questions required for this assignment. </div>
