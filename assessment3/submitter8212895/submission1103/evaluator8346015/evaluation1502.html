    <div class="field-value">Real life examples in this essay is a huge strong point as well as direct references made to the course material. This person has made a real effort to understand and has more than grasped the concept of what the main components are of risk management and how it relates in terms of real world situations.

The beginning was very difficult to understand and get into the flow of the essay , this could have been better. Also there are some minor typos and some lines that need to be rephrased or punctuation changed so that it can be better understood. </div>
