    <h1>Submission 1668 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4241359, session_user_id: b9d7d1dd2f13bed7c6615cb7773e780311337db3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main role of risk management in the game
was to take action in the three different ways of tackling risk; research,
protection and insurance at the same time that you had to focus in developing
your “town”. The choices that I have made were mainly research the different asteroids
while I was saving money for developing the houses for gaining higher returns
and reinvest the profits in insurance, protection and in keeping developing the
houses. Thanks to that, most of the time I had plenty of time; after the
asteroid hit the rock, for improve connections among town in order to reduce
the damage produced by the hit. The preparation for this hitting allowed me to
not have to spend money in fixing damages and keep growing. Due to I could
reach level four very easily. All this prevention and protection policy that I followed
was translated in growing not immediately but I would say that almost.</p>

<p>I have played more than once and what I did
differently was try to develop the houses at the same time I was spending
resources in research or in protection, as I said before, that allowed me to
gain higher returns and reinvest the pay offs in more protection and progress. Before
I was all the time trying to increase the protection and I did not pay that
much attention to research, I thought that only with protection and insurance
would have been enough. What I have learned is that you cannot be focused just
in one task like developing or improving the protection, you have to find a
balance within developing, protection, research and insurance. As long you can
find that balance your “town” will grow up and better protected and therefore a
better and safer place to live.</p>

<p><span>I am not sure but maybe I would add some different
ways of improving the town, not just developing the houses, something like
investing in water, energy, healthcare or education in order to see how
investing in these areas can improve in many different manners.  As a consequence you could see how different
areas develop a city or a country.</span></p></div>
