    <div class="field-value">Very well thought out. I agree that implementation of disaster management would be a great functionality to add to the game as it is a major part of recovery from national disasters such as typhoons. In terms of improvement, the author`s writing style indicates that he or she may be English second language due to issues with tense (ie spend vs spent, focus vs focused) and I found that the vocabulary choices used in conjunction with these tense issues made the reading slightly difficult to understand. As a native speaker, I would recommend using simpler words to communicate ideas so all English speakers can fully appreciate your detailed reflection</div>
