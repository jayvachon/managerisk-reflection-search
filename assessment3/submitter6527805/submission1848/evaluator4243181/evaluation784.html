    <div class="field-value">I think that the key strength of this reflection is when he/she said the  following: "As a recent graduate from international development studies, I have not until commencing this course fully realised the significance of risk management within this field, and, it was given a substantially small amount of attention during my course" and added:  "I will suggest for my university to implement this game into the course plans of one or several of the modules." 

Excellent reflection !</div>
