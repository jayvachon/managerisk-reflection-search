    <div class="field-value">There are very sound and interesting suggestions the student has articulated in how to further improve the game. There is basic understanding of the principles and components of risk management. It is clear that the student applied this understanding through different levels of the game, in which lessons learned from the first level were taken into account in the next level. 

Beyond this, the allocation of resources to strike a balance between risk mitigation measures and development should have been more clearly articulated as this is a fundamental consideration when choosing and adopting the best risk management strategy.</div>
