    <h1>Submission 631 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4778982, session_user_id: 123b2c26e599f9232db89bfb794a93bc850a99bd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>To start, a very well put together simulation. During the
game, it is clear to see that the choices that are made effects the outcome of
the realized risks. The feeling of over protecting on an area of risk that was
not realized was disheartening; however, I guess that’s the real life point. If
you purchase too much on mitigation and only get modest hits; or spend too much
on insurance and protection such that insurance never kicks in. So, the role of
risk management revolves around making the balanced choices to excel in development
while staying moderately protected. Not to totally avoid the impact of realized
risk, but to moderate it. If too much is spent on mitigation the development suffers.
Even when you achieve zero damage, the big picture is failure.</p>

<p>I did play the game a number of times, effecting different
mitigation strategies and not surprising, I found that there is no magic bullet
of over-investing in any single mitigation that would solve all negative
impact. You must find a balance between the different strategies. You need to
balance your spending efforts on development and soften the blow of realized
risks in order for the greater good to succeed. The only outstanding
observation that I made is that the research option, which allowed for
communication upon realized impact, appeared to be one item that reduced the
impact of realized risks the most over the others on a consistent basis –
during my games. When focused on building community, devastation occurred. When
focused on over-protection, development suffered. When focused on insurance
alone, there was still enough damage to impact disaster, etc.</p>

<p>In my experience playing the game, more than once in fact,
with focus on different risk strategies, I found that it was rather realistic
in that it was difficult to assess the success of one risk strategy over
another. There is no clear winner. Further, the results and review (i.e.
lessons learned) did not explain the specific level of effect or success that one
strategy provided over another. Of course, if we do not get the answer in real
life either. Once we review the outcome of a disastrous event, we analyze the
what-if’s, then make our plans. Upon a subsequent event, we can evaluate the
results of our previous theories to some extent; however, it is still too
difficult to determine the results had we made different decisions beforehand.
A little like real life as well. I would say; however, that in a game such as
this, the randomization likely makes the model outcomes harsher than we would
find in real life. That said, it still brings us closer to understanding these
events, theories and strategies much better than without such models.</p>
