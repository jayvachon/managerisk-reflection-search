    <div class="field-value">I'd give maximum for the effort apart from that this was more or less like a description of how the game played was more or less a review of a kind. Anyhow, the strength of this particular assignment was that the person was willing to learn and that deserves accolades.

I would like to see examples which are directly or indirectly related to the game as in how a certain scenario is related to the real life events, and how certain problems are resolved..</div>
