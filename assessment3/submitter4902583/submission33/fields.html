    <h1>Submission 33 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4902583, session_user_id: a2ddc36bf255fdbd0a02259026fc8059ece284c2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I consider this game as being very educative and useful to learn how to manage risks and cope with the effects of a bad event.<br />I played this game more than once and I reached a higher level each time (after I have submitted the code I played again and I reached level 6).<br />First of all, I started the game building as many pods as I could (5). In the first game I tried to make high insurances but I learned from that game that it wasn't really necessary. In the second game I tried to increase the protection and that was a good strategy because insurances were less important (damages weren't very high and many of the hits could be avoided by connecting pods). That was true until level 4; after reaching level 4, the number of hits increased and the protection decreased quickly. I managed to reach level 5 but my protection became very low and now any hit suffered without protection was destructive.<br />Anyway, another disadvantage of using the protection as a strategy is that while you are increasing the shield the total upgrade level stops its increasing pattern (remains constant), so you might lose precious time for developing the pods.<br />Regarding the research of the comets, it is useful to know better what will you be hit by but it isn't recommended to wait to much to get a better prediction. After a quick research you could try to move your attention to the things you can improve and to the countermeasures you can take to prevent a hit. I find that more useful than wasting time for learning more accurate things about every comet.<br />The very bad thing about the insurance strategy is that after finishing a level all the insurances are lost and you need to buy a new one, wasting lots of money.<br />If I could develop a new game similar with this one and I would need to add only one thing I would try to change the balance between the insurances and protection at the start of the game. The player should spend more time choosing the strategy at the start of the game and insurances should be more important.<br />The game is based on risk management and this can be seen in each choice that the player makes. The player needs to find the equilibrium in this game.</div>
