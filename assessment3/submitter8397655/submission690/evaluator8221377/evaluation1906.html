    <div class="field-value">In this essay you showed a rather good theoretical understanding of the subject, as presented in the lectures. However, it is good to realise that all gained theoretical knowledge is only useful when correctly applied.
The game is designed to help you to use the knowledge you described in a simulated practical setting. Thanks to that, then, you can practice balancing all aspects of risk management with development. As you encounter many obstacles along the way, the game allows you to reflect and try different strategies to overcome them. It is particularly this repeated obstacle-reflection-strategy triangle that helps you to learn by playing.
Taking all this into account and looking at the questions that were given as a guideline for writing the short assignment, the main shortcoming of your essay is that it is missing the 'reflection' part that is the goal result of learning, application, and insight.
Whatever your motivation for studying this course, do not despair - take your hard-earned factual knowledge and learn to apply it, reflect on the struggles, learn from them, and have another go. Then you can be sure you start to stand out of the crowd that struggles with making things happen :-)</div>
