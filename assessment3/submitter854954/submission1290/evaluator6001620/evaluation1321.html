    <div class="field-value">A good overview of the main points from the course so far and a good understanding of the goals and strategies of the game.  It is clear that the author has spent time reading the course materials and fully understands all of the aspects covered so far.

To improve, I might have spent less time on summarizing the topics covered already and perhaps a bit more on the experience learned from the game.  Also, there were no changes suggested for how to improve the game.</div>
