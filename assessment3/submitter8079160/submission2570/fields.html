    <h1>Submission 2570 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8079160, session_user_id: 079ec237881db8e943a6c9ba446d6a06999c9bc1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Risk Horizon game is the great tool for training people's knowledge in terms of risk management. Personally, I've reached the 4th level out of 3 attempts and I'd like to describe my game strategy. At the very beginning we have limited resources and completely undeveloped planet, thus we have to protect this planet from the external shocks (here asteroids, with different severity, chance of hit and damage). However, we can purchase a protection from different level for different price (the highest level for highest price).<br />At the very start of each round I would strongly recommend other players to buy maximum insurance and try to build as much infrastructure, as it possible. Through the whole game the upgrade of an infrastructure generates higher outcome that it costs. I would also recommend to provide the internal protection, such as higher level of the group (that will get lower, when the asteroid hits). You should never forget providing researches (clicking on the asteroids), the minimum costs provide huge protection from crisis.<br />In terms of risk management this game shows us, how necessary are obtaining knowledge, insurance and protection stages and how people can benefit from developing infrastructure and providing risk management operations.<br />According to my personal experience, I would upgrade this game with more compatibility to economical and market shocks, on the higher levels for example. After building an infrastructure with society, game could be upgrade to the full model of planet Earth today, with several and significant economic crises, stack of internal shocks, such as floods and earthquakes, wars etc.</div>
