    <h1>Submission 504 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3747596, session_user_id: 4719f733053947d005fbf0b2e4ec5fcdd04287a2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I started playing the game the same way I act in my life,
working on something when something comes up. But after failing at level 1, I
decided to change my strategy. </p><p>I began investing in building three pods at
first and then obtained the highest insurance and protected my colony around
level 4. Once I got enough money back, I decided to invest it upgrading two
pods and building a new one. While I waited for the constructions to finish up, I
researched the most dangerous comets. Using this tactic, I reached level 4, but
got an error message when I loose and had to restart all over again.</p>

<p>This time, I was more experience and so I followed a
different strategy, less conservative and more aggressive. Instead of
purchasing the level 3 insurance, I purchased the level 2. Also started
building 4 pods from the begging regaining my investment faster and reinvesting
it in pods upgrades and protection. With this strategy, I obtained the highest
mark on level 1, so I was able to build all the pods on level 2 and have them
upgraded (some of them three times) at the end of level 2. Every time a
high-risk comet appeared on the sky I spent some money on protection to pair it
to the comet level and when it impacted, the damages were null.  I entered level 3 in a very good shape,
upgrading my pods and following the same strategies as above, but two strong
comets impacted near the end of the level and although I was ready, there was
such a short period of recovery time between impacts, they hurt my development
level badly. And so I entered level 4 and 5 were I perished, almost borderline,
but failed after a strong comet impact destroyed 39% of my colony.</p>

<p>If I had to add something to the game, I would add the human
factor. This is an entertaining game, but I didn’t start taking it seriously until
I realize that inside those pods were some creatures living. If the game takes
an account like the number of “people” being protected when you build a new
pod, or how their chance of survival increases if you upgrade a pod or study a
comet, the game would be more interesting and realistic at the same time.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the experience and in the mean time, I
learnt that if you start with a good development and have a nice insurance, you
can focus on protection and research acting faster and when the risk becomes a
reality and getting over it sooner.</p></div>
