    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management in the game was very clear once I had to ponder between all available tools to achieve the goal, so it was necessary know which was the best tool for each situation, how much time or money spent researching, protecting or buying insurance, etc. Also, the preparation for risk was strictly connected to development because when the negative outcome was realized, the magnitude of loss - in terms of resources and time to recover - was given by your condition, what in turn was related with the actions you had done to prepare.</div><div>I played the game about three times, and my biggest mistake in the first and second attempt was neglect the importance of research for preparation to the risk. Considering this, the main thing I learned was the importance of a good research in order to acquire knowledge and preparing for the risk.</div><div>A simple thing I would suggest to add to improve the game is some way to represent the systemic character of some disasters when they happen and the prompt action isn't done.</div></div>
