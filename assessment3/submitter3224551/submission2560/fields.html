    <h1>Submission 2560 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3224551, session_user_id: 484782bdf98f5d02a99d7ed94450bc83d0516282)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At first the game looked like like any
other game with the ususal choices and 'lifes'. But with the benefit
of the lectures, it was easier to appreciate the puzzles from the
perspective of risk managemnt. The role of risk management was
quickly evident in the game early on as I had at my first try
attempted to absorb the risk of guess-timating wich of the comets was
likely to be more catastrophic from its physical character like
speed. The effects were like playing Russian roulette; I lost
woefully. Thus my non-preparation jeopardized my community. 
</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The role of research/knowledge in
everyday life was really highlighted as when I traded real knowledge
for gut-feeling, I almost always lost. Also my personal reliance in
everyday life of protection was challenged as a cure all, especially
when it had the effect of retarding development in the game. Thus
opportunities for better growth/development were avoideded instead of
taking necessary risk. Insurance seemed to play a greater role in
allowing me do better than is my real life appreciation of the tool,
previously I only saw insurance as a defencive tool, but the game
made me realize it could also effectively be used as an 'offensive'
tool..</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I varied the amount of protection and
insurance I used while always using the benefit of research/knowledge
and this got me to the highest level I got, though I suspect I was
still playing much too safe with too much protection rather than
insurance. The effects of this game is to allow me see the reality of the real world application of risk management. Occasionally i was stunned as the game seemed to reflect a political life cycle for most democracies where keeping the community safe is not good enough but also concerted community growth and in a timely manner, equivalent to the four year terms of a lot of democratically elected governments.Â  I will give the game another go!!</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If a tweak for adapting the game to my
local reality were to be added, it would have to be literacy-education
as a catalyst to the use of research/knowledge. There is quite a bit
of research/knowledge in the environs but there is a real disconnect
between that information and the belief in the generality of the
populace as to the efficacy of that knowledge. So thus in this game
the research would only be as effective as the 'educated' members of
the community who consult together to mitigate the effects of the
comets' waves.</p><p><br /></p>
