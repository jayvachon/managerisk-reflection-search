    <div class="field-value">I think the strength of the reflection lies in the focus of insurance. Though I feel, that the high initial insurance was way too high as people do not have a high reserve amount to cater for high levels of insurance. 
Also, the reflection could have been written better had the individual shared his vast experience (through repeated attempts) that would have laid focus on the fact that preparation to mitigate a risk is most important as we do not have a trial and error model available in every day scenarios.</div>
