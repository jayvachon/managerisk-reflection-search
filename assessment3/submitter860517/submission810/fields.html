    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The first role of an effective risk management is to create/build the community and prepare for the protection against any potential threat, this has to do with with the systematic way of researching the potential risk either systemic or idiosyncratic. In terms of making choices, after the creation of the community, the next step was to buy an insurance policy although, the system was programmed in a way that one has to buy insurance at every level/stage. After buying the insurance it is also necessary to invest on security and simultaneously make researches to have knowledge of the incoming threat ,to know the level of severity of the disaster on the community, and also to know the possibility of the crises. In doing this, it is sometimes good to trade-off Insurance for knowledge and protection but it is of opinion that more concentration should be on the knowledge as to know the level of severity. Meanwhile the preparation of risk management affect development of the community through a collective effort of the people in the community immediately and after the disaster. The community involvement is one factor that a society could leverage on for development after a disaster had occurred in order for people to be able to cope immediately and after a disaster.<br /><br />2. At first, when i played the game it was like the most difficult thing i have ever seen thinking that I may not be able to go above the first level, this is just because i did not get my priorities right, for instance, instead of making research and be watchful of how the disaster moves, i was busy developing the community, although, developing community makes me to have green lives the more development the higher the green level. What i now did differently from the first game was to carefully develop the community make research, buy insurance and simultaneously increase the security bar but not to exhaust the money meant for development on security. Basically, I have learned a lot through this game, I have come to understand that, for effective risk management, having developed a community to a certain state, it is important to have a good understanding of a potential risk and prepare for it. This preparation starts from gathering the knowledge required to understand the nature of the disaster, invest in insurance policy and security simultaneously. Also, in order to be able to cope after the disaster, there should be a joint effort by the individual, community, state/government and perhaps the international institution to provide mechanism for coping immediately after the disaster and even after.<br /><br />3. Understanding the fact that there are some risks that can not be control which are commonly systemic, But the game should have a platform for idiosyncratic risk as well, may be the game will have to be in two versions. This is not to say this version of the game is not perfectly programmed, trust me its cool and fantastic plus its brain tasking. For instance in the place i live, we are just lucky for now that we barely witness systemic risk rather its more of idiosyncratic risk. This is not to say that the place is free of the systemic risk. <br /></div>
