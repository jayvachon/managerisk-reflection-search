    <div class="field-value">This risk management game was a very intelligent and strategic game, we had to make insurance so we could get paid, acordingly from what we paid for the ensurance, when the meteor hit our planet. Risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events or to maximize the realization of opportunities. Risks can come from uncertainty in financial markets, threats from project failures, legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents</div>
