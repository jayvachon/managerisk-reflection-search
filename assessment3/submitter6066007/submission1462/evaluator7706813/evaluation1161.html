    <div class="field-value">From my point of view, i think you actually made a pretty good reflection, you answered every question and you really explained your ideas even i have to admit some of them were confusing because you didn't use "verbs" in past tense. Beyond that you simply should connect your ideas in a better way, your are doing a responsible job working in the course so im grateful to see other people takes this seriously.</div>
