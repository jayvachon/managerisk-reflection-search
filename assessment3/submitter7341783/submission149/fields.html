    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.  The role of risk management in the game  is to develop our community to the best of my ability while meeting certain milestones along the way.The point of the game is to think about how to balance investing in economic development (by building and upgrading pods) and preparing for risk (by obtaining insurance, protection and knowledge about the comets).As the  money in hands and the time of game is limited,i spent most of money in developing economic,but ensured that there was enough money for insurance and protection and  potential loss.Also,i did research while developing the economic so as to gain more knowledge about the potential risks--the shocks of the comets.From my perspectives,preparation for risk affect development after some time.</p><p>2.I have played the game several times,i think it is quite difficult because there are many factors need to be considered. The best results I got is level 3,but most of the time, I was in level 1.I tried several times at first to tried to understand the rules of the game and how to operate correctly.And after going through several tries and failure,i gradually figured out that  to pass each level you need to get this balance right - if you spend too much on development, you will not be sufficiently prepared and suffer big losses when shocks hit; if you spend too much on preparation (or save your money for repairs) you will not generate enough growth to pass each level.Therefore,the most i learn from the game is  that no matter what situation i am in ,game or reality,i should always take many crucial related factors into account and balancing them when i am making decisions to avoid or lessen risks and potential loss while maximizing opportunities.</p><p>3.The place i live is a small town,whose economic is fall behind.As being a poor area,it faces the opportunity to become industrialize to boost its economic,but at the same time ,it has to face the risks of its environment being polluted as so many factories move to this area.  Therefore if i were tasked with <span>developing a new version of the game,i will change the falling probability of comet from being fall randomly to being fall depend on the number of pods.That is mean as the number of pods growing up(which means a higher degree of industrialization of the town),the  falling probability and the number as well as the degree of damage of the comets are becoming higher(which stands for the environment pollution),and others all keep the same.By the new game ,we could </span>better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i live.</p><p><br /></p></div>
