    <h1>Submission 1854 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8015934, session_user_id: 00b50ae1ba88e96524f59ba5c79c951f530e549e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game was
shown in a simplified manner yet at the same time essential to progressing. You
could choose one option at a time leading to decisions needing to be made about
what was the most important factor; knowledge, protection or insurance. </p>

<p><span>In my own attempts I found that my tactics
changed slightly each time I restarted the game. I only managed to reach level
2 but I tried over a dozen times to progress further than that – something wasn’t
working! In order to progress from level 1 to level 2 it became apparent that I
needed to build more pods and expand development. At first I only built and
developed 2 or 3 pods but tried to increase levels of protection, this however
proved to be too costly in terms of the time I had available and consequently it
halted development.  </span></p>

<p><span>At the same time I was purchasing insurance
of the middle or top standard early on in the game in order to reduce the
impact that comets caused as well as trying to raise levels of protection
whenever I could, either as pods developed or after all comets had passed.  This was a tactic that I used throughout the
game but more importantly I found that when the opportunity for research arose I
had to take it in order for development to continue.  In review I see that levels of protection were
forgone for the sake of research and development.</span></p>

<p><span>In terms of moving on to level 3 I think I
would need to have higher levels of protection in order to reduce the impact of
disasters. My problem though was working out how to achieve this whilst
researching and developing. The speed and intensity at which comets came in
level 2 was probably the most difficult aspect of the game for me.  </span></p>

<p><span>Although simplified, I think the game successfully
communicated the idea that all decisions have impacts. It also doesn’t necessarily
matter if a decision is good in the short term because if it isn’t carried out in
the context of the bigger plan then it will not have long lasting and
successful effects.  This is why the
preparation stages for risk didn’t automatically have an effect on levels of
development but instead paved the way for reducing the impacts of disasters in
the future. </span></p>

<p><span>If I was to develop a new version of the
game I would try to embed different patterns for the comets to strike each time
the game restarted. This is because I found that after numerous attempts I was
able to predict which comets were alright to leave alone and which needed the
most preparation. For obvious reasons this is not what happens in real life
when dealing with disasters. 
Alternatively I would add an “advice” function which would supply some
hints as to how to develop further. This I think would significantly alter how
people play the game and better reflect my situation of living in a developed
country with access to help from other nations and the ability to study and
copy the successful strategies of other countries.   </span></p>

<p><span>I have found the Risk Horizon game to be an
effective tool in demonstrating how a balance needs to be found between
different components in managing risk for development so to have a successful
result.  </span></p></div>
