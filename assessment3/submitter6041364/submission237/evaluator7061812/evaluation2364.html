    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is that the author demonstrated real understanding of both the risk management concepts and concepts learned from the game being applied to the real world. The bullet-pointed sections highlight key areas of understanding and learning.

This reflection was very difficult to understand. In truth, I should have awarded 0 points on "clarity" because that accurately describes my experience in reading it. However, I understand that this class is mostly composed of students for whom English is not their native language, so I felt it unfair to fully penalize the author.</div>
