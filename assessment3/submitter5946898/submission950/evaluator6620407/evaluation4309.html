    <div class="field-value">"The game taught me that knowledge is key" is literally  the key strength of this refletion. Knowledge is one of the basis for risk management. If you play the game more and not only levels one and two, you will see that sometimes you don't have enough time to do research and protection, and that is what occours in real life when you face some kinds of risks, that's why knowledge is important. 

This reflection could be better if the "HOW PREPARATION FOR RISK AFFECTED DEVELOPMENT' section was improved. There are lots of things that can be said about this topic. When apply protection is better than research? When research is better than protection? Which insurance is good?</div>
