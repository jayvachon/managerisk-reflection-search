Dear colleague, it is nice to read your interesting and insightful game reflection. I am really privileged to read and evaluate your work. Then, in providing feedbacks based on my observation;
1.	Strengths:
•	Your reflection is clear to understand
•	It is very good that started with linking horizon with the message intended to be conveyed in the game or risk management 
•	Regarding question number 1, it is good to relate with the learning material in this course
•	Regarding question number 2, your several tries and achieving level 4 is indicative that you have learned a lot about what changes or alternatives to be made for successful risk management
•	Regarding question number 3, you proposed very interesting changes – that is involving multiple players. I think this would be very innovative based on the concept of integrating multiple actors – a holistic approach- for successful risk management 
2.	Weaknesses:
•	I think you did not directly address the question of “In what ways did preparation for risk affect development” in question number 1
•	Regarding the questions of lessons learnt from the game under question number 2, it would have been better to show the lesson learnt, based on your tries, regarding the process of managing risk. 
In summary, I really appreciated your reflection that you have really understood the message that the game tries to convey.  That means you understand that what knowledge can be obtained from playing thisgame that can be applied in any other related context than in specific context like in the context of avoiding the risk of hitting comet in the game.
Thank you for submitting this interesting reflection and I wish you all the best
