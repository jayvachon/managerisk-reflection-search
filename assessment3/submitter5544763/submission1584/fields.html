    <h1>Submission 1584 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5544763, session_user_id: d0bf8ab718bf51eb70dfc00a9909801e42326724)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>

</p><p>The
role of risk management in this game is to balance my development with
protecting it against comets. While the scope and levels of pod constructions
has to be maximized within limited wealth and time, I have to minimize
the loss brought by the comets via prediction of severity and chance
of hit (knowledge), raising the bars to reduce damage (protection) and
purchase of insurance, which is to reduce the repairmen cost, and replenish
some of any development. </p><p>

</p><p>I
always purchased the level 1 and/or level 2 insurance at the very beginning of
each level, which reduced my capital for development. Also, after every
checking the severity of the comet, I spent plenty of time raising the bar to
align with the severity level, which halted the development and reduced capital
for other actions. The only aspect I did not do much for preparation for risk
is knowledge. I only clicked on every comet once or at most twice, because I
thought the prediction (knowledge of the risk) was not quite
important. Therefore, very often I spent a lot of time and
capital protecting the village against the comets that were missed. This
also reduced the allowed time for community connections after the hit. Damage
increased owing to this. </p><p>

</p><p>I
am quite satisfied with attaining level 4. However, if I had another chance, I
would buy a higher level of insurance, and spend more time on research, so as
to reduce the time and wealth used to raise the bars (protection). The higher
level insurance would help me to recover sooner within limited resources and
replenish the losses at a greater extent. With more research, I would not spend
any time that has very little chance to hit, but more building and upgrading
the pods. With limited wealth and time, the crux of the matter is to balance
the extent of knowledge, protection, and insurance for managing and coping with
the risk. </p><p>

</p><p><span>If
I could modify the game, I would add the symbol to represent the international
financial aid, for players to click on after the hit. Not only the financial
aid scale adjusts with the extent of damage, it shrinks in scale across
each level to demonstrate the realistic situation that international donation
will diminish with the increased frequency of natural disasters, as people
become more apathetic towards frequent tragedies. Not only this modification
helps simulate the realistic situation more thoroughly, it also inspires users
to re-contemplate the unsustainability brought by behavioural dependence on
international aid, as found in many developing countries. </span></p><p><br /></p></div>
