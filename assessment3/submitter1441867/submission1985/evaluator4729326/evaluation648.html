    <div class="field-value">the student is very straight forward in his views about the game. this is the only strength of this reflection.
the reflection would have been better if the student would have clearly specified as to what were the shortcomings of the game that made it so boring and bad for him. he could also point out some of the mistakes he made due to which he was not able to clear a single level.</div>
