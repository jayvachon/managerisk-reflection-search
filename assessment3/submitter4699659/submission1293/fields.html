    <h1>Submission 1293 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4699659, session_user_id: 42f93d1eafbb1bd76b53e46f8e624ddc6dd952a6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game for 2 times. In my first play, i planned to build as much as pods i could with the budget i have. But i could not have enough money for insurence and protection. So when the meteors came and hit, most of my pods were damaged. So when i want to fix my damaged pods, i need to pay more money and my budget was again not enough. Then in my second play, i decided to implement some risk management tools. I built less pods at the beginning and as i have more money i got insurence. then i made my protection better and i followed the meteors to increase my research level. By doing this i saw that meteors did not damage me so much. So i could save my budget better. Then i could build more pods and increase the level of my pods. By using these risk management tools, i could easily pass o second level. But in the second level, the insurance cost was too high that i could not buy. So the meteors damaged me too much. And i could not fix my pods easily. I tried to increase my protection and research levels but these were not enough to pass to third level. <br />The lesson i learned from the game is that prepairing to a risky event costs me less than fixing after the event. To increase my research level and protection level and make insurance before the event costs much less than fixing your damaged assets after the event. We have to plan our risk management activities in parallel to our investments. We have to take into account the risk management because it helps us have less damages and recover faster and easier.<br />The game could improve the research section more and the game could express the importance of the research more clearly. The game can include some other features like insurance that we can buy some specialists and increase our research quality with these specialists more. So we can decrease the effect of meteor hits. </div>
