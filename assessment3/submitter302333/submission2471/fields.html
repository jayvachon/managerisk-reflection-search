    <h1>Submission 2471 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 302333, session_user_id: f07397335860c3fe0d156910f62adc82b12d457e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game we already know the type of comet and their risk and protection properties. so we can secure our system as long as we have enough money. so we need to build more pods, but not too many otherwise we will not have enough money for protection. <br />If i play this game again, next time I'll keep in mind that as soon as we see a comet coming, we need to reach the level of protection equal to the level of severity. <br />If i play this game more than one time, first i will build some pods and then reach the maximum level of protection, then if i have some money, i will buy insurance. after all this i will focus on the upgradation of the pods.<br />If i have to develop a new version of this game, i will make some changes. my first change will be the display size of the game window. and second change will more graphic option. my third and major change will be use of both keyboard and mouse.<br /><br /><br /></div>
