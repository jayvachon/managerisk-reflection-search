    <h1>Submission 1923 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8362601, session_user_id: 3963e99b43d719ab35a1ff7c29a5610ead249728)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b><u>REFLECTION</u></b></p><p><span>The game basically
talks about how we the (individuals, nation. etc) should be able to prepare for
risk and at the same time investing in developmental projects. The role of risk
management in the game is to cope and prepare for the uncertainty whilst taking
advantage of opportunities through the building of developmental projects. Through
preparation (by investing or doing a research on the comets), one is able have
a knowledge to face any shock these comet may pose.  </span></p><p><b>Ways
in which Preparation of risk affect our development</b></p><p>Knowledge, protection
and insurance constitute preparation. Preparing for risk either through
research or knowledge helps to minimise the level of shock that will occur. Having
an informed knowledge and taking practical steps about certain uncertainty may eliminate
some of the obstacles we might face in our developmental goals. </p><p>Depending on the amount
of wealth at hand, sometimes is very important not to invest in insurance at
the initial stages. The type of insurance to buy is basically dependent on the
knowledge of the risk one has. Insurance companies can sell a product which
will not be beneficial if you don’t have any knowledge of the risk at hand.</p><p>As the saying goes, ‘prevention
is better than cure’- is very prominent to protect ourselves rather than
thinking of having a cure for it. In certain instances, the cost to prevent an
impending danger is relatively less than the cost in repairing it. For example,
in Ghana where the rate of mosquito related diseases is higher, is advisable for
the populace to protect themselves using mosquito nets or using insecticide</p><p><b>2</b></p><p><span>When I played the game once,
I was focusing all my attention and resources on building and upgrading the
pods to the detriment of investing in developing the community. For instance I
paid more attention on buying insurance and I was not able to progress pass
level 1. I then realised that to strategically balance preparing for risk and
investing in developing the community, I should equally gain knowledge (research)
and  have a form of protection. </span></p><p>I have learnt a lot of
lessons from playing the game. Playing the game has enlightened be to be very
obejective. I need to get myself prepared and take on some risk or sometimes I
need to act when a shock has occurred. I also learnt that increased information
via research helped me to understand the nature and the likelihood of risk i.e.
reducing the uncertainty. Through the knowledge gained, I was able to protect
myself from any eventualities with the aim to mitigate losses and increase any
probability and positive outcome. During the game, one remarkable thing that I
learnt was that Protection and having knowledge in itself is not sufficient to
eliminate or minimise risk. Sometimes, one has to go the extra mile of
obtaining insurance to help cushion the blow of any shock in an adverse
situation.</p><p><b>3.
</b><span>Crises
repeatedly happen because people fail to implement the needed improvement in
risk management (World Bank Report, 2014). In my current city Coventry (UK),
when snow falls during winter time, is extremely dangerous to drive or walk
around. In my candid opinion there should be stringent laws to help save lives
during those seasons. For instance there is a law in Germany which oversee to
it that individuals are to clear all snow (ice) in front of their houses,
drivers to put on winter tyres. The loss of live that occurs during such period
can be reduced if such laws are adhered strictly as in Germany.  <b></b></span></p><p> </p><p> </p><p>
