    <h1>Submission 1993 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 929107, session_user_id: bd9fd6735782c47c91dfb84bf69880f89e214a8c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game Risk Horizon simulates a
real-world task of building a community from scratch, with the
scenario/background built in outer space. </p>

<p>At the first attempt, the game seems pretty
easy: you build houses (or space stations?) and upgrade them based on the
budget you have. They more you build and upgrade, the more likely for you to
keep up with the schedule and fulfill the requirement of keeping the meters
green. It is almost like a Monopolies game based on the outer space. </p>

<p>Yet that’s not all of it. The most
differentiate factors of the game is the risk of being hit by the asteroids. Not
every asteroids are gonna necessarily hit the planet, yet those who hit will
bring a massive shock wave and destruction to the community we built. To avoid
such destruction, we must accomplish two tasks alongside with building the
community: observing the asteroids to buy time for making connection, and lifting
the overall height of the community to minimize the damage. </p>

<p>Such involvement of the risk factor expanded
the decision matrix of the players: we are constantly facing trade-off as we
can’t do all these tasks at one time. Although we are tempted to spend all the
time and capital at building and upgrading the building, the threat of asteroids
damaging our works forces us to keep an eye on those red shooting stars in the
sky.After the first few unsuccessful attempts, we start to pay more respect to the asteroids and spend more time on observing them (or paying attention to insurance), which pays off by offering us more time to make connection and minimize the damages. </p>

<p>Such dilemma is very much the same with the
real-life decision making process: we are tempted to spend all our time and
energy on expending our assets, and prefer to believe that we won’t be so
unlucky to have the “asteroids” hit our houses. However, risk was and always
will be a major factor of our lives and ignoring it will only escalated the possible
damages. This game shows us (or even trains us?) to pay attention to the risk
factor in overall strategy planning, which is essential to the overall success
of a family, a community or even a country. </p><p>In the end, if I were to develop a new version of the game, I would expand the gap of the destruction between a small asteroid hit and a major hit. Or even introducing a systematic risk factor called "supernova explosion" or "aliens attack". For in real life, the risk we face have a wide expansion of destruction level. We might face small and avoidable risk like catching a minor disease, or a major and systematic ones like warfare and natural disaster. The systematic risk cannot be avoid through individual efforts and all must take the hit. It would be more realistic to include such unavoidable factors into the game to simulate real life scenarios. </p><p><br /></p></div>
