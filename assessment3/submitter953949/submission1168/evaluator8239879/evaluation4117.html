    <div class="field-value">What had been learnt and the understanding of the importance of risk management was conveyed very well in this reflection. I felt the person had really understood why we all need to consider risk management and the role it will play in the future.

Although many examples of other World issues were mentioned, I would have liked to have seen a specific example or two of how the specific game could have been improved. After all, the game itself will help to educate people of the importance of risk management, so it would be good if it was more accurate to the real World.</div>
