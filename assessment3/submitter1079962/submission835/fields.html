    <h1>Submission 835 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1079962, session_user_id: dff4fef7d103a7efdb18599be32f5089169ae9de)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.   
Role of Risk Management <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">are</span> as follows:</p>

<p><b>Knowledge</b> of comets about the severity &amp;
impacts of the comets &amp; doing research option and dissemination of early
warning to avoid the damage. </p>

<p><b>Protection</b> of community through raising
the platform and upgrading of the pods</p>

<p><b>Insurance</b> through transferring the risk
of pods for community from getting damaged by the hitting comets directly or by
indirectly by flooding/ tidal surge. </p>

<p>I tried to
<span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">develop</span> the pods as per the budget and gets immediate insurance for protection
in case of disaster. <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Also I</span> tried to keep watching the comet/s pattern of movements in terms of
their severity or doing research since the prediction may vary with the actual
landfall and severity of catastrophe followed with strong coordination and
dissemination of <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">Early Warning message</span> after the impact of comets in the sea. </p>

<p>Risk affects
development – there is always expenditure of funds if hazard or disaster occurs. When
it is a disaster followed by large economic loss and followed by reconstruction and recovery. In case of hazards or without loss small amount is
used for studying the movements of comets by doing research and expert driven
analysis.</p>

<p>2.   
I always prefer developmental activities like raising
of island, construction of <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">pods</span>, up gradation of pods, insuring under different schemes of pods during normal times or
else when the severity or risk of these comets is zero. But when there is
potential risk of damage I stop all the developmental activities and started
preparing the community by observing the <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">movements</span>/ coordination between different communities/ pods </p>

<p>3.   
I would propose strong technical up gradation in
<span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">construction</span> of pods/ building with standards, Land insurance, Group insurance,
<span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">strong early warning system</span> with 100 % coverage and reach with <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">affective early warning forum</span></span> with
<span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">participation</span> of every line departments and potential stakeholders. Strong high
raised walls <span class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">for</span> the community/ island, flood inundation mapping system and evacuation
points at different safe areas to minimize the loss of life.</p></div>
