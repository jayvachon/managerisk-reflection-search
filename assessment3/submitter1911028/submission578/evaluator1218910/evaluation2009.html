    <div class="field-value">It is clear from the review that the player learned from the game, and was able to draw specific conclusions from gameplay. I would have liked to see a bit more reflection on how studying the in-game threats would have helped them do better- it seemed like they were overly focused on wanting to know all of the details first, and then taking action. Part of having insurance is taking the action even though there is risk. In real life, I think that people tend to pay for two types of insurance; those they have to have (auto, health) and those they want to have (life, renters/home) rather than those that might be useful (crop, weather, umbrella, etc.). You're never going to have perfect information in any situation, but insurance lets you keep only the amount of risk you're comfortable with while still pursing developments (or hobbies, etc.).</div>
