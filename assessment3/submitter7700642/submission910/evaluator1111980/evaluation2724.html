    <div class="field-value">The key strenght of the reflection is that it tries to provide a description of the the mechanisms of the game and their relative importance within the game. The proposed solution for future upgrades of the game for sure also brings a viable option how to improve the game for future users. However, the comprehension is bit limited by the author's limited knowledge of English, which often decreases the clarity and impedes the understanding of the arguments. Dedicating more time to improving the usage of the language would thus for sure increase the quality of the text. </div>
