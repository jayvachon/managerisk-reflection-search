    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is a good understanding of setting the priorities to minimize the risk and potentially reduce the impact if/when disaster strikes.  I did not completely understand the the recommendation "that the building would randomly level up or be destroyed." I'm sure it is an idea that will enhance the learning objectives of the game, however I did not completely comprehend the thought.  Overall, nice job.</div>
