    <h1>Submission 2071 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8204982, session_user_id: cc2498b8f3275d6e18e3b460a2192337684b8b4c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management was to protect the pod and
community from Metroid. Since there is a limited time and money, trade-offs are
being made. In order to gain more knowledge about the risk, time must be spent
to observe the Metroid. Time is also needed to develop new constructions and
build protection. Obtaining protection is done with investing money. Money is
also needed when building and for insurance. Thus managing time and money is
important. Preparation for risk will use up resources which slows down
development. <br />
If I were to play the game one more time, I would start building protection in
the beginning and spend more time on observing the Metroid. Buying insurance is
also needed at aÂ later level, it is not needed in the beginning, I learned
that community collaboration and knowledge is especially important. Some time
it is more important than obtaining insurance or even having protection. Also,
effectively managing resources is the key to success. Even if there is a severe
problem, if the resources are managed properly, then the problem can be easily overcome.<br />
If I were to change one thing for the game, I would add that the building would
randomly level up or be destroyed. This is a very possible scenario where risk
is happened instantly without any warning. This way, the player must react to
random appearing situation and come up with the resources to best deal with the
problem. Building expanding randomly also symbolize booming economy which is expected in real life situation.<br /></p>
