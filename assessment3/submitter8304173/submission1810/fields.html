    <h1>Submission 1810 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8304173, session_user_id: f62c485ef7604594c82334e268c5fda3f96dcc1f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management helped players to evaluate the opportunity
to invest in the city while learning how to protect it from outside factors
using mitigation strategies (elevating the city) and insurance. Information played a pivotal role in this game because one could learn
if he or she had enough technology or mitigation strategies in place to protect
the city. For my risk and opportunity approach, I decided to build houses and use mitigation strategies at first. I bought
insurance when my research (the information presented on meteorites) informed
me that the probability of a shock was likely to happen and that my mitigation
was not enough to protect the capital invested in the city. Clearly, I did not
have enough capital and time to do everything at once: build capacity, research
about the risk (meteorites), invest in mitigation, buy insurance, and cope with the shock. For
example, if I used a lot of my time and resources to research about each meteorite,
I would not build the capital in the city. Similarly, if I used all my resources to mitigate and elevate the city (protection), I would not have sufficient money to develop it to
acceptable standards. The trade-off is, therefore, key to successful outcomes
in the game and in real life itself. One needs to decide what strategy gives the best utility.
Having the knowledge to make certain decisions and understand the short and long-term
impact of mitigation and coping strategies is of paramount importance to effective, sustainable development. </p>

<p>Fortunately, I had the opportunity to play the game more
than once and realize how to better use my time and resources in order to take
advantage of the opportunity and protect the city from imminent hazards.  I started to think about the relationship
between time and availability of resources – sometimes I had time left to use
the capital to invest in the city, but I did not have sufficient funds to do so
– as well as the importance of research for smart decision making and
management: It was not worthy to invest a lot of money to protect the city if I
was not allocating enough capital to build and develop the place. In fact, the more mitigation I used, the more expensive it became over time. </p>

<p>In regards to developing a new game, I would also create a
set of mitigation strategies with different costs and level of effectiveness.
Sometimes, ordinary citizens and governments have different opinions on how to
mitigate and cope with risks.  They need
to choose what mitigation or coping strategies they will use, if any at all. In bureaucratic environments, choosing what strategy to use is even more complicated. Hence, if people were able to choose which
strategies they would like to use at a specific time to protect the city (e.g. elevating
the city or building a wall), that would make the game even more realistic in
my point of view. </p></div>
