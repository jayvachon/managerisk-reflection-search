    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management plays a key role in city's developement. It helps the city prevent or reduce the loss, and recover quickly from the damage. When facing the choice of research, protection and insurance during the construction, I have to make a balance on time and cost. For example, too much money on building will make me no money on protection and insurance, which finally leads to the failure of the city development; too much time on research will make it no time for building and finally fail the game. It's of great importance to distribute the money and time rationally on construction, research, protection and insurance. By effective and efficient protection, loss can be prevented on most of the occasions; if not, it can reduce the loss at least. They both promote the development of the city.<br />When I played the game for the first time, I didn't have a plan. I spent as much money as I can on the buliding and didn't keep enough for insurance; I leveled up the protection as much as I can, never consider the severity of the damage which told the actual need of protection level. I did not connect the community to get a more powful city; I bought the insurance at will. Later I changed my strategy. I observed the comet constantly to get more accurate knowledge of the hit and more time for community connetion, as I found the information of the comet would change in the course; I leveled up protection according to the severity of the damage, which made the protection more effectively and economicly, as I found too high protection is a waste of money while too less protection will definitely made the city loss from damage; I bought the insurance according to the severity and chance of occurance. Through all these measures, I avoided most of the losses with least money and made it to the level 5. From the game, I also realized the other two points: firstly, overconfidence is wrong. A small probability of occurance does not mean it will never happen. We can not rely on the chance by luck but the sufficient preparation for the risk. Secondly, not all risk can be released by protection, which maybe because of too high cost or current technoledgy limit. So that's why insurance is necessary.<br />For the new version of the game, I would like to add the aid from outside city. Sometimes the damage is unavoidable and costly. Only by the city itself it is very difficult to recover from the damage or continue the construction. The main problem may be short of money. When I saw the time passing away but I could do nothing but waiting, it was really frustrating. If I can finance from outside or get other support, I will have more time for city construction.This may be also true in reality.<br /> </div>
