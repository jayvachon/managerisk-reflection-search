    <div class="field-value">Hi,
You have a good critical thinking ability. Referring to your answer in Question 2, your answer should  be in accordance to whether you have played the game once or more than once. From  a subjective point of view I suppose that investment in protection and up-gradation of the facilities should go hand-in-hand, otherwise the development goal will not be attained. Therefore there is a need for balanced approach.
In question 3 you made a wrong observation regarding research. Research cost  a nominal amount of $5 which is a one time cost. In reality the cost is prolonged in terms of money, time and skilled-manpower.
It was good overall, but in my opinion you could add slightly to where you had to write about reflection by relating it to the risk we face in everyday life.</div>
