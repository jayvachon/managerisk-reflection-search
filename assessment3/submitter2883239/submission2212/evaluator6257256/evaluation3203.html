    <div class="field-value">          The key strength of this reflection is clarity. Even though I am not a native English speaker I easily understood what happened in the game and lessons we can carry out from it.
            the thing that would make this reflection better is the way he/she could present it. I would have been like the author to present his work into three paragraphs as the questions were addressed. Otherwise the reflection is good. </div>
