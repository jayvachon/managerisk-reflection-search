    <div class="field-value">Very detailed analysis of how the writer managed to link the game with the course and topics covered so far, as well as how the writer changed behaviours to achieve a better result. Also interesting that the writer took a different path to me, so it's clear there are a number of ways to succeed in the game. The one thing I would add is a simple way to enhance the game (if a more sophisticated version isn't required).</div>
