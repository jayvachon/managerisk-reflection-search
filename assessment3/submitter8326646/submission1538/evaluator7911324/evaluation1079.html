    <div class="field-value">I think this essay shows that the full understanding regarding the game. This clarifies the key components of the game and how to succeed in the game. 
However, what I want to comment is that this focuses only on the game itself rather than connecting the game with the risk management of the course. If each component of the game is dealt with the risk management in the big picture, it would be the better reflection. </div>
