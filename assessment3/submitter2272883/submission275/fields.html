    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">RIsk Management helped me identify intensity of risk and prepare accordingly. it is a balancing act. We have to choose between best option in investment and community cooperation to mitigate risk. Its important to keep hawks eye on the risk and time it perfectly. Preparation for risk reduced the time to bounce back. I played this game multiple time learning new aspect every time i played. Key is to identify which risk, scale the risk, assess the damage it can cause. Once the risk is properly identified and its time to be prepare accordingly. Damage will be done but the key is to acquire enough knowledge to reduce the damage and be prepare to bounce back. If I could have more tools to identify the risk involved( which becomes more difficult if more number of risk are there) then i can activate the right training and utilize tools to mitigate it and be prepare. Would love to be able to see opportunities as i manage risk. The key is to prosper from it too.<br />Amazing game wish to play again and again.<br /></div>
