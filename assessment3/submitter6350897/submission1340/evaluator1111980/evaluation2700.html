    <div class="field-value">The key strenght of the reflection is the recommendation for upgrades for the new version of the game, which is up to the point and might bring some useful improvement, if applied properly. On the other hand, the text would benefit from more own insight of the author. Basically the first half of the reflection just summarizes the theory we have learned in the reading, does not bring anything new and only eats up the space which could be dedicated to more detailed relfection of the function and relation between the elements of the game.</div>
