    <h1>Submission 2330 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6561769, session_user_id: fc26829c320bdfd601d4c7d6d90dc7a05312c179)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>If it start
with the definition of risk management; as the process of confronting risk,
preparing for them, and coping with their effects; the role of the risk
management in the game show the importance to confronting risk, when you do not
know that these comes; so do the relevance of research and at the same time
that this allows to preparing as better as possible to confronting the risk.
The game shows that coping with the effects of the risk are better when you decide
invest in insurance and make alliances with the town.</p>

<p>The first
time that I play the game it was hard because I could not understand the
importance of the research and the alliances with the community; so the next
time that I play the game I did pay attention to the option of the insurance,
then to the importance of the communication with the village, and finally I
understood that the research is important but is more important take this
information and make the decision in the right moment, because if you decided
that protection is needed in the village when is late, the money that you
invest in it is money waste. So that, the resources invest in research will be
useful is take the information and take measures of control in order to
preparing for the risk before of it occurs.</p>

<p>Now summarize
my experience with the game is that the preparing for the risk affect in a
positive way because I could survive the second time that I played, because, I
insist, I did the research, I bought an insurance versus damage, I established communications
with the village and also I bought protection, so the result was that I
survived more levels. And this is a really good analogy with the life, if you
invest in protection for the event even if you are not sure that occurs, you
might be quiet when contingency happens.</p>

<p>For the
last, for my community it would be interesting introduce changes in order to
management the risk with the flood and landslides from hills, principally,
because we have others problems like the traffic every day because the streets
are not well planned and the different manifestations of various groups.</p>

<p>But, back
to the flood, I think that is really necessary that the people aware about the
importance because of the benefits of insurance versus risk of this kind. And
like long term plan the alliance with the government so that improve the sewer
system with infrastructure quality.</p>
