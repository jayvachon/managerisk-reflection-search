    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This games is very interesting. I've confused for a while, need more trial. Unfortunately, I tough this game was easy. I'm wrong. Maybe I should have more playing such this game.What interesting is how we should asses the speed of meteor and made a fast click for the research time. Oh it's frustrating me.  <br /><br />The role of this games is develop your managing risk "instinct", while the data is all about flow and time. You should have a fast decision and made an optimal choice within the trade-off condition.<br /><br />I still don't get the "hint" for beat this game. Maybe I should have more times playing this game. My strategies is always made a long rung preparation. But this game pushed me for a limited time and fasting clicking..<br /><br />In my opinion the game should made a human aspect. It;s quite difficult playing in sci-fi theme<br />  </div>
