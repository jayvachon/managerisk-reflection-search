<p> </p>

<p>The role of risk management in the
game was to ensure that the creation and subsequent development of an Alien
town, was not ruined by a major risk (incoming asteroids). Thus, whilst
developing the town, risk management was essential in order to not ruin the
development. Many things had to be taken into account, and preparing for these
possible risks was crucial. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The first choice I made was to obtain
at least basic insurance, as this would protect the development. Common
trade-off were between protection and insurance. I would ultimately make sure I
was insured, but always try to use the protection bar as much as possible. The
more I was prepared, the easier it was to deal with the effects of asteroids. Thus,
development actually become a lot easier. For instance, the researching the
potential threat of the asteroids aspect enabled me to prepare more, and
enabled me to make educated decisions about what I should do. Thus instead of
acting on pure conjecture, I could actually make approximations to how exactly
the asteroids would affect my development. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>After the first game, I realised the
importance of this. I had not researched the threats of the asteroids so much
before. After the first game though, I did. This allowed me to plan a lot more
extensively and appropriately. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I live in the Netherlands. So instead of asteroids, the risk would be
based around flooding. Thus, risk management would revolve around predicting
and dealing with flood risks. </p><span>
