    <div class="field-value">Its a very precise reflection wherein the methods and the methodology used in the game have been clearly articulated. However the writer failed to mention the proposals for better risk management at her place and also needs to work on the aspect of knowledge. Spending some more time on acquiring knowledge by researching the meteors would have helped in creating a lot of community connections which would have acted as protection and insurance thereby discounting the necessity of the protection level meeting the exact severity level of the meteor and giving more time for development of pods. Overall, a great reflection for a single attempt. :)</div>
