    <h1>Submission 1035 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 964293, session_user_id: a770c168f1b712ae795f1ff31ead26f05c2e373e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management as I know it is actually planning for risk,
installing features and plans, that will help cope with the vagaries of risk,
and as I have learned from the course, is trying to use risk in one’s favour
for improvement and development. Also from the course, I learnt that risk need
not be harmful, however, and is not always a burden. In many cases, people
hoping to improve their standards of living may voluntarily take on risk.
Indeed, risk taking is essential to the pursuit of opportunity. But those
opportunities may bring their own risks.</p>

<p><span>These values I gained from the Risk Horizon game I played. At
first I played for a few times without passing the level 1. This gave me
understanding of the important of research to evaluate the severity and
likelihood of the risk happen and as such cushioned my resolve and my
preparation to forestall the impending risk. 
I understood from the game that it is often when risks are mismanaged
that the consequences become severe, turning into crises with dire results.
Poor outcomes do not always reflect bad risk management, however: extremely
large and unexpected shocks can overwhelm even the best preparation. Such crises
have damaging effects because they not only affect current living conditions
but also weaken their ability and willing-ness to pursue new opportunities.</span></p>

<p>Also the planning of resources to mitigate or cope with risk
was also a key factor that I took out from the game. For the first five times
that I tried the game, I was always lack of funds to plan for the comets, and
most times, I was hit severely with a high very high damage rate,, but over
time, I could spread the resources and still manage the time efficiently. This
made me reach level 5.</p>

<p>A key lesson I also took away from the game is the importance
of insurance in preparing for risk and that crises can have substantial
economic costs and lead to large-scale loss of property, infrastructure, and
be-longings. While playing the game at first, I didn’t get the importance of
buying insurance, until I saw that it cost me more to repair after damage.
Buying insurance help me come back to ‘status quo’ in the shortest period, with
less resources consumed.</p>

<p>From the risk horizon game, I learnt that risk management is
an essential tool for development because every day we are exposed to many
risks, and an inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals.
The Risk horizon game gave me hands on means to plan and manage risks, with
more knowledge on the importance of research, insurance, resources and
planning.</p>

<p><span>On a concluding note, the risk horizon game gave me scope on
how risk could be better used for opportunity. From the game, I learnt risk
management may provide a means both to increase economic returns and re-duce
the propensity for crises. This could achieve after mastering the game and
utilizing all the available tools at my disposal to develop the pods, with less
damage as I progressed to higher levels.</span></p></div>
