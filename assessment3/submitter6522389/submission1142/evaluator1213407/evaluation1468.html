    <div class="field-value">The beginning of this reflection paper was quite strong and gave me the impression that the reflection following it would be just as strong. Unfortunately, my impression is that the description of what happened during the game took over the depth of your own reflection. Overall, I find your point of the non-existence of a "zero-risk" situation as an interesting one that deserves being developed further. As it is clear that you have some very good ideas, what I suggest next time is to concentrate on fewer ideas and to cover those more exhaustively so as to leave the readers themselves with a sense of "empowerment", too. Once again, thank you very much for your contribution. Good luck with your final project and successful completion of this course!</div>
