    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that, the person writing it has clearly phrased what he understood from the game, also the minute specifications of the game reflects that it has been understood properly.

The one thing that would make the reflection better is further linkage of the game with the readings and the videos of that weekâ€™s resources.</div>
