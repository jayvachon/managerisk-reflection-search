    <h1>Submission 1034 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7049920, session_user_id: 02771add70c4c192f08e6a9ad024e493ad592c3b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Note: I only got to level 2 and my code is wTktNq9 <br /><br />1. The role of risk management in this game was to consider the likely outcomes for action/decisions which you have made, in response of information presented to you. The information then gives you your personal opinion of risk against how to reduce/manage that risk. The trade off is that you have limited resources of time and money in which to chose different options which have different results. Preparation for risk affects development in that it would allow you to insure against damage, and therefore reduce future costs were a damaging event to occur. It does however take up resources in terms of the costs of insurance against costs of new build and improvements to reduce damage from flooding. <br /><br />2. Playing the game again would be much quicker. I spent time reading things carefully and as you learn the game more and more you understand the consequences of risks and actions much better. I would ensure a high level of insurance and speedier build earlier on, and try to get to a higher level of housing as soon as possible, but realising the finite resource and how much money is remaining. Once I established the timing of the money increasing, I would do things immediately the money "came in" so my focuses would be much different in terms of speed of response. Knowing the affect of a change is so important and as you learn the game you realise that some can be expensive but make little different whereas a longer term issue of insurance and research has a different result. Writing this assignment actually made me understand so much more about risk and planning for risk and the compromises and cause and affect.<br /><br />3. I don't know how you could incorporate it but perhaps a multi player game where the players had different focuses, as is the case between a health department of government, and perhaps a disaster planning departments. The department does not matter but the issues of different departments wanting their share of the cake would be interesting as often, for example, a country is considering shelters for protection against such things as typhoons/flooding but at the same time the government wants to build roads and infrastructure, and the choices of saving lots of lives early on, against building infrastructure which increases economic activity leading to higher GDP, tax base etc, which gives the government more to spend on disaster planning in the longer term. It would show in even more detail the consequences of decisions, speed of decisions, compromises and medium and longer term issues.</div>
