    <h1>Submission 531 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6020658, session_user_id: 6b209245e6e4b8a8cd22eab002d8d3bc5e0db913)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game provides an interesting, though oversimplified, application of
risk management. Research, protection and insurance all have to be considered
in order to make it to the fourth level and upper. The players have to adapt
their strategy, if they are to succeed in coping with the tsunamis generated by
the falling comets.<span><br /><br /><span>Committing
the right amount of money at the right time lets the player increase his or her
development score. But
the importance of each variable changes over time. For instance, at some point,
when investment in protection has proved sufficient to efficiently shield
buildings from floods, insurance is not much of a factor any more. Again, the
goal is to develop, not to indulge in a spending frenzy over protection and
insurance. Research stands apart from the two other variables, in so far as it
is free (which is absolutely not the case in real life). I mostly used research
as a pastime to fill in the gaps, when I was waiting for money to add up.</span><br /><br /><span>I
played the game three times in a row, and I got much better at appreciating the
right level of protection and insurance needed, on a par with the expected
severity of impacts. In doing so, I was able to exceed the expectations of each
level and see the green bar fill up rapidly. I understood that costly upgrades
are not worthy unless the overall development of buildings is balanced - better
have many average buildings than a few good ones. And while a responsible risk
manager cannot rely on fate alone, I also realized that luck is paramount, as
the number of comet hits vary from one to four per turn! My strategy
could be summed up as follows: build all pods as soon as possible in order to raise mney quickly, invest in
insurance to the max, then, in upper levels, focus on development and protection,
leaving insurance on the side when protection is sufficient. With this scheme of maneuver, you may be able to reduce the impact of risk management investments on your development.</span><br /><br />
I live in a place that is, luckily, not prone to natural disasters. Nevertheless, I can think of a few simple ways the game could be changed in order to better represent
risk management choices. First, comet hits should result in earthquakes as well
as floodings. Therefore, elevation would not prevent all damages, and insurance
would be necessary to recover from the hits. Then, research should be paid for,
as in real life. Research is nothing like looking at the stars, it needs a real
commitment. For example, the player could build a telescope and upgrade it in
order to better assess the risk of impact. And finally, research shouldn't be
too accurate - varying weather conditions from one level to the other could
impair the capability to track comets. Overall, the player would have to mix
even more all three variables to succeed in his or her quest for development.<br /><br /><span>Risk
horizon is a funny approach to a handful of risk management principles. A true example of the
widespread gamification in nowadays education, it provides a swift look at the necessary balance between development and risk management investments. Its simplicity makes it quite intuitive,
but after a few tries, the interest for our little pods  fades away. I would gladly try a renewed
version with more difficulties to handle. Thinking of other games involving risk management,
I would recommend SimCity for those who wish to see their development
strategies face a myriad of risks, ranging from natural disasters to chemical
pollution and even crime.</span><br /><br /><br /></span></p></div>
