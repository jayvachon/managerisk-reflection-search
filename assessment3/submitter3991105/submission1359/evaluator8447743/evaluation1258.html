    <div class="field-value">I really liked this reflection as it aimed to answer all the questions, explained the main concepts learned throughout two weeks and demonstrated a clear learning during game. Tradeoffs between different types of risk management techniques were demonstrated very thoroughly. The player understood the relationships between resources needed for minimizing and avoiding the damages and development. A powerful conclusion was made in the end. Proceeding through levels and playing the game multiple times taught the author that there is no one universal rule and perfect risk management tool. Rather all the components must be balanced and used simultaneously.

As for the negatives, overall I really liked the reflection. Maybe only one thing can be added. Ways of how preparation for risks affects development could be discussed a bit further. For example, it may have been stated that expenditures on protection, insurance and research are immediate, i.e. impose costs straight away. However their benefits are available only after the shock hits. Therefore in the short term it might seem like costs of risk preparation outweigh the immediate benefits. However, after the shock occurs, preparation makes it much easier to cope with it and that's where the apparent benefits of the effective risk management come in.
