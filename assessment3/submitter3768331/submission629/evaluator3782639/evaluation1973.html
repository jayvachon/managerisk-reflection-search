    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is the description of the student realizing some main lessons from the game: confronting and managing risks instead of fearing them is crucial for development; risks can be shared to better confront them. The student is clearly taking away from this game the importance of risk management for the purpose of development. The reflection could be further improved by adding some thoughts about the trade-offs confronted between knowledge, protection and insurance, realizing that not all is possible at the same time.</div>
