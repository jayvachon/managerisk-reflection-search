    <div class="field-value">Key strength
The student obviously has a clear understanding of the different tools of risk management as highlighted in this course
What could make the reflection better
The reflection was more of a description of the game as against trying to relate it to relate with it practically; reflection would have been better if the student had related knowledge to real life.
