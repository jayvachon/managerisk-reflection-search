    <div class="field-value">Clarity is the key strength of this essay. It was very easy for me to understand how the learner experienced the game. 

However, I disagreed in a point related to the comprehension of the material and its link with the game experience: the learner does not identify the role of the risk management (see second paragraph, first sentence). Thus, one thing that would make this reflection better would be a better illustration of the role of the risk management.

Overall, it is a clear reflection of the learning experience, but with some flaws in the comprehension and linkages with the course's material.</div>
