    <div class="field-value">The author's reflection on the game is above average. It is appreciated how the author describes the purpose of the game and the challenges she faced. It is also clear that the author has a good understanding on the development issues and I liked the proposed changes for upgrading the game. The only thing I missed in the game reflection was a deeper self-refletion, because from the text it is not understandable, what steps the author took in the game, what she did wrong according to herself and what she would do in other way for the next time. Overall impression is superior, though.</div>
