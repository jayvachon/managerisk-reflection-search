    <h1>Submission 1935 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8060549, session_user_id: 0a63db4dd0dc89fe4f49c777156c4557b32be05c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Game Reflection according to the questions followed as a guide and the conclusions i gathered after i played Risk Horizon</strong>:<br /><br /> Risk Management in the game has the role to balance research, protection, insurance and community development.<br /> Community connections are a type of insurance. <br />When disaster strikes we help each other survive by sharing resources.<br /> Forming and sustaining connections is so valuable.<br />Preparation to Risk Management has to occur the sooner the better.<br /><br />RESEARCH<br />Before a disaster, we should not worry to do community connections, but instead try spending more time on research, especially for more severe shocks, in this case, comets.<br />The more research, the more time we will have to prepare!<br />Even the information we have about shocks is not perfect, the more we research them, the  more accurate our information becomes. <br />That ´s why severity and chance of hit change as we spend more time on research.<br /><br />PROTECTION<br />Regarding protection, even a little bit of it goes a long way. Even if the pods are damaged, they will be damaged less if we are protected. This make them easier to repare.<br /><br />Conclusion: the role of Risk Management is to mitigate the losses ( in this case) and improve the benefits that people experience when they face risk ( in this case) and opportunity.<br />The perceived benefit of Risk Management depends on assessment of the likely size of a future shock, the probabiliy of it occurring, and how much people care about the future ( when the benefits of Risk Management would accrue) compared with the present. (when the costs are undertaken).<br /><br /><span>If i played the game only once, i would try from the beginning to dedicate more time in building more pods and upgrade them, and more time in research.<br /> If i played the game more than once, after the first time i would try to enhance protection for not being destroyed  so easily and enhace also by these means, community development.<br /><br />.I learned from the game the importance of a right balance between: knowledge, protection, insurance, community development, and this is exactly what we are trying to learn when we talk about an effective Risk Management.<br /></span><br />To better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i live, I would propose to change the comets for economics measures coming from the government.<br /> It was a very interesting way to learn!<br />Thank you!<br />Cecilia Costa Vilar<br /><br /></div>
