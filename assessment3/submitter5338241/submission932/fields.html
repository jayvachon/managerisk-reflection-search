    <h1>Submission 932 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5338241, session_user_id: ab7ceb5990d5216dae4a6fadb0d8c0daeddd566b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was the better control
and secure of the development of the community. I tray, first to protect community
investisment against
the waves by building plot on the land then get information’s about each comet and take insurance. As trade-offs in
terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance I have the time and the money. The
risk manager needs time to research, to protect and to insure. This time is to
short. The speed and frequency of events that produced shocks on the community
and damage development is very high. In another hand he needs money to make
researches on the risk, protect the community and insure de development investisment
(infrastructures, houses, equipments, and so one). This money is not always
available. So the manager needs to calculate every time.

<p>Preparation for risk affects development because
it reduces the intensity of shocks and damages, help people or the community to
repair damages and to recovery development after shocks. It also reduces de
cost of the reconstruction. After some time preparation make total control of
the risk.</p>

<p>I played the game more than once. It took me
about 12 hours to won the first level. I won level 2 and lost level three. The
first line up I use was: protection (building plot), research information about
comet coming, buying insurance and protection. After shock, I use to repair
damages, get information’s about de next comet, try to invest (build development).</p>

<p>First : The that risk management is a very
complex task because the manager has to be intelligent, prompt to react. Every
time his is searching information’s about risk, securing investisment, searching
money and man power. Second: there is the “incertitude” of some risk. During
the game although research indicates that the comet is going to cause severity
damages the comet missed. Before the missed, the manager has invested in the
security (protection and insurance). Third : if the risk manager failed he is
going to lost all the investisment. For example I reach three time level 2.
When I failed at level 3 I have to restate the game at level 1. So risk manager
have to take care every time to make sure that investisment are well secured. Fourth:
the risk manager has to be very sensible. In game there is a signal when comet
are coming then another when is going to heat. If the risk manager does not
detect the signal he cannot secure the community. Five: there is a difference between
the theory and the practice of risk management. In practice the risk manager
have a short time to do a lot of work. He need collaborators. </p>

<p>This game is very instructive. If there is something
to add it may be a bank. At this level, the player cannot control the financial
aspects of the game.<br /></p><br /></div>
