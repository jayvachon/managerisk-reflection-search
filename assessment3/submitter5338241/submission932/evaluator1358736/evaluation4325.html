    <div class="field-value">The suggestion made to add a bank was a good idea and would be interesting to see how it would play out if there was a financial institution present and how it would be able to support the player. The essay had some important and valuable points to convey and the student has an understanding on how risk management can be carried out, however, some of the grammatical errors made the essay a bit unclear and confusing.</div>
