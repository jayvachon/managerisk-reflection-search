    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">  <br /><ul><li><span style="font-style:normal;"><em>1. What was the role of risk management in the game?-----?</em></span></li></ul><i><br /></i>The role of risk management in the game is the Luminator of Alora and the pods.  When I confront the situation in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance, I will deal with the completed risk process of a project in fact.  From a risk management perspective, the Power of Research is to analyze and determine the risk. The Power of Protection is to decrease and reduce the risk. The Power of Insurance is to restore and remedy the risk damage. There are three strategy preparations for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time). The strategy 1 is to attain more wealth value, to research the severity and chance of hit of comets, to reduce the loss. Of course, “each action will cost you precious resources!”. So the strategy 2 is to utilize the limited wealthy resources as efficiently as possible. The strategy 3 is to balance between growing our community and preparing for these potential shocks. Although you have a right strategy and you are always hurry-scurry at first, it was impossible to do well in fact. <i><br /><br /></i><i>2. If you played the game only once,------?<br /></i><br />In first several games, I excessively pay attention to the accumulation of wealth value and ignored the risk reduce-- raise your village against waves caused by comets hit and the restore from risk---insurance. So I was defeated at once and did not pass the level one even. I learned from the failures that you must have been failure frequently if you do not have any risk management awareness.  When I play the game more and more, I more and more realize that it is the one key of success to balance your development with protecting against comets!  Of course, another key  factor is to utilize the limited wealth value as efficiently as possible.  From the game, I leaned the three helpful experiences.  The experience 1 is that we should pay more attention on a risk management and have a practical risk strategy in every project. The experience 2 is to define a process of assessing by an international or national standard process and achieve the goal of risk management and decision analysis and resolution process areas. The experience 3 is that the special and practical risk prevention and control measures are necessary. <br /><br /><br /><ul><li>3<em>.The game captures,--------?</em><br /></li></ul><br />In my opinion, this game is an impressive training session of risk management. If I have a chance to develop a new version of the game, I will add a risk factor from the internal community of Alora compared with a risk factor from external risks (comets). For example, excessive community of Alora in a limited area will make a poisonous substance (maybe similar with an algae toxin). The poisonous substance will destroy pods to decrease the development value.  I live in China at now. There are numbers of natural disasters every year. Although Chinese central government has an emergency management and rescue team system, the some disasters still cause severe losses because local officials only have limited risk management knowledge. So the Chinese local officials have to study the process of risk management further. They should realize that the risk management goal is to measure and control risks so that risk can be mitigated to a specified acceptable level. <br /></div>
