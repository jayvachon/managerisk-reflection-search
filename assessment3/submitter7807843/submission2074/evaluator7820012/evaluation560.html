    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the detailed account of the 'learning and adjustment process' during the game. Unfortunately, the author focusses more on describing what he did, rather than truly reflecting on the learning process. The main weakness, however, is the apparent lack of references to the body of knowledge that has been gained so far throughout the course. While the author uses the concepts of risk management vaguely but more or less correctly there is no true application of what was learned throughout the course to the game itself (essentially an answer to question 1 is avoided). </div>
