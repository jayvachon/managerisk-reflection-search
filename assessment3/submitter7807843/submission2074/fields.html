    <h1>Submission 2074 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7807843, session_user_id: 159d285402beae529aecd62c50db13c52866ef4f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The first time I played, I think I made level 4. That was on Sunday. Since then, till Thursday when I made level 5, I couldn't clear level 3. <br /><br />At first I didn't worry about my 'limited resources'. They kept increasing- enough for level 2 or 3 insurance, continuous pod building/ upgrading. The almost unchanged colour meter was reassuring.<br />So I continuously developed till I was broke, spent less time on research and making connections. I tried to diversify-some level one, some two, some three. I figured insurance with elevation would help me out. It didn't work.<br /><br />But I'd forgotten how unpredictable the comets could be. Just when I was about to clear a level, they'd hit.<br /><br />So I became scared and researched more. Now I was developing less but researching <strong>every</strong> comet enough for protection. Still didn't work.<br /><br />It was when I splurged just before finally clearing level 3, that I saw the meter fall, and I failed to clear. Watching it rise when I upgraded pods, I finally understood that even the growth had to be balanced. But I was now spending too much time on the comets. <br /><br />So I took chances, and let the less dangerous comets go, used the time to let some pods develop and then go back to researching the tougher ones. Of course, at the beginning of every level, I increased island level (less later, as I was spending more time than was useful) and bought insurance.<br /><br />The final ingredient came when I hit the full meter on level 1, saw the surplus carried over to level 2 and so on till level 5. Every spot was filled with pods, at least level 2, and most level 3, some 4.<br /><br />To me playing this game helped me understand a number of things:<br /><br />1) Balance: Too much development or too much risk, and I didn't make it. But only spending a certain percentage of income at a time, choosing the high risk targets to research helped me clear levels more.<br /><br />2) Management: <br />- First, not for cumulatively increasing but sustainable growth. <br />- Second, taking proper insurance, research/elevation for increasing protection was reassuring, when upgrading higher plots. <br />- Third, prioritising which pods to develop, so they would finish developing within the limited time on the clock.<br /><br />If any, maybe time turned out to be my only trade-off- trying to develop as much as possible within 2 1/2 minutes. Once I understood that long term growth- the carryover of surplus from the previous level-  was more important than short term unsustainable development, time became less of a constraint.<br /><br />Where I lived, in Bangalore in India, a choice was- to start or not start a business. But for that you need capital, and since you don't have it, you borrow. The feature I would add to the game therefore, is a micro-finance institution, for taking loans.<br /></div>
