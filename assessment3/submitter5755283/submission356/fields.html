    <h1>Submission 356 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5755283, session_user_id: 57fd585137caa284d97d98e77838c7c8410c0c17)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Effective
and efficient management of risk is key to achieve success in the game, which
involves not only c<strong>urrent resources and risks</strong>, but also the <strong>forecasts of resources
and possible future risks</strong>. Time and resources are limited, both for the
consecution of objectives (building a successful colony) and for the prevention
of any events that might hinder the consecution of said objectives (meteorites),
which made necessary the development of a risk management strategy in order to
administrate them: economic resources spent on preventive measures (building a
dam), or in provision of possible issues (insurance) cannot be spent in the
achievement of the final objective, and it occurs similarly with the time spent
in risk assessment (meteorite research) and preparing against risk materialization.
</p>

<p>In my case,
I played the game several times; as I played, it became obvious that it was more
efficient in the long run to spend time and resources in preventive tasks and
risk assessment than to focus merely in the day-to-day work and apply
palliative measures in case the risks do materialize. Risk prevention is much
more effective if <strong>prepared in advance</strong>, as time and resources are spent evenly
throughout the game, and not in a single point in time, by which it might be
too late to be of any effect.</p>

<p>Having a
<strong>clear risk management strategy, tailored to each individual situation</strong>, and
following its guidelines was key to the achievement of successful objectives,
be them the construction of new pods, or the improvement of the economy of a
certain region. </p>

<p>Finally, if
I were to develop a new version of the game, and taking into account where I
live, Spain, which is part of the European Union, I would add the possibility
of <strong>requesting aid from nearing pod colonies</strong>. Of course, that would also mean the
possibility that the own player would be requested to help other colonies in
turn. </p>

<p><span>The
European Union has many preventive directives, and takes an active role in
establishing common guidelines for all countries belonging to it, as sometimes
it is much more efficacious to apply measures at a higher level, as a
community, than it would do as a smaller, less powerful entity.Â </span></p></div>
