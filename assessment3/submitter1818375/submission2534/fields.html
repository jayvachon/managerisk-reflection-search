    <h1>Submission 2534 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1818375, session_user_id: 91705243e50429b1e17a484251310b7f786765b3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. The risk
management has a crucial role in the game, because we must choose a combination
between Knowledge (asteroid danger), Insurance (for better reconstruction) and
Protection (keeping green level) in order to be prepared before the asteroid
impact and minimize the effects. This is a typical risk chain.</p>

<p><span>My choice
was to build (and reconstruct) as soon as possible, but always with the higher
insurance. At the same time I was monitoring the asteroid danger and was afraid
with the level of protection. </span></p><p><span>Higher risk (lower insurance , lower knowledge of
asteroid danger , or lower protection) always conducted to loss the level
because I could not be able to rebuild in time. It was better an intermediate
option to  develop the game.</span></p>

<p></p><span></span><p>

<br /></p><p>2. My first
time was frustrating, but however I enjoyed next times. I did´t pass level two,
but I can learn some lessons fron the experience.</p><p><span>

I
le</span>arned that the best option was always using a certain level of insurance, and
that  I must rebuild as soon as possible
after impacts. Knowledge from asteroid danger was useful, but protection was
more useful. </p><p><br /></p><p></p>

<p>3. I don´t
use to play video games. It was hard to me the way to reinforce constructions,
linking together, after impacts. I acknowledge and congratulate the creators of
the game, because the simpler it will be more useful for those not usually
play. The game is a fun good job. </p>

<p><span>If I had to
propose a change, my advice was to improve the instructions, expanding them, in
order to help people not familiar with video games.<span class="_wysihtml5-temp-placeholder"></span></span></p></div>
