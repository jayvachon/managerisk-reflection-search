    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the effort made to link the elements of the game to the learnings of the course.

Has this reflection been longer (it was only approx. 240 words) it would have allowed more depth to improve upon the reflection.  Also, this assignment would have been better had it addressed all three questions which, again, would have brought more depth of understanding to the reflection.</div>
