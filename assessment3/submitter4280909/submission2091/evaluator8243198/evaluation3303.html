    <div class="field-value">this reflection shows that the person knew what was his weaknesses while playing but he didnt knew how to overcome then.It does not clearly highlights the roles of different tools of risk management.But the suggestions to make the game better were nice and the ideas were clearly captured.
If the reflection were to highlight the roles of different tools of risk management it would have been better.</div>
