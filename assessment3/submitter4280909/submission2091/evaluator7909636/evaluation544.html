    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the student understood the importance of this simulation and was able to understand the need for a strategy.
How the student played the game is not much described it would have been better if the student had focused on the strategy and the learning he/she received from this game.
More details about the entire experience would have been better particularly the course of action that he/she took and the learning he/she received as to what is the action and consequence of each strategy that a player can adopt.</div>
