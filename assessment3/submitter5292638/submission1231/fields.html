    <h1>Submission 1231 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5292638, session_user_id: 57652c8995f44a07132195b65c581c39053112f5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management covers risk identification, estimation, mitigation, monitoring and management. In the game, It was the duty to create asset, protect manpower and asset from Primary threat ie Commet
In the Game, It was the duty to create asset and opting insurance to protect asset from risk and doing research to reduce the risk. One person can not protect the common threat. We should seek the cooperation of all members to protect the common threat. Effective potential of community protection is better than the individual protection. Law of diminishing return indicates that return from investment has certain limitation. Return on Investment decreases after certain number of community members
Risk Management involves brainstorming about threat to community. Some member must have Technical knowledge to asses the future risk and take corrective measures to avoid risk.
Example: Individual effort protected a under developed and mountainous village  from recurring crop damage due to drought. One and only educated Village Agriculture graduate convinced Village people to construct a CHECK DAM in mountainous stream by own effort without assistance from Government. Check Dam protected  crop  from damage due to irregular rainfall. Installation of solar Panel solved lighting problem
If we unite and share our limited resources for  common cause, We can avoid risk for common benefit</div>
