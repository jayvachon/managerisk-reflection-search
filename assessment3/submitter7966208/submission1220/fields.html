    <h1>Submission 1220 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7966208, session_user_id: 4598d16628ffc8bd3bd35cab95e2ce3cd2d9d62a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game was a well-constructed
hypothetical situation of risk management; preparing before shocks and coping
afterward, highlighting its importance as an essential tool for development. Alongside
building and upgrading the pods that would increase the rate of development,
represented by the development bar on the left, there was a need to watch out
for comets that were what we call shocks in reality. This accounts for
obstacles and constraints that stand in the way of responsible and effective
risk management, and tackling them. In an attempt to keep a balance between
development and preparing for risks, I had to distinguish between three
different risk management activities; research, also known as knowledge in
reality, protection and insurance. Using the power of research by keeping the
comet’s box focused on the screen for as long as I could, I acquired as much
knowledge as I could about the approaching comet (shock), assessing its
severity and chances of hit. In the first few attempts of the game I would
spend only a two or three bars on research, however after a couple of tries, I
realised prolonging the time spent on research had a positive effect, reducing
the impact on the pods as I attained more time to connect to communities just
before the comet would hit. However, the challenge I faced was that the more
time I spent on research, the more I was compromising on the time that could be
spent on protection. Although in the first few tries of the game, I did spend
relatively more time on protection, in the latter few tries, I spent more time
on research as mentioned above. Given a number of insurance plans to choose
from, what I had to consider was the amount of resources available at hand.
Torn between choosing an effective insurance plan and protection that was
draining resources, I would choose to employ the insurance plan that may have
been the most expensive at times but in the long-term it turned out to be the
correct decision, as it reduced the cost of repairs for the damage caused by
the comets. This signifies the importance of long-term planning. At times, due
to shortage of resources, I had to choose the cheapest insurance plan in the
beginning, but as I gained resources by developing and upgrading the pods, I
would change my insurance plan to a new and improved one. And on the other
hand, at times due to a huge chunk of my resources being spent on the insurance
plan, there was a lack of resources, limiting my ability to upgrade the pods,
thus slowing the pace of development of the community. I learned that risk
preparation is highly correlated with income, and most importantly there is a need
of careful planning and management to balance the time and resources available
in a framework of obstacles, by thinking more strategically about the return
over a long period of time. Moreover, to better represent the risk management
choices that matter, I would propose to add another aspect of risk management
that deals with a positive change such as technological improvement or a
resource boom, and an indication of how to take advantage of it, clearly indicating
the significance of developing upon new opportunities alongside threats.  </p></div>
