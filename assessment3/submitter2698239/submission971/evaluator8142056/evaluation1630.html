    <div class="field-value">Key Strength
There is obvious clarity and comprehension of not only the game, but the whole idea behind the game by the student. From all indications, am of the opinion that this demonstrates the fact that the student truly has a good grasp of the topic.

One thing that I think would make this reflection better
I think the student has done a good reflection.</div>
