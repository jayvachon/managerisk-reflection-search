    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">        The role is an incident which affect whole community can happen anytime. I improved homes to increase overall rentability. When a huge trheat should happen I called upon an insurance plan, avaliating potentional risk first. I played this game 3 times, I did a risk knowledge even more i played, because just fix damages aren't enough. I learned risk management tools are important to avoid risks. <br />      In a development of this game i would put in financial risk, based in risk value and moral hazzard. Because in emerging countries credit limts assurance capabilities. Financial plans shrink protetion in risk areas because of money available. Assurance companies use burocracy to increase their profits.    <br />    </div>
