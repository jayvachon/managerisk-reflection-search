    <h1>Submission 455 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1705799, session_user_id: 1be110dd9541c2eafd6faad980fdb1681ab55b88)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">  We were tasked to play a game which had an objective of risk management.  I was expected to determine where to allocate funds in order to develop the "country."  The risks presented were comets coming at the country.  I chose most often to protect the country and insure it against natural disaster.  By doing this, I was unable to develop the country to it's capacity.  I made fewer pods and did not develop the pods to a higher level.  I did, however, protect the country from a great deal of damage from comets.  Initially, protecting against losses was easier because developing a small country took less resources.  After a while, however, it became more difficult to protect the country while maintaining a steady development due to the increased resources development was taking.<br />  I played the game a couple of times to try to better understand the concepts and functions.  If I were to play it again, I would develop more of my country as it got bigger instead of putting my resources towards protection.  I did find it most valuable to have the country insured against the comets.  The first time I played I did not protect enough at the beginning, which I am starting to believe is where it is most beneficial to develop your protection.  I mostly learned that there is a balance to be achieved between development, insurance, and protection when managing a country.  If you put too many of your resources into one of those three areas, you will not be able to survive a natural disaster.  I also learned that it was impossible to predict when natural disaster might occur, and sometimes you can be over-prepared and lose an opportunity to develop the country.<br />  If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would change one simple thing.  I would allow for more opportunity to research the comets.  By having greater opportunity for research, I could better determine where my resources are needed.  At times during the game I over-insured or over-protected, simply because I did not know enough about the comet and what risks it presented.  In order for the game to better reflect where I live, I would change the comets to tornadoes and the pods into neighborhoods.  Protection would look different due to the different dynamics a tornado presents, but the insurance and development would be quite similar.</div>
