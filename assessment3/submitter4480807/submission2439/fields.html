    <h1>Submission 2439 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4480807, session_user_id: 5710eebdf21e57177384bed7ff43fbe83168f773)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game "Risk Horizon" is a real time strategic game which requires strategic thinking and teaches how and why risk management is important for healthy development.I started the game with building plots and raising the ground level continuously.To find out the risk with a comet,it has to be observed continuously and severity and chances of the comet hitting have to be taken into consideration to take the appropriate insurance plan to reduce the risk involved.To do well in the game you need to think strategically - meaning think about the balance between preparing for risk and investing in developing the community.We also need to invest heavily in protection and not just insurance.If we spend too much in building and upgrading pods,you will be exposed to comets when they hit. When you sustain damage from comets,the progress bar gets decreased.On the other hand, if you spend too much on preparation for risk, you will not have enough money to develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.<span>This is a balance policy makers have to consider all the time. They have limited resources, so there is a tension between spending up front on risk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but may not hit) or to spend on other development priorities.<br />After playing many times,what i observed specific to the game was that money should not be kept as reserve and b</span>uild and upgrade as many pods as you can early on in the game.Development helps you in succeeding the game.We have to figure out the best way to prepare for incoming shocks.The goal is to make Alora florish.The balance between risk preparation and development is difficult to achieve.As shown in the videos of lecture,risk management plays an important role and we should always try to reduce the risk involved.There are three strategies which can be used in the game.They are power of research,insurance and protection.We should focus on building the pods as fast as possible and then spend time on researching incoming comets so that we can be prepared for any danger.When disaster hits,there should not be any obstacles to provide help and steps should be taken to do it as fast as possible in real life.<span> Despite significant progress in risk analysis, from better weather forecasting to more experience and knowledge about macroeconomic crises, people and institutions often under utilize the existing knowledge on past disasters and response to them.</span></div>
