    <h1>Submission 2462 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7479059, session_user_id: cb91bb4a38c049d406f3a19c34aabacec75ddd2f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>In my opinion, the main
role of risk management in the game is determining and explain the chain of the
prominent components of risk management. Its also to show the importance of
each other features in terms of interconnection.  First of all I tried to protect my buildings
by buying the most expensive insurance plan. In the meantime I tried to reveal
the degree of danger each comets and also to develop my buildings in terms of
limited recourses. The main trade- off is to renewing of buildings or buying
more protective insurance plan. Doing that I was forced to choose between
buying better insurance plan and creating the new type of buildings. Having
said I guess that the main trade-off is the consideration to pick a renewing
option of buildings or to buying more protective insurance plan. But the preparation
bears fruits a little bit latter.</span></p>

<p>In the circumstances, if
I played the game only once my attention would be more closely to the
researches of disaster probability. The correct risk assessment could safe your
recourses by proper using it. For example, if you see a probability of a little
scale of damage you shouldn’t buy the more expensive insurance plane. If I
played the game more than once I would try to change my steps by paying more
attention to researches or to timing of buying specific insurance plan in one
way and the more faster development of the buildings in another way. The
dynamic growing as well is the key part of archiving sustainable society. Not
only research and protection, but also development. In the end I learned that
doing research on time – is the key to success of creating proper insurance and
protection.</p>

<span>By creating the new version of the game I`d find it
very useful to look at providing better researches to each potential disasters.
Another important area I see in offering more range of insurance plans. Since
you do better research and therefore better appropriate potential losses you
can choose better insurance plan which more closely for your strategy of
development. At second it would be more interesting to play if we add a lot of
variety kinds of disasters, frequency of events. Also player has to opt a
different campaigns in the game which are more close to reality (not only
disaster of falling comets). I feel very strongly that it could get better
playing process by bringing more skills to the players in terms of better risk
assessment, providing proper protection in their ways of development.</span></div>
