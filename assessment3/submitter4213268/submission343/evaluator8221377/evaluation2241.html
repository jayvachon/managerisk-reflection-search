    <div class="field-value">Your writing on the game is missing one very important point - any mentioning of reflection on the basic interplay of knowledge, protection, and insurance. Having had included an insight in this direction, your mark would have been higher that what it is.
Nonetheless, your essay shows other important bits and bobs you understood - mostly apparently about yourself. Whatever your motivation for taking this course is, it is clear that if you want to make full use of what you learned, you need to calm down and go for it again. You may or may not enjoy football, but your essay reminded me of one thing I heard last week at one point before the final between Germany and Argentina and it seems to suit here like a hand in a glove.
Bastian Schweinsteiger's (Germany's midfielder) quote: "There is huge anticipation here and in Germany. We have no pressure. We know how to handle things. We just have to concentrate on our jobs and what makes us strong. We have to be calm and have clear heads focused on the football."
It is clear to see the parallel to this game and, in fact, to any situation you need to put risk management to work.. Good luck.</div>
