    <div class="field-value">I think that this reflection was the ideal reflection for the game. the student understood the game well and was able to relate in to the world really well. In the student's reflection he/she showed a good command over the technical terms as well as knowledge concerned with risk management.
I think that I may have made was that I would have also added the consequences of a meteor strike and how it affects development in the short and the ling run.</div>
