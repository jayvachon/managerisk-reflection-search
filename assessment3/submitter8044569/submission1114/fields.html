    <div class="field-value">Reflection on the game

The game demonstrated how knowledge (research), protection, insurance and coping (building community connections) help mitigate and cope with risk. It also provoked an assessment of the  trade-offs to be taken when making decisions regarding risk management – especially in cases when resources are constrained. For example – does one invest in infrastructure (housing/ pods or broad protection) or does one invest in insurance? The game also made me choose between investing precious time in research or spending time in other activities such as building/ development, buying insurance or developing protection.

The more prepared I was for an event – through research, protection and by having insurance – the better I withstood the events. The community links were stronger and I was able to build on the community links after an event. This, together with insurance meant that the damage I sustained was much less when hit by a severe meteor. It also cost less to invest in broad societal protection, low insurance and research (which 'cost time') than paying for high insurance. I was finally able to advance higher in the game when I paid less for higher insurance and put more money into development (by spending more on pods) and by increasing protection for society (to prevent the negative event). The rewards or benefits were higher for reducing risk for society as a whole and developing it than for trying to deal with the consequences of a negative event. 

I did better when I had a higher level of development. Income was higher when I had more pods and when I had invested more in the pods. This generated more income for me and society prospered.

I was able to gain more time to build community connections after I was struck by an event when I had spent more time researching an event. When I had more time building community connections after being struck by a negative event, the damage was often less severe. This was not only beneficial in terms of sustaining less damage, but it also helped in that I was able to focus on developing my island and preparing for other negative shocks.

A lesson I learned was that the solution is not found in any one component, and that trade-offs are constantly being made in a changing context and under time constraints. This means that risk management practitioners have to be constantly analysing risks and opportunities, as well as changing obstacles to addressing or acting upon those risks and opportunities.

I had played the game a few times and I tried a number of strategies to ensure success. However, I found that the game, like life, is somewhat unpredictable. I did find increased success with more development, research and more community connections. The game also highlighted the obstacles facing risk management. For example, time pressure made it more difficult to choose and undertake activities. 

If I had to change on thing in the game to better capture one thing that captures risk management where I live, I would add a component to differentiate according to class and gender. Where I live, poor people and women are significantly worse affected by risk shocks than rich people and they take longer to recover. The game could demonstrate this by, for example, showing some pods being worse affected than others and taking a longer period to rebuild. Pods could also be different colours to show different genders.</div>
