    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. My largest trade off early on was not over protecting my investment. Spending money on insurance never actually gave me a return, it only mitigated damages, therefore it was very important to invest in my society, which in tern gave me more money to keep building.<br /><br />2. I learned not to overprotect my my society, which was my only investment to pay dividends. I spent just enough on insurance to mitigate the costs of small amounts of damage, and spend most of my cash on building up my society which returned more money for building.<br /><br />3. I would add different kinds of pods with different levels of protection, cost, and production.Â </div>
