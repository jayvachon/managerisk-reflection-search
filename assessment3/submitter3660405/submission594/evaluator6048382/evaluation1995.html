    <div class="field-value">My classmate did very well. He/she was able to improve the means to be used to deal with the comets by combining the research to get detailed information, protection, insurance, and so forth and the performance was increasing and at the same time the game was much understood. My fellow mentioned that a prior and well done preparation is rewarding strategy though it takes resources and time. Furthermore, my classmate mentioned that limited resources might impair preparation and coping with the aftermath of a disaster and in our case they are damages caused by comets. Once again, my classmate emphasizes the use of preventive measures (preparation) and added that where she/he lives there is a need of resources and suggested easy access to small loans with low interest rates. I appreciate very much this reflection and I learn a lot from it. Great job!</div>
