    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of Risk Management in this game is to build a Framework which will permit the community of Alora to pursue its development and at the same time try to contain the risks from the fallings of comets.</p><p>The choices I made was to build pods on the places where it is possible or where the research works on the ground permit.</p><p>During the game I confronted some trade-offs .It was specially between informatiions from the movements of comets and the protection in place during the phase of construction.When the risks from the coming comets are hight and the protection in place are unsufficient , I suspend the building process and try to increase the level of protection in order to reach or go beyonddepass the level of comets threats. When I got the correct level of protection , I start again the building operations.</p><p>The preparation of risk affect development immediately and in a long term if the process is well managed. You see the outcome increase when you maintain your efforts constant and this can be visible and sensitive. On the contrary if the preparation of risk management is not well planned you lost many times in redoing the works over a long period of times and this affect development on short and long term.</p><p>If I have to play the game just one time , while building the pods I will watch closely the movements of comets. As soon as I notice that the level of risk from the comets are higher than the protection system in place , I will stop the building process and raise consequently le protection level.</p><p>If I have to play the game many times , when I gain the first round , I will try to consolidate the result by applying the same principles I used before and also some insights I got before in terms of level of destruction and the adjustments to make on the assurance fees.</p><p>The mains things I learned from this game are :</p><ul><li>The general framework of Risk Management;</li><li>the impact of a good risk management on the research;</li><li>Risk Management is not an linear process but an iterative process.</li></ul><p>If I am tasked to develop a new version of game for the risk management of my country I will choice amongst many others risks ,<strong> the financial risk. </strong></p><p>I will change the comets movements by the movement of international financial system, this will represent the <strong>external factors of risks</strong>.</p><p>I will assimilate the pod building by the running of business on the national territory by: households,enterprises, community.</p><p>I will assimilate time to the fiscal year </p><p>I will replace the measurement tool on the left by measurement tool of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p><p>The insurance system will be the international insurance system.</p><p>The bar of protection on the right will represent the work  of administration to create a good environment for doing business.</p><p>The research entity will consist of the community of various consultants who work for promoting business in the country.</p><p>I will add an<strong> internal factor of risks </strong>, I will represent this by the movements of phenomen such as corruption , injustice ,unployment.These phenomenes will move in the country at the same time as the movement of international financial system. </p><p><br /></p></div>
