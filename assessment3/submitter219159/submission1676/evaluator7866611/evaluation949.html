    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection would be the criticism of the game and how it did not necessarily help in understanding risk management on a whole. 

What would make this reflection better would be more comprehensive answers for the questions posted above.  I found the answers, while comprehensive and showed an understanding of the game, weren't answered fully and there was more to be desired.</div>
