    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">          Having played the Risk Horizon game a number of times, I have come to equate <b><i>Risk Management</i></b> with<b><i> Resource Management amidst threats of Shock damages</i></b>. In the game, there are 2 major limited resources--Time and Money. <b><i>Time</i></b>: I had to manage the community until the horizon (marked on the left side gauge) is reached within the time limit set for each level. <b><i>Money</i></b><i>: </i>I had to grow and spend wisely between 3 projects, namely<i>: </i><i><b>Development</b> </i>(building and upgrading pods), <i><b>Protection</b> </i>(raising the platform to build and increase community resilience against the severity of <i>Shocks</i>), and<i> <b>Insurance</b></i> (reducing the cost of repairs and recovering the lost <i>Time</i> when <i>Shocks</i> do hit). <br />          <br />          At the onset, I wanted to create a beautiful community <i>immediately</i>. I focused <i>Money</i> on <b><i>Development </i></b>by building and upgrading a lot of pods while buying the highest offered <b><i>Insurance</i></b>.  I thought that approach would be enough to win the game. It wasn't. With low <i>Money</i> supply, I clicked on incoming comets (<i>Shocks</i>) to gain <b><i>Research (Knowledge)</i></b> which I noticed lowered the severity of the damages. Despite that, the community <i>still </i>often sustained medium to severe levels of damages. And although the <b><i>Insurance </i></b>lowered repair costs and returned lost<i> Time</i>, the <i>Money</i> which I waited for while it replenished and regrew mostly went into <b><i>Recovery </i></b>(repair costs). I hardly advanced a level and only survived a short while during the next.<br /><br />          Learning from the experience, I adjusted my approach and game strategy by taking note that <b><i>Time, Money, and Shocks</i></b> together makes an <i></i>inseparable and inevitable package in the game. I <i>still </i>bought <b><i>Insurance </i></b>and <i>still </i>did <b><i>Research (Knowledge)</i></b>. What changed? I <i>paced<b> </b></i><b><i>Development </i></b>by only building a few pods at a time and upgrading 1 or 2 at a level. I also started to put <i>Money </i>into <b><i>Protection </i></b>by raising the level of the community's resilience to the severity of the comets' (<i>Shocks</i>') damages. I also learned that clicking and connecting the pods during a <i>Shock </i>lowers (and at times, zeroes-out) damages at no <i>Money</i> or <i>Time</i> costs. This is tantamount to building and sharing calamity survival support networks within the community. This is an interesting part of the game which I had not known earlier. This new approach, which is mostly a <i>Money</i> trade-off between <i><b>Development </b></i>and <b><i>Protection </i></b>compared to the old approach, eased advancing a level and lengthened game survival closer to the marked horizon in the next.<br /><br />        The takeaways from playing the Risk Horizon game are learning <i>to temper</i> <b><i>Development </i></b>with<i> proper</i> <b><i>Risk Management</i></b> and that <i>conscientiousness </i>and <i>patience </i>are indispensable virtues to establishing a beautiful, progressive, and sustainable community.<br /><br />---<br /><br />        The <b><i>Risk Horizon</i></b> game simulates situations for learning and gaining appreciation of the advantages of Risk Management. Within its safe in-game environment, the player can experiment with different approaches to managing risks through dealing with Shocks<i>-</i>-<b><i>negative shocks</i></b> in particular.<i> I suggest putting an in-game element representing </i><b><i>positive shocks</i></b>.<br /><br />        I live in the Philippines--a <b><i>negative shocks</i></b> stricken country with a <i>risk averse culture</i>. Everyone here has been made aware of <b><i>negative shocks</i></b> more from actual experiences than from theoretical discussions. Along with learning how to prepare and manage risks from <b><i>negative shocks</i></b>, <i>gaining useful skills of identifying and leveraging good opportunities from</i> <b><i>positive shocks</i></b> will aid in making well-informed and risk-calculated decisions whether in good times or in those not so good ones.<br /></div>
