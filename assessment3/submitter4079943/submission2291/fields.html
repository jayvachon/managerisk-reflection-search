    <h1>Submission 2291 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4079943, session_user_id: db64642cb29b2970ef13728ab6b3fc65829f2c0b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game you had to balance increasing the development with the costs (insurance, protection) to protect the development. Preparation for risk immediately stymied development and those funds were used for insurance or protection instead of building, repairing or upgrading. However after some time, preparation for risk put you in a better position as it costed much less to repair if disaster struck and your progress improved at a faster rate.
After playing the game the first time, what I did differently was to repair the developments as soon as possible and to effectively weigh if insurance or protection should be taken.
The main things I learnt from the game was to manage risks properly to achieve your goals. Challenges (comets) may come and are sometimes inevitable but there are actions you can take to mitigate the damages such as taking out insurance and protecting yourself. With proper research and knowledge you would be in a better position to know the best action(s) to take.  However you have to weigh the costs and benefits of mitigating the damages as it may not be worth it to protect  yourself and take out insurance when weighing the chances of the disaster occurring and the level of impact. 
The change I would make is to make the game more realistic or applicable to players. Instead of comets, I would have floods, earthquake, drought or fires as the disaster.</div>
