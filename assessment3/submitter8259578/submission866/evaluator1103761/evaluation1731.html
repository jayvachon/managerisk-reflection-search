    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that my classmate used the main concepts about risk management to explain how was the experience of the game for him or her. Also, she or he was not talking only about the game, but about the reality that it represents. The suggestion made to improve the game is understandable, because it is about diversifying the options for resources, risk and obstacles types. For me, this game reflection is coherent and try to encompass the main ideas about the risk management, reflected in the game. If I could add something in the reflection would be the obstacle of working alone, because it is complicated to manage big risk alone, without the advice of qualified people or specialized institutions.</div>
