    <h1>Submission 2433 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2844103, session_user_id: 6ad86645b7d610db93a82245468b3a15a46120b0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.</p><p>The role of risk management in this game is to protect the
place throughout by implementing strong and effective means and controls.</p>

<p>It is very much essential to research and analyze the severity
of the disaster, and plan for the protection considering the budget for the specific cause.  </p>

<p>If we prepare and act for a cause today, it will protect in
future. </p><p><br /></p>

<p>2.</p>

<p>The first few games played are true learning.  The first time, I took 75% insurance and some
protection and research, it didn’t help in coming out from the disaster, after
that took 25% insurance and protection with 35% of research made me cross level
1.  </p><p>Knowledge  and research plays a vital part,  insurance will cover up big losses and  upgrading the technology will help us protect
to come out from the disaster soon.</p></div>
