    <div class="field-value">A good all round attempt to answer the question asked which resulted a well presented submission. The key strength was able to demonstrate and distinguish the role of knowledge, protection and insurance. One thing that would make the submission better would be to show evidence and analysis from his own perspective on the game rather than mostly describing what happened in the game. </div>
