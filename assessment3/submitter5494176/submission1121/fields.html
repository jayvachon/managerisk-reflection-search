    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1) Risk management was required to overcome the threat of comets. The choices to be made were as below:</div><div>Under Knowledge: Whether to take time and study chances and severity of a comet strike</div><div>Under Protection: Whether to increase the height of land</div><div>Under Insurance: Whether to buy insurance cover for the pods</div><div><br /></div><div>But these choices affected develpoment since increasing land height, buying insurance and studying comets either required time away from productive pod development or meant spending limited money or both.</div><div><br /></div><div>2) I played the game more than once and learned that land height was a key parameter to avoid loss. Thus, I started increasing land height from the start. What I learnt was that there is no 1 particular solution to the risk. I needed to combine all the below measures to reach my goal - taking insurance cover, increasing land height, studying comets and making more pods.</div><div><br /></div><div>3) I'd probably bring in the concept of Government laws such as laws that bar increasing land height beyond a certain level or making insurance mandatory or the Government providing help post a comet hit</div></div>
