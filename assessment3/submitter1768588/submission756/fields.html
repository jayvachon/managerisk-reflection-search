    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b><i></i></b></p><pre><b><i><code></code></i></b></pre><b><i>Role of Risk Management</i></b><p>- Intend optimize allocation and use of our limited resources (knowledge, protection and insurance) as means to impulse a time - sustained development for this reign within a <b>uncertainty </b>context. </p><p>- It´s a decision game. Always you must make a decision, an option and seek a rational equilibrium between different composite of resources after an informal <b>cost - benefit analysis</b>. </p><p><b><i>Learning from the game</i></b></p><p>At the beginning, I relied on my capabilities and knowledge but failed. After several attempts, my knowledge grew, but if you don´t make use of it, then return again to level 1. Then I began to study intensely the comets, its data (severity of impact, likelihood of impact) and the impact to insurance cost. Additionally, I taught  to manage scarce money and try assign it rationally between buying insurance policy and/or getting up the protection.  </p><p><b>Time and money resources and its management represent a key issue.</b> Meanwhile time going on, I must thinking not under a inmediate shock but<b> future perspective</b>. We need doing some kind of investment (protection, etc). No matter the first comet. Whichever next are important, too. I observed that the first levels (1,2 and 3 indeed), factor protection is necessary and less insurance. If we´ll get advanced up game, the relative position compared protection is more reasonable. Without forgetting, the more knowledge, less insurance is necessary. As insurance as protection, both are not cheap. Up level, cost gets up. </p><p>In theory, the more research, more relations and links with other communities. So, it´s useful when you need to repair your houses. But, if you overdo in any resource, just then, the meter gets into red and the development is getting down again. <strong>Resilience down??  </strong></p><p>If anyone promote the development in a quickly mood or style, failure will come, because it needs to be more assured and if your insurance coverage is limited, again bad situation. We don´t know the next shot, its potential danger. So, we are to protect us. But if you protect too much for tiny potential damage, money will fall down for constructing more development. </p><p>It´s key to discover the<b> balance between resources</b>. From level 3 or 4 to take more consideration to insurance resource, I think it´s important because we must support, defend what we´ve already got it. Of course it´s unthinkable if we haven´t handle appropiately protection and knowledge before.</p><p>So, one fact I also taught was to upgrade the community, securing it but gradually, stepping. If the research is fruitful, then severity downgrade. This matter helps us to waste too much money in protection adequating it. </p><p>So I arrived until level 5, but never didn´t overpass it. Perhaps, I didn´t know how re-balance my resources structure, specially the role of money stock and to <b>re-gain more time, achieve a good resilience position.</b></p><p>Many times, we ourselves let us falling into self -confidence and the past may be not repeated again in the future. New level, distinct comets and its hit specifications. Bad cost - benefit analysis very likely and wrong decisión. In spite of rolling in money, I suppose if it is not employed wisefully, meter paints in red. <b>Perseverance and Coping</b></p><p><b><i>Changes </i></b></p><p>A potential improvement will be introduce estimated loss in each comet or potential shock, linking impact to cost. So, you can manage even better your assignment of resources.</p><p>Other change will be to clarify a bit more the roIe of money and how you see the Coping.</p><p><i>Having in level 5 1000 $, good insurance coverage and respetable level of protection with a good community development, no useful to overpass it.</i><br /></p><p><br /></p></div>
