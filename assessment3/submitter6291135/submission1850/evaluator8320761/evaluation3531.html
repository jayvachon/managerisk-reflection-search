    <div class="field-value">The reflection was written clearly with some attempt made to reflection upon the learnings of the course.  The reflection would have been better had the author gone into more detail to more strongly correlate the game with the key learnings of this course.  This could have been acheived had the author written a longer (only approx. 200 words long) account, meeting the word limit.</div>
