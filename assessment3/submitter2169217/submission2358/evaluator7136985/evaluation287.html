    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection lies in the final point, i.e., the suggestion for a long term insurance policy. I agree with your view that this is a more realistic approach than purchasing new insurance schemes in short intervals of time.

One thing that, I feel, would make the reflection better is a reflection on the constraints (time, limited budget, accountability in the form of failure to meet growth targets, etc.) and a co-relation with real life instances.</div>
