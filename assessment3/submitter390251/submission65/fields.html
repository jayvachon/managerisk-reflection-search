    <h1>Submission 65 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 390251, session_user_id: c163e623c10c3b909347b5bac88a4b1df7f8c4a4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. deploying infrastructure, following the trace of the comets, protecting such an infrastructure by buying insurance as well as lifting up the plâteu on where the city is landed.  I had to buy insurance and most of the time i was underinsured or overinsured, then researching and following comets as they crashed in the deep ocean, in the meantime, upgrading pods and lifting up plain field or fixing up shattered pods....Money was never enough.....tracking, tracing comets and buying insurance as well as the height of the city were crucial .......they ate up funds devoted to improve pods......Sadly, the game doesn't allow you to develop a bullet proof landscape or at least a blitz proof landscape, so, the crashing comets will have little to no impact against facilities and infrastructure of our city. <br /><br />2.you must try to build up and to improve all of your pods every level, you can not leave blanks or broken pods, you must buy some kind of insurance, the protection bar level must increase at least one bar per level, you must follow the comets all at once (boring and time consuming task)....By following comets the severity of a crash is lessened but not vanished....The first time I played riskhorizon.org, I was ultradefensive, by buying insurance and lifting up the soils well above sea level and waiting until the very last seconds to build up pods....This did not work...Underdevelopment or no development at all is punished by the game.<br /><br />Main things I learned from this head bashing game:  there is no chance to play the game unscathed, havoc and obliteration will hit you at some degree and money is NEVER enough to provide 100% coverage of the accrued damage...The pods are isolated and they seem to be reluctant to create a community/cooperative or a network of fearless rescuers <br /><br />3. buying insurance seems to be useless, after a havoc, there is no mention about you are cashing the ransom or the pods are rebuilt by the insurance corporation, lifting up the height of the city ask you to go berserk with your mouse keys, it takes a lot of clicks.  There is no real chance to create an emergency community, a seek and destroy cooperative  or a rescue party of volunteers.<br /><br />Conclusion:  if the idea was to stress us beyond sanity as it might happen in a real case scenario, the game is 10/10....If the idea was about deploying a gay (Nietzsche: gay science) educational tool, a top notch software .....1/10???<br /><br />I wrote this review before all of the glitches surrounding the original game were solved as the world bank bedlamites swore to do so...... <br /><br />this game can drive the average college-goer, schooler or university rookie: B A N A N A S !!!!<br /></div>
