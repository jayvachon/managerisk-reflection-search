    <div class="field-value">This reflection demonstrated great though processes. I really liked the answer for the first question. The response demonstrated that the author understood the game and how it applies to reality. To improve this reflection however, I would love to see points 2, and especially 3, expanded upon. I think point 3 would have been excellent if more information had been given. </div>
