    <h1>Submission 2567 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7980468, session_user_id: 625bdaa970fe8aa3dcd35387dc1323bd20b26d11)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The role of risk management in the game was to better understanding on how can we build the resilience of the community from the shocks faced and how to better prepare for the future shocks. It's a very simple game for anyone who is interested in understanding what risk management is and why is it important. The biggest challenge which gradually increases in the game is to understand the comets and it's effects. Many times the information available about the comet says that the comet is dangerous and will effect the community &amp; to your surprise it either misses or have a minimal effect and is vice versa when you see the comet won't effect but leaves with a damage. Insurance plays a very big role in this unsuitability and having the best insurance always helps. The game teaches you that no matter how strong or cleaver you are, you cannot predict the future and it's always smart in being prepared. Increasing the protection level is a time consuming process and hamper a lot in development of the community, because no matter how many pods or upgrades you have when you are hit by a comet recovery does take time.<br />If your meter level is above the asked mark the level increases even if you consume expenditure to increase protection, but that does not happen if you level is below the mark.<br />2) Did try different ways, but the successful once where the one in which you have limited resource which can be upgraded and  best insurance &amp; then gradually go with development of new pods.<br />3) I would like to add one option which helps in communicating with the player on how effective is the way of playing at present, as no one wants to know about the effect after it occurred. As there is always an issue with water clogging during rainy season in most parts of INDIA.<br /> <br /></div>
