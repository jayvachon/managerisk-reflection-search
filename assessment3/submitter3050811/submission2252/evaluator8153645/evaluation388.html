    <div class="field-value">The reflections discusses some aspects of risk management game. The key strength of this reflection lies on the concern about the allocation of cash to balance between development and risk preparation. The author mentioned the challenge of choosing the appropriate amount of insurance when moving to the next round. This challenge surely does affect the rate of development and the effectiveness of risk preparation.
There are some suggestions that might make this reflection better. The author should be clearer about his or her strategy to get to round 4; how changing risk management tactics affect the development. For example: the cost of insurance increases each round so the player may consider lifting the ground to reduce the damage caused by the comets. The author mentioned the appropriate cost of insurance but he or she did not give a specific number; which option is the best as the game processes? The response lacks two risk preparation options which are the observation of comets and lifting the ground. They are important if the player wants to reduce the damage and protect the community. The author can discuss more about the other two options to make a well-rounded response. </div>
