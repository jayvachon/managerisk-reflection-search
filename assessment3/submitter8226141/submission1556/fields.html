    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk
Horizon game brought me a lot of pleasure. It was a quite difficult game, I
have to play it twice to reach fourth level. The most important thing in the
game was to balance money spending between development (building or upgrading
buildings) and securing (terrain lifting and insurance).</p>

<p>Risk
management is very important in the game. Without proper precautions you could
lost all your buildings – cost of repairs could be so high, you wouldn’t get to
the goal before time. The best way to win in my opinion was to avoid danger
(lift terrain so high, that the comet wouldn’t cause damage). But from the
other hand concentrating too much on avoiding danger resulted in poor
development and lack of resources – that was the reason why I had to start a
game for second time. But results of mistakes made in early levels was visible
long time after – it was hard to value if decisions I’ve made was right or not.</p>

<p>In the
second run I concentrated more on development, and secure only slight above the
minimum level that was required. I also did not put so much money into
insurance – damage caused by comet was so severe, it did not allow to continue
game on further levels (due to time of fixing) – so it was no sense to spend
money on it. The main thing I learned is the right balance in money spending.</p>

<p>I would
shorten time of building fixes – on higher levels you are not able to win after
being hit, even when you have the highest insurance, due to this time. In real
life you can split production and not keep all resources in one place – it
might increase the cost of business, but allow you to continue production even
in occurrence of disaster – you lose only part of your power. This game
unfortunately lacks in this – when you are hit all buildings are damaged. If I
worked with developers I would introduce sort of production splitting. This
game is a simple model, but I think is a bit to simple – in real life you have
to face many treats, with different impact factors and probabilities. In game
you have only one threat (but with different factors and probabilities) and
also one way to protect. This model Is to simple, and I thing in further levels
other kind of danger and protection should occur.</p>

<p><span>In general
game is very good – it shows in simple way practical issues connected with risk
management, and proves that the best way to learn is to play.<a></a></span></p>
