    <div class="field-value">The key strength is to reveal risks can be minimized by knowledge, protection and insurance. However, it seems that the description about insurance was not his/her own experience but his/her knowledge. I'd like for the writer to tell more detail about that how he/she felt or got to know its goodness because I didn't feel the insurance in the game was not so effective. That means, I wished to compare his/her experience with mine. Except that, I like this essay cause it mentioned good example e.g. how we can measure Jakarta's repeated floods and how prevent river floods. This guy looks quite good knowledge how to deal with natural disaster. I agree the suggestion just by not throwing garbage into gutters and by dredging the river. Those are good and simple way to prevent floods.</div>
