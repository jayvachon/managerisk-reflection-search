    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game Risk Horizon Game one's get a good reflection about risks and its consequences which pose a formidable threat to poverty reduction efforts. This game try caa plethora of community-based risk management arrangements across the developing world. These types of arrangements are garnering greater interest in light of the growing recognition of the relative prominence of household- or individual-specific idiosyncratic risk as well as the increasing shift towards community-based development funding. The game ask some reflection about potential advantages (such as targeting, cost and informational) and disadvantages (such as exclusion and inability to manage correlated risk) of these arrangements, and their implications for the design of innovative social fund programs.<br />Also,there is growing recognition that vulnerability to risk is one of the defining some characteristics. Such differentiated dynamics of household wellbeing accentuate the importance of effective risk management to reduce and respond to risks. However, no one-size-fits-all risk management tool exists. The appropriateness of interventions depends on the nature of the risk involved. Shocks are either idiosyncratic - meaning one household’s experience is typically unrelated to neighboring households’ - or covariate - meaning that many households in the same locality suffer similar shocks.Given the prevalence of shocks, rural communities have commonly developed norms and institutions that attempt to reduce risk. Community-based strategies can be adopted ex ante (before the realization of a risk) and include risk reduction or mitigation. They can also be adopted ex post (after the realization of a risk) and include risk coping measures. In this context, the distinction between covariate and idiosyncratic shocks is important as community-based arrangements and strategies can, in principle, help households cope with idiosyncratic shocks but less so with covariate shocks, unless communities find a way to transfer risk outside the community or to others within the community who are willing and able to assume more risk. Notwithstanding the type of risk, a number of studies have shown that significant gaps exist in these risk-sharing arrangements, implying that there is a need for outside intervention.<br />Poor populations face considerable uninsured risk. Especially when there is reason to believe that poverty traps may exist and compound the threat posed by adverse shocks, there is considerable return to reducing risk exposure through improved ex ante risk management and providing improved coping strategies through insurance and insurance-like arrangements. Communities throughout the globe commonly take these tasks upon themselves, banding together to reduce risk exposure and to provide informal mutual insurance within the group. This is important to recognize and such behaviors merit reinforcement. Relative to market-based arrangements, community-based arrangements have important informational advantages. Since rural communities typically have intimate knowledge regarding the circumstances and needs of member households, they are better able to identify the most needy and vulnerable among them, thereby improving targeting outcomes. In addition, due to their close physical proximity and frequent, repeated interactions between them, they can use relatively low-cost methods of contract enforcement, such as peer monitoring and the threat of social sanctions. These advantages enable the viable delivery of financial services, such as microinsurance, microcredit and microsavings, at prices that are accessible to poor households, which is often not the case for a typical commercial provider. However, gaps systematically appear in social safety nets as the endogenous nature of group formation commonly leads to the exclusion of some more marginalized subpopulations. <br /><br /><br /></div>
