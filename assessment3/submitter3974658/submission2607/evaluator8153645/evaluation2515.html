    <div class="field-value">The reflection surely describe how risk preparation should be made based on the nature of the risk. However, it is not relevant the risk management aspect of Horizon game which is the topic. The essay requires player to present how they employed risk management tactics such as lifting the ground, observing the comets, and purchasing insurance to protect the settlement against terrestrial strikes. Additional requirement is the recommendation for the game which was not mentioned in the essay. The author also did not present how he or she would do if the game were played again. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to evaluate the essay. </div>
