    <div class="field-value">Overall, I very much enjoyed reading this game reflection. The part I liked most was the writer's idea to make the game even more realistic. I totally agree with the writer that in real life risk management, there is no such thing as one omnipotent "luminator" who does literally everything. Indeed it should be a team work, a joined up endeavor from various entities at varying levels. I bet in real life, there will be lots of coordination failures in execution as well. On the other hand, I found the game reflection to be a little too concise, too general from time to time. I think it is manly due to the writer's first language is not English. It could have been slight better if the one talked about some other aspects in the game. Link between preparation and coping is a good example. One may think one either prepare or cope with risk but the game showed that good preparation almost always lead to good coping. Also good preparation almost always lead to minimal burden and time required for swift recovery. One could have talked more about different components in risk management depicted in the game: "Protection" illustrated as act of lifting the island. "Insurance" to complement relatively slow "Protection" building. Pros and cons of different options as well as constantly changing property of risk together make the job of risk management challenging, I think. Overall, still job well done and keep up the good work!</div>
