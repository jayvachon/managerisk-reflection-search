Risk
management is the key element of this game. This game helped me to learn more
about risk management and showed how to face challenges by forecasting risk,
risk management is important for a society. Insurance, research about future
risks, time and money management are the main factors for winning this game. Being
the<span> luminator of Alora, my
task ofÂ developing this community</span>
by meeting certain milestones in the ways was really hard but it was thought
provoking and fun.

<p>Managing
and utilising cash was the first task for me after that I insured building
based on future risks that can happen, forecasting the future risk was also a
challenging job for me. By doing regular research about comets falls we can
forecasting the future and reduce the future damages.</p>

<p>Alora
falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause
waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between
growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.</p>

<p>The
power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the
time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the
different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By
doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of
time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.</p>

<p>By undertaking
insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the
chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the
damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to
consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to
be put into best possible usage.</p>

<p>Playing
the game for the first time was difficult for me but after learned to manage
the risk, game was fun for me. Managing the available cash and forecasting the
future risk helps to develop and retain pods of Alora.</p>

<p>Main
things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different
risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about
different ways to manage risk etc.</p>

<p>If given a chance to develop a new version of game we could
probably include the role of self-help groups within the community who could
probably pool adequate money and help each members with the group financially
in times of need. They could also take up a group insurance policy to
anticipate and manage their risk. They could discuss within the groups their
past experiences of risk and share within their group</p>
