    <h1>Submission 1595 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8288691, session_user_id: 1d1cdd159fddff2b92a202195827b38d88b0772f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management of this game is the choice of the money you should put into. you should make balance among the knowledge of comet, build your pods, protection and insurance. In the beginning stage, you should pay attention to learning about the predicting of disaster caused by comet, and raise your ability to protect your home. In regarding about the consequence of the decision you make at the first stage, your should invest your money in a balancing way. For example, If you put most of  your money and energy in the protection, and at the end you will not have money, and you home will be damaged by the striking of comets.  <br /><br />At the first round, I just concerning about the protection, using all my money into the raising the level of protection. In the end, I just have two pods,  so my resources are so poor, and I lost the game. Afterwards, I will put the moneys into the knowledge, pods, insurance and protection equably. First, I put the building of pods at the priority position, the resource is the key for the development. At the beginning, I will make sure have enough money to building up all the pods,  and use the spare money on the upgrading of the pods. Second, I you keep eyes on the comet, learning about severity of it and the chance of it hitting on my home, then I will raising my ability of protection, and protecting my home from the hitting. Third, I  purchasing the lowest level of insurance, and protecting my home from the destruction which caused by external accidents.<br /><br />During the proceeding of the game, I learning that one's ability can only coming from you internal strengths. In the program of risk and management, the poor and misery people is the key person to change their own destiny. when they are motivated by their own wishes and dreams, they will find their own ways to fight against terrible situations. Such as, access to the employment  training,  seeking the help from outside world and pay attention to learning more information about how to avoiding the unwanted loss. <br /><br />In addition, the balance is another key factor for sustainable development. building pods, researching of comets, protections and insurance are all the aspects you should pay attention to care about. Just like that, the rise management also should make the choice and keep the balance in mind. the external environment, the current situation of poor, the governments' ability and willingness, the practical methods, and the cost and earnings. The poor is should not be taken as the isolate problems, he was connected with his family, community, country and even the whole world. When we want to make them get rid of the awkward situation, the environment around him should not be ignore. <br /><br />As the  game teaches me, you didn't have to build the strongest  protection power for the threatening which does  not exist. when we dealing with the risk in our daily life, we should just focus our energy on the most basic needs and the things that concerning about future development, and ignore our fear about the hostility of our peers, 
social injustice and unrealistic hardships.<br /><br />For the new version game,  I prefer the insurance will <span>play </span>greater roles. As the key factors for the sustainable development, insurance in this game is  ignored. Currently, I can play the game well if I can take care of  pods and protection. However, Insurance is the useful tool for us to avoid the  large damage cause by disasters in our daily life, and make it possible for the poor to take bold decision to adopt the new  technology and methods to pursue 
higher profits. <br /><br /> </div>
