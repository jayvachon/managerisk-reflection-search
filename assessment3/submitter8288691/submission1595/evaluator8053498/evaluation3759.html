    <div class="field-value">I am a native English speaker and I enjoyed your reflection. thank you for taking risk management and applying it's theory to the world.
To make the reflection better focus on putting capital letters at the beginning of sentences, review work for spelling mistakes and grammar issues. Overall, I am able to understand your writing and I scored you perfectly, I am excellent at English and anyone who takes marks off shouldn't because English is a challenging language and despite grammar issues your arguments and thoughts were well-thought. Good Luck </div>
