    <div class="field-value">The student describes well the game and has creative ideas about how to improve the game to make it more realistic.
The thing that could have been done better is to balance the space to answer all the research questions: for instance, the student provided a detailed description of the strategies used during the game and ways to improve the game, while the different trade-offs between knowledge, protection, and insurance are not adequately explained.</div>
