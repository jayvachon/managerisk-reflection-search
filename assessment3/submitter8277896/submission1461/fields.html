    <h1>Submission 1461 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8277896, session_user_id: 62669585e69a085c5d19eed7f0acc15463220ac2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. In the game, I was all the time facing a trade-off between spending resources (even game money or time) on development and risk management. Meeting development requirement was a condition for advancing in the game, so there was an continuous effort for developing. At the same time, failing to adequately manage risks will definitely lead to a setback in the development.</p>
<p>There are some conclusions:</p>
<p>- You have to know your risks. When a new factor of risk (in our case, comet) appears, you have to spend some time analyzing it. If your protection capacity at the moment are enough for preventing damages, you can concentrate further on development. If not, you have to increase protection, get an insurance and prepare for copping with the consequences (continue researching the risks).</p>
<p>- Protection agains risks is the key factor. Your have to be prepared, even if building protection will slow down for a while your development. If the level of protection is adequate to the risk level, it will simply negate all the effects of the risk factor. Protection degrades in time, so you have to regularly rebuild it and verify if it is enough.</p>
<p>- Insurance is a must have in the cases when protection is not enough to face the disaster magnitude. In the cases when protection is enough, and you are in lack of resources (most common cases in real life), insurance can be skipped.</p>
<p>- In the case of disasters, you have to be prepared to cope with the consequences. This need a good knowledge of the outcomes of the disaster (research, in the case of game). Also, game show us the importance of fact and adequate reaction.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Even in the short terms you have to redirect some resources from developing to the preparation for risk, in the long term losses avoided by a good risk management are higher.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>2. Initially I was trying to buy insurance at each level, as soon as I can. In the later games, I have started to buy insurance only when appears some risks that I was unable to prevent at that moment. From the game, I learned the following: You have to be prepared, to know your risks; Is better to prevent a risk, if it is possible, than to cope with it consequences; You have to get insurance for the risk that you can’t prevent; and you must be prepared to cope with the outcomes.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>3. In the game, all the risks can be, theoretically, be covered by protection (highest level of protection cover highest damage). In the real life, there can be some risks that can’t be covered. So, in the game can be introduced some (rare) comets with the level of damage higher than maximal level of protection. This will increase importance of insurance and research in the game, and will make it more realistic.</p></div>
