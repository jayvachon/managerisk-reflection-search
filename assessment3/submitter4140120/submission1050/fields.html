    <h1>Submission 1050 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4140120, session_user_id: 2cc5b0fe38becd96161957c815567cb83decc542)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is quite revealing what risk management could achieve
when adopted in every aspects of life. In this game, risk management played a
major role in the constant development of the community. Whenever a risk
management choice was made, impacts of risk outcome seem to be low or avoided or transferred. In the
levels I played, often time when I study (by using the research feature) the
characteristics of the falling meteors, it automatically informs me of nature
of that incoming meteors, allowing me to make a decision of what to do either
to buy insurance or to upgrade the structures or to lift the land area. When any
of these choices were made, I noticed that development (the tube indicator)
became more rapid or steady as it where.</p>

<p> On playing the game a second time, I had to make use of my
research feature more often in order to learn about the meteors, and make adequate
decision on the next course of action. This feature helped me to know when to upgrade the quality if the structures, and know when insurance would be necessary. Overall, risk management practice cannot
be over emphasized when it comes to development and preparing for the unknown. Being prepared for the outcome of risk is practically the only way to survive the shock of the outcome. This is evident in the game, as many choices make directly affected the development rate of the community.</p>

<p> I would like a feature that would enable players of the game
actually select to acquire the services of experts in the area where risk is
being accessed. Often times we are faced with something we know little or nothing about. In this case the services of expert would be required for expert opinion and planning, thereby improving the quality of risk management outcome.</p></div>
