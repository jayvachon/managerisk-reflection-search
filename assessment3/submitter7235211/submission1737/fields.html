    <h1>Submission 1737 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7235211, session_user_id: 883495c598f528d6eac2e8d20ae7cef34e32fd01)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game, I had to develop my community - by ensuring that I was building the pods, developing them and managing the risks of a comet hitting the pods. Effective risk management by research, protection and insurance helped me ensure that the damage to the community from a comet-hit and the costs associated with redevelopment were minimized. Connection between pods is also an important factor in minimizing the risks from a comet-hit -- as this helps to ensure sharing of resources between the pods to help minimize damage and speed up the recovery process. <br />While building the community, I had to ensure that I was allocating money wisely to build and develop the pods in an efficient manner - I chose to build 3 pods first, then develop each of them to a Level 2 pod, and then adding 2 or 3 more news pods, then upgrading them to higher levels. I ensured that I was not building more than 2-3 new pods at a time, because then I would have to compromise on the development of the existing pods. This is an important issue in risk management because having a number of pods that are not upgraded to higher levels would mean higher damage to these pods in the event of a comet-hit. So, a balance between building a pod and developing existing pods had to be made. <br />In managing risk for the comet-hit, I realized that time and resources have to be spent effectively between research to gain knowledge about the comet (chance of hit and severity), preparing for the comet-hit and also buying insurance in the event of repair after a comet-hit. Research seemed to be a very low-cost item, but one with high implications because it does not make sense to waste resources on preparing the pods for a comet-hit if the chance of a hit is very low. That money could instead be used for developing the pods. In the event that the chance of a hit is high, I would then choose to prepare for the risk depending on the severity of the comet. Again, research is very important because in the case of a comet hit, the severity and chance of hit keep changing as the comet comes closer to the pods - the longer we observe, the more accurate we are in our estimates of how much protection and insurance are needed as part of the risk management for the event. <br />Preparation for risk affected development - in cases of very low severity and chance of hit, I chose to develop my pods instead of preparing for the risk because I felt that pod development would cover any small risk of the comet hitting and causing damage. If the chance of hit was high, I would start preparation for the hit , which would mean compromising on development or building of new pods. Severity of the comet hit also helped me buy my insurance - I usually bought a lower priced insurance scheme if the severity of hit was low but chance of hit was high, and a higher priced insurance if both severity and chance of hit were high. However, I made sure that I kept going back periodically to monitor the comet - ie research - especially in the moments right before the comet hit. <br />I played the game twice - in the second chance, I spent more time on research and development of the pods that just on preparing for the risk and spending too much money on insurance. <br />The single change that I would make to the game is to add a component on education of the people in the community. While research and preparation may cover aspects of educating the community, I feel that in the place where I live (India) a number of risks can be better managed simply by spreading awareness. </div>
