    <h1>Submission 2348 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6963227, session_user_id: 8284cc23c2e53ec12146299fcdc3a8b70883b67b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Question 1: <br />In order to succeed in this game, you would require to reach a good balance of <strong>knowledge</strong> (research of the comets), <strong>protection </strong>(raising the community),<strong> insurance </strong>(purchasing it based on risk of collision). It is difficult to do well in the game, as choosing one decision will sacrifice another aspect. <br /><br />Choices I had to make include;<br />1) Spending limited money to purchase insurance, the trade-off being not able to use that sum to<br />purchase upgrades, and raising the community. <br />2) Spending the time researching the comets, the trade-off being the time I have used it to raise the community <br />3) Choosing the number of pods I would like to build,  the trade-off being the height and grade I would sacrifice if I<br />chose to build many pods.  <br /><br />If I know the risk of collision is low; <br />1) I would not purchase insurance, and use that sum to make more pods. <br />2) I would use the time to raise the community <br />3) I would build the maximum number of pods <br /><br />The converse would be true where risk of collision is high. <br /><br />Question 2: <br />To succeed at the game, you'll need to play it multiple times to understand what needs to be done in maximising the opportunity. <br />The tips and hints given after each game is helpful in understanding the rules of the game. From the game I learnt that experience is important in order to get better at the game, by playing the game multiple times I am able to understand the dynamics and the trade-offs and decisions that needed to be made. <br /><br />Question 3: <br />It would be useful to know the hidden rules of the game, for example does more knowledge result in a lower risk of collision, how does raising the community affect the impact of a collision? These tips only came out after the end of a game, it would be interesting to see how my decision making would have changed from the start if I had all the information in hand before starting the game. I would also find it helpful to have a real-time reporting gauge that shows me the proportion of funds used to date on knowledge, on protection and on insurance, having this would be useful in my decision making. </div>
