    <div class="field-value">The knowledge and understanding of risk management was satisfactory. A good point is illustrated in the last two sentences of the first paragraph. But, in the second paragraph you misunderstood the term trade-offs which made you to explain what you did for insurance, research and protection rather than explaining the tools/resources you gave up while making the decision. 
A further explanation of how preparation affected development would help in making the reflection stronger, for instance you should also have included that preparation also had positive impacts in development. Moreover, you should have added a conclusion of what you have learned in the game.</div>
