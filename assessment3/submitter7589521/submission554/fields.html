    <h1>Submission 554 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7589521, session_user_id: 6dc6af90d974dd780a2ba4d04aa2fda85aed9743)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game was to enable us to take informed decesion and learn from our mistakes. Initially when I played I put all the money in development without taking adequate insurance. Luckily a couple of meteors missed and I survived but not for long. After that I always took the highest insurance without realizing the severity of the meteors. So I spent more on insurance than what was necessary. It took a few iterations to find a good balance.<br /><br />After a while I found good balance between development, insurance and severity of meteors. At times I would stop development when the expected "chance of Hit" or "Severity" by a meteor was very high. But I still failed to cross level 2. I will play a bit more to find out the optimam balance between development, protection and uncertainity.<br /><br />I feel the game can get rid of the "Slider" next to Insurance button. Instead I feel you should add "coping" factor. "Coping" from back to back disasters is much tougher both in terms of emotions/physic as well as finances.</div>
