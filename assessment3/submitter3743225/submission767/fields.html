    <h1>Submission 767 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3743225, session_user_id: f032db0c20e97ec5e4e4df40a51f205704760a4e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management in any form is a “game” of making more
informed decisions, and better choices. I believe this game very well
illustrated both proactive measures (insurance, preparedness, research), and
reactive measures (need for information connections) that are essential to
think through and analyse complex scenarios. It was clearly visible, that some
choices have more immediate, but at the same time less efficient effects (raising
the level of the island); while others need time to be efficient, but have long
lasting effects (developing buildings). I liked the insurance option, and how
it effects my decisions as well. I always opted for the basic coverage only,
but at every level I felt the need to purchase insurance as soon as possible. Having
only basic insurance coverage may not be the most rational choice, but one that
was immediately apparent to me. The game also reflected well how risk
management sometimes is a complex multitasking matrix, constantly trying to
factor changes in decisions.</p>

<p>I have played the game twice, but aligned strategy within
one game as well. My first attempt was more of an intuition game, then as we
went ahead, I developed some sort of a strategy. I also found it useful to base
this strategy on historic events and not only my own experiences. Looking at
how to succeed, I also read through feedback from other learners (in discussions).
In general, this is a great way not to have to deal with all difficulties
yourself.</p>

<p>If I wanted to further develop the game, I would probably
add in a new government policy at one point, which you need to comply <span>with. (And the sudden implementation of a
random policy may be a very valid example from the country I am from.) In this
game, I could imagine a policy that comes in effect all of a sudden, as a way
of protection for future events, but immediately is also as a „burden” that
needs to be dealth with, within a limited time frame. Another aspect of
disasters that could be easily included is the amount of false information
popping up after each disaster (among the green ones, some red spots could also
pop up that you should not click on.) One needs to really pay attention to
figure out what are real, valid and useful pieces of information. All in all, I
believe this game was a good representation of basic risk management concepts.</span></p></div>
