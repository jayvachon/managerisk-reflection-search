Dear colleague, it is nice to read your game reflection. I enjoy reading and evaluating your work. Then, in providing feedbacks based on my observation;
1.	Strengths:
•	Your reflection is clear to understand
•	It is very good that you understand the central idea of the game as you stated that it is important to make balance actions between (community) development and preparation for risk on the one hand and balancing the use of different risk preparation powers/strategies – research/knowledge, protection and insurance on the other.
•	It is very interesting that you have suggested the consideration of the role of self-help groups as risk managers in the construction of the new version of the game. I think it is very insightful propose the risk management process of self-help groups reflected in a game so that it would be supportive in exercising risk management in a real world from the perspective of self-help groups. I appreciate a game incorporating the concept of self-help groups in risk management game because self-help groups within the community are immediate and the most nearby actors to be affected by shocks at the same time, as they are immediate actors to manage the risk of shocks given that their capacity is enhanced. Thanks for this idea. 
2.	Weaknesses:
•	Regarding the 2nd question, it seems that you stated the challenges you faced in terms of technical mastering of running the game. Rather it would have been better to state in terms of the conceptual challenges you faced or what conceptual mistakes you made in the first playregarding risk management preparation or in applying the three powers for risk preparation; then what did you learn from your first play and then what conceptual changes  (for example in balancing between research, protection and insurance) you made in the second play to achieve better risk management. Regarding the lessons you have learnt from the game, while you have indicated that you have learned about different strategies and measures, you did not show that what strategies and measures should be used and how 
•	Regarding the 3rd question, while it is innovative to suggest to represent self-help group risk management within community, I think you failed to show how the self-help group risk management could be played as a game and how different concepts and/or strategies of self-help groups’ risk management could be represented or incorporated in the game. Again, you failed to show how your suggestion matter in the place you live. 
	In summary, I suggest that when you are given assignment like this game, it is important to ask first what goal is planned to be achieved or what information is planned to be conveyed in the course under study. That means what knowledge can be obtained from doing the assignment that can be applied in any other related context than in specific context like in context of avoiding the risk of hitting comet in the game.  

Wish you all the best!
