    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The main role of the risk management in the Game is to give/recieve opportunities to develop society on the planet. We have 3 main options to protect the planet from the risk of damages: knowledge about comets, protection of the infrastucture and insurance of possible damages. The preparations for all 3 options allow to recieve good or bad effects after some time. The quality of effects depends on quality of preparation (knowledge, insurance and protection). To get the better preparation you need more money, more attention and more skills how to use all of 3 options effectively. As for me the last (skills) was the most difficult part of the Game. You need to play tutorial for better skills. However after that you most likely did some failures and very possible they will be fatal for the society on the planet:-)</div><div>After my fatal errors and ending of the life on the planet I have understood needs to pay attention on the money and developing. I have tried to make my own strategy to play longer. The first step - insurance. If you dont have money, skills, enough attentions etc. - your planet strongly must be insured!!! More money gives you better insurance. The second - pay attention on developing of society. If you will have more developed society you will have more resources for better risk management. The third - collect more knowledge about comets. You need to be very attentive in this occupation. It can give you a chance to cut costs of insurance and protection. Sometimes knowledge can surprise you and comet seems not so dangerous as by the first look;-) After all, the last (fourth) item in my strategy for this Game were to protect. All money which I got from society I have directed to improve protection. And after all I recieved a good synergy: more developing society give me more opportunities of protection, better protection and knowledge let me cutting expences for insurance, spared after that money give the opportunity to direct them for developing.Â </div><div>It seems very easy plan to implement, but in real life its not so gorgeous. I know it because live in Ukraine. Unfortunatelly now my country probably the best example what can happens if you dont have risk management at all or dont have strategic risk management. War with neighbor country is the risk too. State and society in my country faced with that kind of risk and we pay now so terrible costs by human lifes because our risk management were awfull bad. We didnt have ane strategic plan to defend our state from East. Its awfull that more than 80% of army forces and 100% of strategic power were concentrated in central and western part of Ukraine. It means we didnt have knowledge about real plans of Russia for Ukraine. Moreover, ukrainian army is one of the cheapest army in the world. Our army dont have most commonly ammunition, fuel, even clothe for soldiers etc. Moreover we dont have any insurance - any state in the world dont have obligation to defend us. As result we didnt have anything to deal with this bloody risk: no protection, no insurance, no knowledge. Do not repeat the mistakes of Ukraine. War is the same risk like others. Any state and all mankind need to have a risk management for that.</div><br /></div>
