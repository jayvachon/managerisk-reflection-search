    <h1>Submission 1516 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1912288, session_user_id: 0a1db6e1b5ccda0a5861c16a233719abbe28f425)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><i><b>The role of risk
management</b></i> in
the game I learnt how to plan and draw strategies that can give you some
resilience because with the resources (pods and the island) available you plan
for them equitably.</p>

<p><b><i>Knowledge</i></b><span>,
here you are tasked to carry out research especially on comets look at severity
and the impact that it might have on the investments on the ground in this case
protecting, my pods . Knowledge gathered from different comets help
in the process of planning as you strengthen the pods against the chance of hit
and also buy insurance to cover for the losses that might occur. </span></p>

<p><i><b>What
was done  differently</b></i>, I played the
game twice it helped, for the first time I had little knowledge concerning
coming up with strategies to minimize on the impact of the comets this turned
out to be a lesson and managed to balance the game where by I had to put as
many pods as I can because they kept on increasing my income slightly raised
the ground because raising it so high it is expensive to maintain. Consequently
I managed to reduce on the on damages through repairs and this would increase
my income.</p>

<p><b><i>Developing
a new version of the game, </i></b><span>I would suggest including
participatory approach in the game, because in this game the whole island’s
survival highly relies on one man’s shoulders yet it depicts the image it’s a
community and their involvement is fundamental in the planning process.
Regardless of relying on the insurance coverage it would be equally important
to incorporate the international humanitarian intervention because in case the
risk is tougher than anticipated we really need their informed view about risk
management. </span></p></div>
