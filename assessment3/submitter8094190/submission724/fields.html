    <h1>Submission 724 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8094190, session_user_id: 0c9061c3db12e8ad3d2d2d7044a88dfff0323231)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">We can’t avoid risks, but we should try to minimize their consequences.
As important  as investing is teaching, researching and prevention.
Researching give us information about future disasters . It helps us in taking decisions related with materials, products or laws we should use to reduce losts.
Insurances protect our assets and our investments and in many cases generates more investors or donors.
Playing this game  I realize how difficult is develop many proyects. How expensive is start them and how slow they  improve and, of course, how many risks affect them.
In this game study the comets as a possible disaster, helps us to be ready, to cope their consequences which most of the times can’t be avoided
Protective measures are an important part in all developing proyect althoug it could slow down its development.

Playing my first game I built only one plot which was developed as much as possible, i bought an insurance policy and spent a lot of resources ring the island. I obtained an awful result.
I tried again using a different estrategy. I only developed a couple of plots an imporve them twice. I bought an insurance policy and spent the rest of the money in protective assets. It was a wrong strategy too, because while I spent this money development was too slow and i couldn’t reach the target on time.
Next games I realize that  development o f the plots is essential to win the game, so I built more than one with a non stop development. I reduced the cost levels avoiding buy an insurance policy and eliminating the spending on protective measures till the research indicated that we will suffer an extremely high probabilty hit and finally an can reach next level.
It is not an easy game but real world is not too.
