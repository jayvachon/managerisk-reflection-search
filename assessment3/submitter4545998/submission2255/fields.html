    <h1>Submission 2255 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4545998, session_user_id: c910428e0018c19a41b6e6fb391fa702d3f60c20)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li><p><span>The
role of risk management in the game is balancing between risk preparation and
the community’s development. Within the limited resources of time and money, the
goal of risk management in the game is to build a strategy that can mitigate
the negative outcomes of being hit by the comets while creating the
opportunities for the community to grow. Risk preparation plan is the
combination of three activities: knowledge (research), protection, and
insurance. </span></p></li></ol><p><span>          Knowledge (research) is to collect
information about the potential risks and using that information for preparing
the response. Protection is the action that helps to     prevent or reduce the losses.
Insurance helps to recover the repairing cost and the time loss of the
development.  </span></p>

<p><span>         There is a trade-off among these activities. For
instance, if spending a lot of times on the research, the developing progress will
be delayed. On the other hand, if spending too much money on protection or
insurance, there will be not enough resource to improve the community. The key is depending on the individuals’ choices how to balance these
activities for a better outcome. I made my choice based on my judgment which
relied on the knowledge and on available resources.</span></p>

<p><span>         At first, I tried to build the pods as
much as I could with all the money I had. As the time went by, the fund was
built up, I then tried to prepare for the protection. When the comets appeared,
I spent time for research to learn about the potential hits and the possible
outcomes. The information obtained during the research helped me to determine
whether to raise the level of protection or to purchase an insurance policy. I
often prefer to raise the protection level rather than purchasing an expensive
insurance plan. Risk preparation affected significantly to the development in
some ways: it could halt the developing process immediately due to run out of
money or the community’s improvement could be delayed after some time. </span></p><p><span></span>2.      I
lost level 3 in the first time. I paid too much attention on development; prepared
less for protection; and ignored research and insurance. I got hit badly; it
damaged and destroyed almost 40% of my works. I had no insurance plan in place for
recovery and I had no time to make any connection with the community. I passed
level 3 in the second time but failed at level 4. I changed strategy in the
third time: spending more times for research; raising the protection level; and
purchasing insurance at the minimum amount. Finally I was able to pass level 6.</p><p>The
game reflected a real life scenario where a community was facing with many
potential shocks and that could hinder its development. The main things that I
learned from the game were the benefits of risk management; the relationship
between risk management and development; and some certain ways to manage risks
effectively. By balancing among the activities of risk preparation, the
community was able to meet its goal with limited resources of time and money.</p><p>3.    As
we have learned, risk management is a powerful instrument which can save lives,
prevent crisis, and unleash opportunities for the development.</p><p>Human lives are the most
important element in crisis management. Natural disaster is the highest risk for
human being which can occur at anytime, anywhere in the world .If I was tasked
with developing a new version of the game, I would suggest adding human element
to the game. This element, in my opinion, represents the best interest of risk
management choices. Human capital plays an important role in development. <span> </span></p><span>
