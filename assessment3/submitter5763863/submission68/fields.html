    <h1>Submission 68 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5763863, session_user_id: f38f9975b5872c78210371bbcb8a5abf2c21b819)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management had an essential role in this exercise. There was a probability of an asteroid crashing into the small colony i had built, and depending on the severity of the impact, it could cause the colony to collapse. Three key parameters were used to assess the situation: 1. The likelihood and severity of impact, 2. The elevation of the colony, as assessed based on severity, and 3. the insurance policy to cater for damages.<br /><br />The choice i had to confront were based on a tradeoff between money, which could either be used to invest in risk management, or saved for the growth of the colony, through upgrades and building new pods, or a mix of both. Both were essential, since without building new pods and upgrades, i could not have a stable income, which was necessary to invest for risk management.  Depending on the impact probability, the resources had to allocated to managing the risk rather than building pods initially. Had this not been done, the first pods would not survive and the game would end.<br /><br />I played the game more than once, as the first time i did not use the lever to match the impact bar on the left side. Low elevation of the colony led to its early annihilation. If i could play the game again, i would concentrate on keeping the elevation to a optimum level based on the probability and impact of the risk. <br /><br />If i could add one more thing to the game, i would quantify the values of the meteroids, which would then show the value through P x I, and this wold help in understanding the exact plan of action per risk. I would also try to create a matrix, which could help in quickly having a response plan based on the impact. </div>
