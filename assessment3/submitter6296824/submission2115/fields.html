    <h1>Submission 2115 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6296824, session_user_id: 38614deceffd1d3e1b7471cbe4b369042d70d2bb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This game
let me experience the importance of a perfect equilibrium between development
and conservation. It was really challenging to decide whether to invest in
developing more buildings or buy insurances to cover the possible meteor attack
that could destroy what you have built, and if it will worth it to rise up the
land to win more points by increasing the severity received.</p>

<p>The game
illustrates some topics previously analyzed at the course but I believe this
could include some more topics or opportunities to develop protective strategies
not only preparing yourself for the meteor collision but to help you avoid this
meteor collision causalities. It also could more realistic by giving the chance
to invest resources in another item that only gives you more wealth and not
increasing the risk or severity of the land.</p>

<p>I really
enjoy to play this game cause keeps you in continuous tension of the risk in a
meteor collision on your lands. This illustrates pretty well how important is
to take good decisions at the appropriate moments and how to use your resources
giving you the opportunity of accepting more risk exposing more the possible
damage the buildings and the land could receive.</p>

<p>By this
time I’ve concluded my Actuarial Sciences Bachelor degree and this topics about
the properly distribution of resources and the risk conscience it’s a very
interesting and important way of living that I take every day. Even when you
drive your car going to anywhere you should measure your risks by analyzing whether
the effectiveness of a route or the gas consumption you will get by following this
route or even if it is better to use the car rather than the bus or a cab. Risk
management it’s an everyday development of good decisions expecting the best
results by the proper choices.</p>
