    <div class="field-value">it is nice to have someone reaching level 5. it shows how the player has internalised  the experiences provided by the game.
it is a good suggestion to also show through some appropriate statistics the speed at which the highest level was achieved, the overall time limit notwithstanding. I believe that the interaction among the startegies also should be accounted.</div>
