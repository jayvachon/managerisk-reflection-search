    <div class="field-value"><b>Reflection for Game</b>

<br /><br />

At first, I wondered why there was a time limit for each level. The island did not need to develop in leaps and bounds in a short span of time. But then it struck me that all businesses have targets. Governments too need to adhere to development targets promised in their manifesto, else face the dire of the vote bank. Thus, the time constraint became a very prominent constraint in my developmental plans. Unlike a corrupt democracy, I was accountable for not achieving the target set for me.

<br /><br />

It is here that the trade off between protection and insurance with growth emerged prominently and consistently. The risk of potential monitory loss in the disaster should be measured with the potential monetary loss in redevelopment. As in the initial stages, it seemed more feasible to rebuild rather than insure. This could be why there is low incentive for people in developing countries to insure. They’ll just pick up the pieces and start over. But when the economy grows, the opportunity cost of not insuring also grows.

<br /><br />

It is also here, that I would like to examine the context of India. India has instated several protection measures to protect the interests of the country. However, in doing so, it has achieved the opposite. The regulations are so harsh and draconian, that investor sentiment has dwindled. For example, the recently passed Land Acquisition Act requires an enterprise which wishes to redevelop an area of land to acquire 80% approval of the community resident there. It also has to bear the costs of the rehabilitation of those displaced. Another example of a countercyclical measure of protection is the retrospective amendment of the Income Tax Act to collect over Rs. 20,000cr in capital gains tax from Vodafone which transferred assets outside the boundaries of India. That being said, countercyclical measures such as import restrictions, bans and increase in taxes on gold imports has helped contain India’s CAD as well as stabilize the rupee.

<br /><br />

Coming back to the game, I did not succeed in the first round. Rather, it took me three trials to successfully complete Level 4. Through the repetitiveness, I observed the pattern of the severity and probability of a meteor attack. I learnt that the initial levels had a low probability of an attack with less severity. Hence, there was no need to sacrifice precious finances on insurance where there was a low probability of damage. (Why would I buy insurance against a flood if I live in the Sahara?) Instead, I focused my reserves on revamping protection to meet the largest perceived severity, so that cheaper insurance could be purchased in future levels. This clearly shows the importance of data collection and constant monitoring to estimate future shocks. 

<br /><br />

A trade-off between protection and insurance thus surfaced. On the one hand, there is greater scope for financial loss if protection is insufficient, while insurance would breed negligence and moral hazard.

<br /><br />

Lastly, the role of the community in disaster mitigation was not very apparent. Therefore, a suggestion would be to increase liability on the part of the player, i.e., to admonish him not just for not meeting development targets. For example, if the level of damage (after insurance) increases beyond a certain amount three times in a row, a no-confidence motion is passed by the community. Further, progressively through the game, autonomous regions could manifest where the community manages their risk and their resilience is compared with ours.</div>
