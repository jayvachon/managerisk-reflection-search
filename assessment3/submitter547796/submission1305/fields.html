    <h1>Submission 1305 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 547796, session_user_id: 7cd3dda1afa8e39e951267b7e1fcaf8d698fd63c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management played a pivotal role in this game in
prioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them. Its role can be outlined as
below:</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>To ensure long-term survival of the community of
Alora</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>To provide immediate protection and relief from
shocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insurance</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>To ensure timely and justified protection at the
time of crisis</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Important choices had to be made for each crisis according
to its severity. Due to limited resources, it was
imperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimum
utilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching the
island, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basis
of certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance of
a hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I would
immediately start spending resources to build community connections and gather
knowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal in
safeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, being
comet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making a
trade-off between risk and resources, I was
able to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.</p>

<p>While making preparations for the shock, again a
trade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due to
limited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted so
that the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would not
upgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buy
insurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on development
due to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain more
resources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resources
was imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoided
by compromising on development while in the long-term lack of development
slowed down the process of growth of resources.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Having played the game more than once, I learnt certain
valuable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.
Initially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize the
risk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized that
development of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick pace
to face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary to
prepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, I
began prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordingly
spent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community against
the shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive the
barrage of incoming comets. </p>

<p>This game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-world
crisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of time
management, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct and
justified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Hailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize that
corruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequate
social administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in risk
management. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a just
and efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice to
all citizens of the community.</p>
