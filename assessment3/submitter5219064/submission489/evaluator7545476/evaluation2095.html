    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is that, for the most part, it is straight forward and easy to follow; the order of the answers correspond to the questions asked. Another strength of this reflection is that the cohesiveness between the paragraphs, in the first paragraph the student bring up the point about resource diversification, then again in the second paragraph, enhance the point of resource diversification.

One thing that I think could make this reflection better is, perhaps, to omit the second to last paragraph. I do not think the third questions asks about how to make the game better, but rather how could the game be changed to reflect the location the student is living in. (Though, I also found the third question a bit unclear when I was writing my own reflection for the game). (And another thing that could make this reflection better is to correct the minor typos.)</div>
