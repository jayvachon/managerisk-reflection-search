    <h1>Submission 418 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5481397, session_user_id: 32030b3d525cec8f2f6dce675dce67ed24a4b022)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game
of risk assessment the where 3 resources that had to be manage and balanced in
a correct way in order to succeed: knowledge obtained through research that did
not have an economical cost but was time consuming and on the other hand,
insurance and protection at a high economical cost. Also a fourth variable had
to be taken in to account during the game; uncertainty was present and
contributed to build a scenario where risk management strategies had to be
taken into consideration.</p>

<p>Research or
knowledge, I found to be the most important asset in the game. Whereas,
insurance was a fixed variable, with little options to it. As for protection, I
think I would place it in a second place, after knowledge and before insurance
as it would make a difference, but not as important as research.</p>

<p>My
conclusion is that non-quantifiable variables are the ones that make a big
difference and although they suppose some money (not in the game but they
usually do in the real world) the cost clearly pays off and sometimes they can
be simple things but very effective.</p>

<p>If I had to
add one thing to the game it would be a behavioral obstacle, either
overconfidence or short memory as often these are obstacles that make risk
management go wrong.</p>
