    <h1>Submission 209 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1771352, session_user_id: e803e972ffcaccd65b3a0e90940f52fbdb38441b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Pertaining to risk management as embodied in the risk horizon game,
hereunder are my observations. Firstly, risk management involves
tradeoffs. While  protection enhances the capacity to mitigate the impact
of future disasters (elevating the island tantamount to creating  wealth),
 it also has its  downside
which is   reflected in having less time to spin the comet off its destructive
sea-bound path. It also means that the higher one elevates the island, the more
expensive insurance becomes (reflected in the cost of any repairing the damaged
pods). This is because at lower level of the island insurance costs less than
when the island is elevated.  That said, early preparations and
protection  allow the player time to acquire knowledge through research
(more time to focus on spinning the comet up the sky). What I also found out
during my second attempt was that If I bought sufficient insurance and raised
the island to a certain height, it took sometime before comets emerged, which
meant that I had more time to develop the island. </p>

<p>I played the game twice, and for sure I found it scintillating but
challenging all the same. This is because the game gives the player a glimpse
at what it takes to tackle risk. While protection as manifested in elevating  the island enhances the capacity to mitigate
loss in the event of  future disasters,  protection by itself is insufficient to do
away with loss entirely without buying  insurance  protection that reduces the  cost of damages, albeit mitigated. In other
words,  eradicating the destruction from
future  disasters is not possible let
alone feasible,  rather risk management
should be done through proactive measures  (preparations knowledge acquisition, protection
and buying insurance).  I noticed that
the interface changed during my second attempt. During my first attempt, as far
as I can recall, the message on how much I gained by protecting the
island(elevating it), was a lump sum  figure as was the amount of money I
spent during my repairs and research work. However, during my second messages
pertaining to those aforementioned issues popped up as I engaged in the
activity.</p>

<p>The first time I played the game, I got so messed up that I almost gave up.
However, with time I realized I had to develop some strategies right from the
outset.  I realized that raising the island, provides the player with
resources  and saves on the insurance premiums initially, allows more time
to undertake  development, acquisition of
knowledge, that bolsters preservation and social capital harnessing
(relationships). However, overtime Insurance cost rises, with the implication
that cost of damages soars substantially. One takeaway: not to deprive vital
resources for future development , investment  in  protection
and insurance should be early and at just sufficient level. Moreover, insurance
should be bought early before premiums surge once a disaster strikes, saving
ample time to acquire research knowledge that hastens development
capabilities.</p>

<p>What I would add, or enhance is the feature that shows underscores the
importance of  collective effort (social
capital) in preparing  for disasters, mitigating
suffering or losses in the wake of disasters, and recovery from disasters.
Social capital increases societal  awareness of the potential loss from future
disasters, fosters capacity building through information creation, updating and
sharing on potential disaster  cost,  possible ways to protect individual
livelihoods (solidarity), reduces the burden of  rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. Adding
a feature that highlights the importance of bridging and linking social capital
can make the game more realistic.  It
could also be better if a feature that underscored the importance of learning
(acquired knowledge is not easily lost but becomes an asset is bequeathed to
future generations.  </p>
