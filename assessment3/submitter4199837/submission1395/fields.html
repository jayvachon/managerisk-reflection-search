    <h1>Submission 1395 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4199837, session_user_id: 666ec4d7d9116fa90aae340ea8b4201503e21891)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Playing
the game was, in fact, a wonderful learning experience. It was quite like a
hands-on-approach to learning. I got so hooked to the game that I played it
several times over.<br /></p>

<p>At any rate, what I learnt from
playing this game was that development work must begin in the earnest. Though
simple development work is not all, it is wise to buy maximum insurance at the
very outset, when resources are more fully at one’s disposal, in anticipation
of a possible threat. As soon as insurance has been bought, it is time to focus
on putting in place mechanisms of protection to prevent devastating losses. </p>

<p>It is advisable to being to observe
threat, and conduct research on it, as soon as it emerges. Based on your
research, you should assess how much protection you need. Unusual amount of
attention paid to protection mechanisms can seriously stall your development
work, hamper growth, curtail important resources, and even take attention off
from threat analysis. Once sufficiently secured, you should focus on upgrading
your physical structures, bringing in protection through adapting your
structures to be better be able to cope when a disaster hits. All the while
research on, and observation of, possible threats must continue, because it
allows a bettered response, and you are better prepared to deliver it. Response
to disasters is best done through linking the community and making it act
together, and in cooperation. </p>

<p>Too much expenditure of resources, and expending them too
quickly also sets you back. You should conserve resources to things like buying
more insurance or repairing and instituting relief efforts after a disaster
strikes. You should start new development work only once physical structures
already in place are sufficiently upgraded and secured, to minimize losses.
This does not mean that you do not buy insurance for new development projects. Buy
insurance for all new physical infrastructure, and otherwise, as soon as
threats emerge and your research tells you odds of you being high are high.
Conversely though, If statistical data predicts that chances of a threat
actually making an impact on development are very low - low to the point of
insignificance – it is okay to ignore such threats, and focus instead on
developing risk management mechanisms which will prepare you for a more
formidable threat. </p>

<p> You need to continuously upgrade
your protection in light of new analyses of severity of threats as may be
posed, or as may be emerging. A disaster that is more severe than you are
protected against or have insurance for, will leave a far larger trail of
destruction. Similarly, if you realize through your research that the severity
of any potential disaster would be very high, it is advisable to stop all
development, upgradation or similar work, and focus on developing protection,
and once the disaster hits, to move as quickly as possible, covering as much
ground as possible, to link communities up and form a joint response mechanism,
because some threats are too severe to be fully protected against. Mitigation,
thus, becomes key.</p>

<p>All this, and more, I have learnt
through playing this game. As you can see, I made much of the game. I think the
learning from the game confirmed, in many ways, what we have learnt through
lectures and our readings. I feel that the singularity of the threats posed is
something of a downside to the game. Perhaps, if we get a wider variety of
threats, with different protection, insurance and coping mechanisms, it would
make the experience truly enjoyable, and enhance the players’ learning
manifold. </p></div>
