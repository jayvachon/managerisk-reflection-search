    <h1>Submission 1040 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6651988, session_user_id: 52cb8c6bc604e6e7e15b876822f787652fb465be)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game illustrated how difficult it can be to choose to appropriate amount of protection and insurance to purchase to guard against risk - each time you spend money on guarding against risk you limit your development over time if the risk doesn't prove catastrophic. The game showed that the difficulty in making decisions that balance between these factors and also the severity and likelihood of the risk eventuating. The first time I over-purchased insurance and protection, so in future attempts I took on more risk in order to grow more pods. If I could make the game more life-like, you could differentiate between systemic risks and individual risks to each pod, as though each pod represented an individual. Or you could make it a town, where there were several types of risks - disease, fire, unemployment, crime, drought etc and complicate the insurance and protection measures to be taken for each risk.Â </div>
