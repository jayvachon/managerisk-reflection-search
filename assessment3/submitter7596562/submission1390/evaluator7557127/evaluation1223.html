    <div class="field-value">Great reflection - it almost exactly mirrored my experience and thoughts! I really like the suggestion of showing faces/pictures as part of the community resilience building as it would put a very real element to it and the user would get an understanding about what was happening.
I think this reflection is very strong and doesn't need anything additional.</div>
