    <h1>Submission 1590 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3198301, session_user_id: f2e42d4d140867bd7c89ee1fb74660e52536d0ec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"> The game is about a world in development, constantly being "bombarded" with meteors. It simulates risk management against systemic risks. In the game your goal is to reach a certain level of development while managing the constant overhanging danger of meteors potentially crashing into the planet. To increase you development level you have to spend funds, which you acquire over time (based on your development level). Managing the risk of crashing meteors are split in three: Knowledge, protection and insurance, and are represented by: Studying the meteors by selecting it, and therefor more accurately explaining the risk it poses. Using funds to raise your "city" on a hill, protecting it from waves caused by a meteor. And lastly insurance which gives you back 33, 50 or 75% of the damage, regarding what insurance level you buy.<br /><br />I used these three methods in the following way: Protection, to see what kind of threat the meteor posed. Knowledge was the base of my risk management and I acted out from what knowledge I was able do deduct from the meteors. Also knowledge seemed to give a "double" benefit in the game, as it both gave you a better idea of how the meteor was going to affect you, and it gave you more time to mobilize the community. After acquiring knowledge, i went to protection. If i could up my protection was within a certain range of what power the meteor could be hitting with, I would up my protection to counter the meteor impact. Lastly i used Insurance as a last backup. If i had problems getting my protection up to the level needed, or there were too many meteor at one time to manage. The fourth thing, not focused on in the game or tutorial, but which i noticed while playing was always keeping a bit of capital at hand. If you always spent your last funds on upgrading pods, then I had no money left for restoration for the the shit hit the fan. This seemed to be another aspect of knowledge which the game does not specify, but is significant when playing. My first time trying the game I lost at level 1. I think this is because I had to experience how the game managed, and how the different things worked and affected gameplay. Afterwards I thought of it as yet another part of knowledge needed to play the game properly. The next try, I made it all the way to level 4. So with added knowledge, I could quickly address the risks.<br /><br />If I were to redevelop the game, I would add a focus, or a little reminder after you have played to make sure that people playing it also noticed that knowledge about saving funds and understanding after experience also aided you in beating the game. So knowledge should really be the baseline for all risk assessment. I think in the place that I live. Using  knowledge and experience to determine risks and handling these risks (and unforeseen ones) is underestimated. The ability to make a buffer part of your risk assessment is very important in my view.<br /></div>
