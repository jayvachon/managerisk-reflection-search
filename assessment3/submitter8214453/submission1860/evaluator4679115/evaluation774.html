    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is combining the learned materials with the actions of the game to describe scenarios.  Though the after thoughts of the game does not describe the role of 'insurance' accurately, it was overall a good reflection of the game.

The reflection would have been better if the player had tried different strategies rather than just focusing on knowledge and protection.  Different roles played by knowledge, protection and insurance at different scenarios and how that reflects reality would have made the reflection more complete.</div>
