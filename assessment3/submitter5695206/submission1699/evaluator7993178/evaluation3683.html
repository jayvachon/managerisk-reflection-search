    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the student has not only answered the questions asked but has also brought out clearly the internal condition this student experienced while playing the game, and has asked questions to try and gain a better understanding of the actual role of the game. I think this reflection would be made better by some basic proofreading, especially in the second paragraph.</div>
