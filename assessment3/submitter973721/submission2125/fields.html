    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Reflections on the Risk Horizon game</span></p><p><span>Mauro Mendoza (mauromendoza@yahoo.com)</span></p><p>The game was not very clear for me because not very
well explained. I did not know how to start so I press meteors, added a
research an also press the different holes that appeared in the territory, and checked
the cost and press if I had enough amount to cover such cost.</p>

<p>In addition I failed to add more on research
because I press on “Research” and it did not respond, so I decided to press on
the small boxes that appeared below the word “Research”. I spent several minutes
pressing different buttons according my low game understanding. I did have enough
knowledge on the game and the time was a severe restriction to be able to think
and evaluate the actions to develop. I could not reach level 2. </p>

<p>However, in
general terms, I was able to understand, according with the purpose of the
game, the importance of <span>knowledge, insurance, and protection, although
the last I could not apply very clear during the game.  </span></p>

<p>After playing the game I considered that one of the
more important stage is the preparation for risk managing and it could be
included in a planning phase.</p>

<p>There was a clear emphasis in knowledge (research)
and insurance but not too much on people, government, culture, level of
poverty. I understand it is a very general game but we do not forget the human
dimension of any process.</p>

<p>Yes, I agree on the need to get all possible
information and get all possible insurance services, two of the main issues that
are very limited in developing countries. To provide an insurance any financial
institution, especially in developing countries, ask the poor people for some type
of guarantee, mainly in the form of land or any other valuable property.
Financial institution do not give free money, so we find the poor people face a
very high risk because if they fail on the insurance, they lose their lands. </p>

<p>Maybe it could be interesting to know more about
the risk of risk managing.</p></div>
