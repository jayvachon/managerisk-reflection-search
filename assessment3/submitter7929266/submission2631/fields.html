    <h1>Submission 2631 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7929266, session_user_id: 82a7f36d298ca9bb78db14f9dd0f7d783af60fec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><span>

</span></span><p><span>The game risk
horizon is a reflection of a community’s challenges and struggles for survival
within comets ‘always’ treating environment. This community must match this
risk substantially, using three strategies, to balance risk preparation and
healthy development.</span></p>

<p>The role of risk
management in this is to identity, assess and prioritize risks using research
to prevent shock as much as possible. In the game, the power of research, protection,
and, insurance, was the variables at the disposal of the player to achieve
resilience and attain development. . </p><p>

</p><p>The trade-offs
were the insurance paid to research and obstruct the comet meteor from hitting,
also protection cost incurred to raise the island and protect it from being
hit, by diverting comet meteor and reconstruct quickly after suffering damage
from each hit, in level one and two win.</p><p>

</p><p>Preparation
creates resilience and prosperity as you are able to research each comet before
attack, protect the community, while development takes place. The more we
research, the more accurate our information becomes. <span>Even
though the information, we have about comets are not perfect, but the more you
research, the more accurate our information becomes. That is why severity and
chance of hit change, as you spend more time on research. Struggling to make
community connections before a disaster? Try spending more time on research
especially severe comets that come back to back</span></p><p>

</p><p><span> It reflects and is symbolic with a community battling
to control droughts for instance, because drought occur frequently, the poor
face a situation where once they begin to rebuild their assets, the next
drought wipes out the gains, and recovery ensures again. </span></p><p>

</p><p><span><span> After the 1st won, I tried to
balance the risk preparation and healthy development, using the three powers;
research, protection and insurance, and was able to achieve a second win level.
</span><span>In level 2 won, meteor 1 seventy was 6 chances of hit 8,
Research, for meteor 2; severity was one, chance of hit 3, Research 3, for
meteor; severity 4, chance of hit 6 Research 6, and meteor 4 was; severity 1
and, Chance of hit 3, research 6, damage was at the cost of $194, 9% and
insurance paid was %64 and the comment that say “Did you even a little bit of
protection go a long way? Even if your pods are damaged, they‘ll be damaged
less if, you‘re protected this makes them easier to repair!</span></span></p><p><span>Negative Shocks
could be devastating and weakens people’s ability and willingness to pursue
opportunities and we must confront this courageously. The game is highly stressful and that is how the communities
that face that kind of situation feel, but a good preparation has potential of reducing
the stress and capturing resilience. Community connections help long term
protection and insurance. While we pursue development, we must remain connected
to our neighbors and community organizations, and help one another when shocks
come. That is why in the game, we connect our pods when a flood is incoming. We
must continue to research, protect and insure, that way; no sector of the
economy is neglected. Risk is a burden as well as an opportunity, and we must
be sensitive to our environment to identify them when they appear. <span>Matching
up challenges and struggle with risks/opportunities to create wealth, growth
and achieve development. And position ourselves to capture Resilience and co-
create prosperity by applying the art and science of collaboration to solve
complex problems.</span>The game
captured three aspect of risk management; knowledge which is research,
protection, and insurance. If I am tasked to improve on the work, I will
propose coping, along with research, protection and insurance.</span></p><p><span>
