    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the statement that in real life decisions are rarely taken unilaterally anymore and each decision-process involves a lot of negotiation. Negotiation is time-consuming and may actually increase risks for a particular community if no agreement can be reached. The one thing that would make the reflection better is for the author not to focus on the technical problems but I think this is a major concern too because if affected their performance.
