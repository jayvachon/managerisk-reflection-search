    <div class="field-value">The reflection  shows the effort the student made  to have an understanding of risk management. However I think that kowledge is very important because the more we know a risk  , the better we can take mesures to prevent it or protect .
I think also  that disaster is  predictible  because  it is the combinaison of risk and vulnerabilities.Research on risk and vulnérabilities can give some prédictions about disaster.
The student gave not ideas to improve the game,  despite the fact  he recognized that it was very difficult  to play. 
To improve the reflection the student may emphasises on the concepts given in  the course material and not consider only  his own point of view .
