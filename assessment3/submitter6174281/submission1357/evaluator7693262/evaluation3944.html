    <div class="field-value">The reflection clearly describes the connection between the insurance, protection and growth. The writer has understood the importance of the balance of all these components in successful completion of the project.
However, the write up could have been better if come thoughts were also given on the time which is always limited for projects. Spending too much time on one component of the risk management, for example protection, will leave you with very less time for growth and for other important components of the risk management. Further, the risk management is not just mitigation of the damages caused but whole process of planning to minimize should such damage occur and how we cope up even stronger after damages. Incorporating this two points will further make your write up strong.</div>
