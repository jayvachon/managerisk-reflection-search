    <div class="field-value">This reflection demonstrates that the student has understood the game and has gotten to implement the theoretical knowledge from the first two weeks into more practical circumstances. Although sometimes very descriptive and detailed about what the actual game entailed, it has nevertheless been done with an analytical twist. The strongest point in this analysis is primarily the suggestion of adding "Resources" as an extra element to take into account - as it varies greatly from country to country and has potential to aid in the event of adverse shocks hitting a society. A very interesting thought! 

The reflection is of quality standard but the text does need tidying up as certain grammatical, spelling and lack of proper spacing and punctuation etc at some points distract the reader from the interesting context. Overall a good piece of work! </div>
