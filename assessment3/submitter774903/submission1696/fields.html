    <h1>Submission 1696 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 774903, session_user_id: f8e3af32cd64d43702fa74f5a08b1954d4b70e44)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management as we have learnt throughout the 2 weeks requires planning and proper implementation.The game "Risk Horizon" perfectly complemented our learning of the first 2 weeks.In the game, risk management played an important role in saving the pods from destruction.The Knowledge about the comets( i.e. Research) helped in positioning and raising the island(with the slider) to take the pods to safety.Many of the comets missed the island causing no damage whatsoever.Also the proper insurance package helped the pods to recover faster and more economically, thus cementing the fact that insurance is an important risk management weapon.Proper Knowledge follows proper protection which is aided by good insurance measures.<br /><br />In the game,building the pods amongst the risk of comets was a challenging task.Personally, during the development of the pods I did research on the comets which helped me to increase the island level.I didnot require Insurance during the first 2 levels and was able to develop pods more effectively.The comets caused little destruction as my island level was high.During level 3 and 4 i faced economical crisis due to insurance and pod development(to fill the green bar) which taught me that unplanned development causes more damage and the repair cost is more.So development should be done more thoughtfully.Many a times i had to put research on hold in order to raise the level of protection which teaches you that mere knowledge about something is not important,its the time management between knowledge and its implementation which is more important.My preparation for risk helped me to save my pods from destruction and from any further financial crunch which allowed me to prepare for risk in a better way for the further levels.(As a result many comets missed my island).<br /><br />I played the game multiple times and i tried lots of things.Firstly i was skeptical of buying insurance packages as they were expensive but then i realised how much they reduced the cost of repairs so i effected them right from level 1.Then i concentrated on the fact if the pods are spaced very closely the damage would be larger,hence i spaced them at a distance from each other and i saw that the combined destruction is low as compared to the time they were placed closely.Also, i tried to spend more on protection sometimes than development and i saw that i ran out of time and my game ended which tells you that managing risk goes hand in hand with managing development.one cannot be stalled.its a continuous process.The game teaches you that the componenets of risk i.e. knowledge,protection and insurance are interlinked and their simultaneous execution can help to cater risk in a better way.Even if one componenet is missing the whole thing falls apart.Knowledge aids protection and insurance aids recovery.<br /><br />I would add the component of Resources available.Every Country or community has different amount and kind of resources at their disposal.hence their ability to manage risk also alters in the same way.Thus if we add the resources available in the game we can put a more clearer picture of risk management.we can change the availability of resouces through levels which allows the user to think about resouce usgae in varied risk conditions.<br /><br />Thank You!</div>
