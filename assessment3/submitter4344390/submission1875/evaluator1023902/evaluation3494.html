    <div class="field-value">Thanks for sharing this thorough reflection. I shared similar strategy as you - I just did not buy insurance at all. According to game mechanics, if I my protection is reasonable and I am able to connect communities, I am sure to not receive damages. Therefore, I don't need insurance. I have similar observation as you have for community connection. It relies on physical skills. I reason this is quite reasonable - community connection takes practice. The more you practice, the better you connect. This is why communities have risk management drills. </div>
