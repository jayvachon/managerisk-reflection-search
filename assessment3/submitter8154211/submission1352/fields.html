    <h1>Submission 1352 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8154211, session_user_id: a11b6bb46b93b378bc48bd530a4eb795a8c05bd2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Having defined Risk Management as the process of confronting risks, preparing for them and coping with the effects.

Though in the game (Risk Horizon) most of the factors were either controllable or uncontrollable. Controllable such as purchase of protection, building and upgrading of pods and expenses on insurance and uncontrollable such as frequency and severity of damages of comet and the chances of moving to another level.

Some of the choices I made were based on baises such as the under estimation of the severity of soe Comet and sometimes I delayed on my expenses on insuraynce due to procastination.
However with effective preparation for the comets by researching,purchasing of protection and buying of insurance on developing and upgrading pods,I spent less on repairs after leveraging on the insurance.

I learnt having played the game more than once  that I have to balance preparation for risk management for instance researching on comets, purchase of protection and insurance with coping with the effect and also bearing in mind my behavioural biases.

If I was to develop an easier version of Risk Horizon, I will make the energy level easier to build for instance make the parameters more than just about the pods for it to turn great, I will give chances of outright purchase of additional energy level then also give the option of premium insurance.</div>
