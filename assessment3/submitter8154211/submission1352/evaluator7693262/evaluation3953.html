    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is that the writer has described the whole reflection within a short paragraph, connecting all the important risk components. However, the write up could have been better if the writer could have used fully the allowable word count for the reflection write up to explain in detail. Nevertheless, the writer has touched upon all the essential components of the risk management.</div>
