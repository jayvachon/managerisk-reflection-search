    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that questions were answered to the point and their was no beating around the bush. Answers were brief and comprehensive.The one thing i suggest to make this reflection even better is that rather than answering in one para for all three questions all three questions could be explained separately for better understanding.</div>
