    <div class="field-value">It would have been nice for you to put the level you achieved. Eventhough you are not a game person, you understood perfectly well what it was about and used the elements. I beleived you skipped mentioning that one of the mos important elements in the game is the money you have, because the desicions you make depend 100% on that particular element. 

It was an excellent reflection, </div>
