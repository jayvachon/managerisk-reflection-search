    <div class="field-value">In my opinion, the key strength of this reflection is the effective use of the concepts of the course and their description using the game. More specifically I liked the idea that playing the game several times is as if gaining experience in risk management. The author could include a bit more specific explanation on how more value would be added to the game if the suggested improvements are implemented. Also it might be useful to illustrate further the understanding of the concepts by adding an example from the student's country risk management choices as asked in the third question. Overall, in my opinion this game reflection has valuable and interesting ideas that implement the main concepts discussed in the course, and they have been well and clearly explained. </div>
