    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>Natural disasters bring disastrous impact on the lives of human beings in many forms . Among these, the very important are non availability of food after calamities , loss of life , destruction of infrastructure . Bringing resilience after such disasters is involve many complex procedures which include mobilizing funds for restoration of roads , infrastructure and providing basic amenities to the people . The  exchequer has to source funds not only from within the country and also from other countries that brings long term consequences and adverse effects on the economy to the country . Natural disasters such as tsunami has totally devastated many lives in India and Indonesia . Though the Government has rendered monetary support , it has not ensured restoration of life of all the people affected by tsunami . In india , though it is said the name tsunami is new , history says that it was frequent in early times and historians have recorded the same in many writings and novels. Had the Government had taken due notice of it it would have taken adequate measures to prevent the same. Natural disasters affect the people in different form and level . The severity differ from each disasters ,and the level is also different. The comets in the risk game denotes the different disasters that affects the nation . Each comets has different level of severity , and many disasters like storm many times threaten the nation but do not affect the nation. But , nations are unfortunate many times due to the severe effect of disasters. To mitigate such risks, foreknowledge about the disasters is imminent . The technological advancement helps in identifying the disasters ,its origin , its movement and its destination. Though , this is very hard to predict , science has helped the nation to the maximum extent , and science has also helped in understanding the evil effect of the disasters. Information is vital as it gives the indication about its origin , its movement and the severity . However , the information can be effective only when preparation is made to mitigate the risk . In this game , building and strengthening the vulnerable areas helped to minimise the risk . The maximum risk range in the game went upto 37% . This could have reached the maximum of 100% , had not the community built a safe measures in the vulnerable areas. As was seen in the game , insurance played a great role in resuscitating the affected areas with less resources as financial support came from insurance . Therefore, as vividly presented in the game , information about the disaster , preparation and insurance helped the country manage natural disasters effectively with very minimal loss. </li><li>The game was played many times . The information was very useful , and during the games it was understood that the financial constraints was removed due to the support of insurance company . Though , the initial funding did not come from insurance , the community supported the development of safety measures , and subsequently more reliance was made on insurance which helped mitigate the risk properly. The loss could be averted . <br /></li><li>The game was perfect in all the senses as could be seen. <br /></li></ol><br /></div>
