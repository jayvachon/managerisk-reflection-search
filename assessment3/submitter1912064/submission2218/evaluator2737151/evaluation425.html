    <div class="field-value">The experience acquired from the game is clearly described. The reflection also shows evidences of good comprehesion of the concepts of risk management described in the course; you gave a very accurate example of how flooding risk is managed in Hong Kong. 
For the next time, i will encourage you to show more consistency in the organization of your ideas. I observed there are some questions that were not clearly answered. e.g: Suggestions about improving the game were missing at the end. 

Keep up! :)</div>
