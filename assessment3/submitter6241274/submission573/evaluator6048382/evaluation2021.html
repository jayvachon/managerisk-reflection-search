    <div class="field-value">Manelisi’s reflection highlights the need of availability of funds to be used not only during the preparation phase but also when coping with the damages towards overcoming the effects the disasters and to head to success.  Manelisi mentioned the prerequisites to face the challenges that are access to information-knowledge, thorough research, insurance, protection, to name just a few. Though  Manelisi  pointed out that the game was repeated many times, I am delighted by the emphasis on positive comity members and their full involvement to the success of an effective risk management. Manelisi suggests that the game may allow the use of a telescope and a timer that I think sounds very understandable to allow the preparation and to deal with the disaster. In the reflection of the previous classmate it was mentioned the need of sufficient funds for preparation and coping with the disasters and it was also mentioned in Manelisi’s reflection and I think that these observations may attract the attention of the worldwide  policy makers that there is a need of mutual help to make available necessary funds for risk management of countries throughout the world. Thank you Manelisi for your thorough and instructive reflection! </div>
