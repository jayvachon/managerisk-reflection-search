    <div class="field-value">Clearly the author understands the game and has but a good amount of thought into different risk mitigation strategies. I like that his/her reflection applies the lessons from this game to real life, looking at how risk affects actual people, and how it can have severe consequences for people who are not able to mitigate. However, I think s/he would have been more successful had s/he better balanced insurance and protection rather than relying simply on protection. While a certain level of protection is effective against some comets, it is extremely expensive and offers little protection against serious impacts. Insurance allows you to rebuild quickly and cheaply after a major impact, usually leaving money behind for additional protection if needed. </div>
