    <h1>Submission 2214 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1250589, session_user_id: 59b51d139e9de09ff3bfbc74de1d1d0b7deecefb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of the risk management in the game was large. In order to succeed in 
the game I had to try to prevent damages and also fix the damage after it had 
occured. So same time I needed to prepare for the worst, and also take preventive measures and 
think what can I do after if a damage occurs. Building and upgrading pods was 
needed so I could enter the next level. Same time I had to think other things 
such as investing in research and thinking what type of insurance I need. 
Research was  important in order to predict where and when action  is mostly 
needed. Also insurance coverage paid a part in the overall risk management. By 
purchasing insurance I was able to cover the damage caused by the accidents.  I 
had only limited financial resources and short time to invest in different 
activities (like building pods). I could not do everything that I 
wished for. A balanced view on preventive actions and insurance and community building seemed to be the 
best way. I think in real life the situation is like this, and people (and policy makers) need to think 
how to use limited resources in the best possible way. There was a time gap between 
the protection and development, so the results were not visible right away. That made the cause-effect relationhip more difficult to understand first.</p>
<p>I played the game many times, and as things in life usually go, practice 
makes perfect.  I needed to read the instructions again when I noticed I still didn't know how to play well. I learnt many things after the first trials and always adjusted 
my actions for the future strategies. For example, I learnt that I don't need to 
save my money but instead should invest more in developing the community.  Only 
after I did that, could I move on to the next level. </p><p>If I should change something in 
order to make the game better, I would show the instructions somehow better in 
the beginning. People must have a good knowledge on things in order to know what to do. This would in real life translate into having an education on the topic of risk management and tools related to that (either formal or informal education). I think also trial and error teaches us a lot, but knowing the rules of the game, i.e. being educated on important things in advance, is vital in my opinion. </p><p>Overall, I learnt quite a lot from this game. Most important lesson I learnt was that I should study instructions before I start something, i.e. have an education or training in real life. That changes a lot.</p></div>
