    <div class="field-value">The ultimate reflection in the last answer is interesting and very realistic, although it would not be as practical to be represented in the game, as too many things will have to be drastically reviewed from zero. The theoretical concept is by the way relevant and appreciated. 
I personally do not think that playing the game only twice is enough to effectively understand how to well balance the risk management intruments made available. Indeed, when you mention meteorites INEVITABLY hitting the ground, there you show you did not get how to avoid the occurrence of adverse outcomes, which means, you gave too much credit to insurance (as I also did on the first times I was playing), while not enough to research (which instead brought me to reach the last level). 
Last comment, no descriptions have been detailed about the terminology of knowledge, protection and insurance.</div>
