    <div class="field-value">The author clearly represented how he/she played the game and I learned how to improve my own score in future attempts. I also liked how the author related the aspects of the game to the risk and opportunity coursework and real-life terms. One, non-substantive, way this reflection could be better is if the reflection had been better proofread - the grammar and spelling in the review were sometimes distracting. </div>
