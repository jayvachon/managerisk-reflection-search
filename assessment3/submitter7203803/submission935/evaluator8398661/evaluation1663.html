    <div class="field-value">It is possible to understand how the student faced the game and what he has learnt from his several tries.
I think that the reflection would be better paying more attention to formality: I would avoid grammatical errors (‘to rasie’, ‘trys’ etc) or non-appropriate expressions (such as ‘XD’).
From a substantial point of view, I think that the only problem concerns the explanation of the game in the first paragraph: it is not easy to understand which were the resources (time doesn’t seem so important) and how it was possible to monitor the risk. 
Consequently, it is not clearly understandable how the definition of ‘knowledge, protection, insurance’ given by the course is linked to the game.
