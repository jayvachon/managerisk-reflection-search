    <div class="field-value">Great job! Your writing is better than most native English speakers. I liked how you reflected on the strategies you adopted while playing the game, and the costs and the benefits of each one. I agree with you that raising the land seemed to be the most cost-effective way to guard against risk. Like you, I found that initially insurance was useful but became too costly as one built out his colony. You also address a great point in managing the speed in which you develop your colony.  

Keep working on your writing style. While there are a few grammatical and stylistic errors, you are a natural essayist.
  
P.S. If you liked this game, but are looking for something with a bit more depth that addresses politics, I would highly recommend Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri if you can find a copy. See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Alpha_Centauri.  </div>
