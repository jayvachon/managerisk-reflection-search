    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is its emphasis on key learning points garnered in direct relation to the game itself i.e. a more micro viewpoint. Inclusion of learning perspectives from a more macro point of view i.e. general observations that are applicable across various circumstances/situations may make this reflection more encompassing. A slightly more in-depth definition as to why preparation to manage risk does not have an immediate bearing on development may also likely help solidify this reflection. </div>
