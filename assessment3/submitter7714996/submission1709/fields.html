    <h1>Submission 1709 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7714996, session_user_id: 7b5e84cae10a80a9f1c4e4c510eb7c6b4a9f8fbb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The planet Alora is constantly threatened by
meteors that hit its surface, provoking waves which damage the pods in the
planet; in this context, the aim of the risk management is to allow the
development in the planet. </p>

<p>First of all, as I knew that the planet would
be hit sooner or later, I started by elevating the village, that is to say
getting a low level of protection, which make it possible to quickly research a
medium-high level of protection when a meteor with a medium-high power of devastation
got closer. This action prevented the constructions from being hardy damaged,
or damaged at all; so the development kept on growing. </p>

<p>Additionally, when a meteor was getting closer,
I decided to carry on some research so I could asset how much damage it could
cause and the probability of hitting the planet and either rise the level of
protection in a short time or get a more protecting insurance. This action
allowed to adjust the level of protection and insurance to the expected
damages, although the forecast sometimes failure, and save some money for
building and upgrading pods. </p>

<p>As a basic action, I have kept certain
insurance almost all the time as the planet is constantly threatened. The level
of insurance chosen was never low, but medium or high. Concretely I have
invested in a high degree insurance when the severity and chance of hit of the
meteor were high or/and when I have already built and developed several pods. In
this sense, I have decided not to seek for the highest level of protection, as
the cost of it did someway hamper the investment in development; however thanks
to the insurance the money and time needed to repair the pods were relatively
small. </p>

<p>I opted for the above measures the subsequent
trials after the first attempt. The main thing changed was building and developing
pods more quickly. First time I devoted most of the time to rise the village. While
doing that, I was not building/upgrading pods, so when I had to repair the pods I almost run out of money. Therefore, the other times I acted more quickly and
I started building and upgrading pods while rising the level of protection. I
also decided to stop investing on protection to get a higher insurance when the
meteor was too severe, what I got to know by investment on research.</p>

<p>Below, the main aspects I have learnt are
important related to risk management:</p>

<ul><li>Keep certain level of
     protection, as risks are always present. </li>
 <li>Rise the level of insurance
     when the risk is extremely high is more convenient that trying to get the
     highest protection, as protection costs get quite high from a certain
     level and the insurance ease the reconstruction after the damage is cause.</li>
 <li>As the development gets bigger
     the losses of a hit are bigger too, however the bigger the development is
     the more budget is available to cope the risk.</li>
</ul><p>Finally, if I had the opportunity to change
something  in the game, I would implement
at least one more measure of protection, I mean, it seems to me that sometimes
rise the level of protection was too time consuming and expensive. However, in
the real world the range of actions to protect from a risk is wide and sometimes
with little time and budget it is possible to implement effective measures.
Another good advantage could be to include not only risks but opportunities,
keeping the same structure of risk management, so it would be possible to
accelerate the development too. </p></div>
