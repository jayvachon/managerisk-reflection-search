    <h1>Submission 1788 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2114133, session_user_id: d624a724c064f2139105434f7cd289fcc62eb602)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The game is a  metaphor, analyze how balancing effectively between risk management options (purchase an insurance plan, and increase the amount of protection your island has) leads to healthy development ( to win, you need to build and upgrade your pods). </div><div><br /></div><div>To do well in the game you need to think strategically - meaning think about the balance between preparing for risk and investing in developing your community; but also thinking about the different tools you have at your disposal. For example, when I first played I put too much emphasis on insurance, and could not easily progress past level 3. Then I realised it is not enough to rely on insurance after the fact, you also need to invest heavily in protection.</div><div><br /></div><div>The balance between risk preparation and developing your community is (intentionally) difficult to reach. If you spend too much on building and upgrading pods, you will be exposed to comets when they hit. When you sustain damage from comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if you spend too much on preparation for risk, you will not have enough money to develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.</div><div><br /></div><div>This is a balance policy makers have to consider all the time. They have limited resources, so there is a tension between spending up front on risk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but may not hit) or to spend on other development priorities. </div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>the learning goals of the game are: </div><div><br /></div><div>1.     How should they spend their money? the balance between preparing for risk and investing in developing your community</div><div><br /></div><div>2.     Distinguish between different risk management activities (knowledge, protection, insurance, coping), and identify examples of these activities in different settings.</div><div><br /></div><div>3.     Identify the types of obstacles that often impair risk management and how these can be prioritized.</div><div><br /></div><div>4.     Recognize actions and reforms that can improve risk management and reduce the obstacles to it.</div></div>
