    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of
risk management in the game was to reduce the drawbacks caused by shocks when
the planet was hit by comets. The idea behind the game required the player to
pay attention to both its land development while at the same time preparing for
possible losses through insurance and protection. The concept of risk
management behind the game meant finding the right balance between investing in
development, gaining knowledge and paying for protection and insurance. Paying for
insurance and/or protection involved some drawback in terms of development in
the short run, but benefits were seen later in the game. At the beginning of
each level the choice of investing either in development or in preparation for
risk had to be taken. By investing in development, I was able to lock in bigger
gains both in money and in development level, but I was uncovered if risks occurred.
If I chose to prepare for risk, I had to spend my money on insurance and
protection and hold off on upgrading and building. In the early levels, when
risks were smaller, a good insurance acquired in the beginning made sure that I
finished the level, but later on, it became insufficient. </p>

<p>I played
the game twice, but managed to reach only level 4 on both tries. I learned that
decisions have to be made quickly and that a balance between development and
preparation for risk has to be found. Analyzing the two separately is not
enough when possible risks are greater, even if it might work in more laid back
conditions. I also learned that when risks can be greater, both insurance and
protection are required, especially the optimal use of the two. If I were to
play the game again I would try to think faster, make decisions quicker, and focus
more on protection, not just on acquiring an expensive insurance, but I would
also keep the insurance. In terms of development, if the damages were reduced,
I think it would be enough to advance to new levels.</p>

<p><span>As a new
implementation in the game, I would make available the cost of protection, as
it is stated for the different types of insurance. In this way, players could
make the decision in a calculated matter, and not randomly. In terms of
choosing the right path when pursuing risk management I thing calculating the
estimated return is important when making choices and in a real environment I think
there would be time for some calculus when choosing the right balance between development,
knowledge, protection and insurance. Because the cost of recovering from shocks
can not be estimated in other way than by looking at past events and history
never repeats identically, I consider it important to have a clear
understanding of costs when it comes to preparing for risk. We cannot know the cost of recovering from shocks, but we can keep under control the costs of risk management. Besides that,
calculating the risk reward of paying for different type of preparation for
risk comes in handy when adapting a certain risk management path. We need to
know the short term drawbacks of every strategy and its long term benefits. </span></p></div>
