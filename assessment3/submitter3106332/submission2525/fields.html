    <h1>Submission 2525 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3106332, session_user_id: fd4558db67fb022602bb93657d613c0833fbae18)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was to mitigate the damage done to our pods due to the asteroid crashes. Insurance helped reduce my future cost in repairing pods and was really important for the development. It was delayed protection for risk response Also, the study of asteroid was an important point so that I had more time to minimise damage and also to understand the risk an severity of the damage they might cause.
The first time I played the pod development was a problem in which I built the pods disconnected and didn't result in development. However, during the future runs I understood that part and tried making the most of it to encourage the development. 
If I had to add one simple thing it would be possibility to attack these asteroids with a risk that it might not hit or might even explode right there. SO you have to judge it based on the asteroid's severity.</div>
