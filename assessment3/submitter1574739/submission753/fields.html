    <h1>Submission 753 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1574739, session_user_id: a9eb10138e0da46ccbebb2f57c32914c024f34a2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game is balance
between risk preparations and developing your community.</p>

<p>The whole idea is to
reach a level of growth by develop the buildings and at the same time you have
to keep your colony safe from a known danger. </p>

<p>It is crucial to have
available a minimum amount every time, in order to keep community safe. The
necessary amount can only be produced by developing your community level. </p>

<p><span>Like in the real word,
it is difficult to keep resources outside the production process for reasons, such
as emergency situations and increase and decrease these levels depending on the
level of risk and imminent disaster result.  
</span></p>

<p><span> If you spend too much on building and upgrading
pods, you will be exposed to comets when they hit. When you sustain damage from
comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if you
spend too much on preparation for risk, you will not have enough money to
develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.</span></p>

<p><span>The game is a very simplified
version of the actual conditions but the general principles are the same. The
knowledge of imminent dangers together with insurance resources and protection
actions (at the stage of preparations) are able to provide recover from losses
and make the most of benefits (coping stage).</span></p></div>
