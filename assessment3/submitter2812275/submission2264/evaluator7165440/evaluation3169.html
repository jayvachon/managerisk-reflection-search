    <div class="field-value">Key Strengths:
One key strength is the wording of the entire reflection, which assimilates technical words and their appropriate use in context. This shows that you have understood the key concepts and are able to articulate them to get the message across.
This reflection seems similar to the resources we have been going through in the past weeks and seems professional.
The main concepts are well-explained and linked to the game experience.
I also really liked the structure of the reflection and the explanation of the main points.

There's always room for improvement:
It would however perhaps have been better for things in certain parts of the reflection to be put more simply (in your own words) as this is a reflection of an individual on her/his experience of the Risk Horizon game.
Also, a deeper introspection of the game itself could have led to more suggestions on how to improve the reality component of the game to further fine-tune the understanding or risk management, although it is already close to perfection itself. An inclusion of the specific risks you yourself face in your environment would be an interesting addition / customization to the game.

(one small thing: in the second line in Role of Risk Management, the appropriate contextual word would be "lose", not loose... To explain the difference in an elementary way: win is the antonym of lose, tight is the antonym of loose.)</div>
