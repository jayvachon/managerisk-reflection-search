    <h1>Submission 906 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6824415, session_user_id: b3ff5a4ca2d63d1c3cd55401f0002f36b0d00295)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Risk Horizon game shows us the meaning of risk management. During this game, the players confront the trade-off  in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance. The goal of this game is to develop the world of Alora with preparation for the meteorite impacts. The players try to minimize damage caused by the meteorite impacts using three powers : Research, Protection and Insurance. But the use of these powers needs the resources. In other words, an exhaustive preparation for the meteorite impacts hampers the development of Alora. So during the game, the player must find a best balance between the development and the preparation for risk.  <br />      In the beginning, I attached a high value to the research during the game. I spent a lot of time and resources on the research. Because, in <i>World Development Report 2014(WDR14), </i>the authors said : " Because people face uncertainty when they confront risk, increased knowledge is an essential component of risk management. Increased information about risk can help people better understand the nature and likelihood of risks they may face, thus reducing uncertainty (pp.63-64)". After few failures, I understood that Research is less important than Protection and Insurance in this game. The player has only three minutes for developing Alora. So the player must take action like Protection and Insurance against the meteorite impacts in this game. By grace of Insurance, the player can reverse at low cost and rapidly the damage caused by the meteorite impact. I learned the importance of action for the preparation for risk from the game. In effect, in <i>WDR14, </i>the authors said : "Even if information exists, decision makers may be unable to turn knowledge into actions and behaviors that prepare them for risk (p.16)". After that I tried to raise my level of protection as much as possible. This measure was fairly costly but safer.<br />      After several plays, I recognized the vital importance of the timing of the meteorite impacts. If a meteorite impact occur at the end of the game, the player doesn't have time to rebuild the community. Because of the meteorite impact, the development bar becomes red. But the player can't change RED into GREEN on the development bar. It means "game over". This game is very much affected by a chance factor like real life. <br />      The most important thing in the game is to develop promptly the community. So the player needs to pour quickly money into the development of the community. Time of game is too short to wait to have ample money. But in the real world, it's better to save money and to accumulate the assets for preparation of risk. <br />      I think that this game is very useful to grasp some aspects of risk management. But I propose an adjustment about this game. I think that the role of Research isn't clear in this game. It's better to add weight to the role of Research and to increase the benefit that can be gained from Research in this game. For example, as a practical proposition, after several researches, the player can reduce the chance of the comet hitting and the severity of the comet.<br />   <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /></div>
