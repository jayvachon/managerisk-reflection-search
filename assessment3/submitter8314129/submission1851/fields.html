    <h1>Submission 1851 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8314129, session_user_id: f24cac4adf8a5858f4b2b92fd933b2d00bee5579)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management in this game plays the main
role. One needs to understand all factors that are given to prepare better for
the risky situation or afterwards be able to recover. In the first phase
of the flying object, the main focus was on the knowledge. Only then we can
understand the situation, and we can better prepare on the consequences that
come. With the knowledge we see whether we are able to protect ourselves only
by using our own resources that or it would be for us advantageous to insure
ourselves. When we are prepared and understand the situation, we have an
overview about it, damages are smaller and recovery is easier.</p>

<p>When we do things for the first time, we do not
know them. We try our best, to see what works. This is also the way of
learning. When repeating the game, we understand the risk and process better
and go further with the better results. In real life we could see this process
as learning from historical data. In my opinion this is one of the most
important things in the risk management. Only from this knowledge we better
understand the situation, we understand the factors that influence the risky
situation, we see what are the marginal effects and we can make predictions by
creating models. Using historical data we can adjust the models to the max and
so minimize the risk and prepare for the consequences.</p>

<p><span>Beside the three aspects of the risk management
that were captured in the game we should focus also on some others that help us
predict the situation better. These could be: checking the weather forecasts,
the cycle of repetition, understand the needs of the people living in the region,
understanding their willingness to risk etc. I live in Prague where the river
Vltava flows through the city. In year 2009 and 2013 there were big floods on
this river. It was very nicely seen how well was the city prepared when the
situation occurred for the second time. For example the huge city ZOO that is
placed near the river. They had prepared big save towers for animals that are
near the river. Some other were transported very fast to other ZOO so no animal
died. I think learning and focusing on the weather forecast was very important in
this case.  That is why I would add to
the game regular checking of the weather forecast to be better prepared for the
risky situation.</span></p></div>
