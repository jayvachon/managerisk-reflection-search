    <div class="field-value">1. The key strength of this reflection is that you can give an example which is the same as risk horizon game.

2. However, you can not win this game because you do not calculate the trade off between cost and target. You can win this game as I did. I already tried many combinations such as: a) (usual, sometimes, seldom) research, insurance (30%,50%,75%), protection (lv1, lv3, lv5); b) (usual, sometimes, seldom) research, insurance (30%,50%,75%); c) insurance (30%,50%,75%), protection (lv1, lv3, lv5); d)(usual, sometimes, seldom) research, protection (lv5, lv7, lv9). Finally, I give a conclusion that play as d choice (usual research and protection at least lv7), you will win this game at least lv5.</div>
