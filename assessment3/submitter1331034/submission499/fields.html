    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Role of risk management: <br />Once there are 1 or 2 communities created, purchase the most amount of insurance that can be afforded, while keeping some money in case repairs are needed. <br />Increase protection in small increments once 1 or 2 communities are created.  This provides incremental protection in the event of a hit. Over time, as I have more money to increase protection, my communities are better shielded from hits, and they take lesser damage. I have more time to make connections when I am hit and often are able to completely mitigate damage.<br />In time, knowledge in the form of accuracy about meteor severity and chance to hit helped me decide when to ignore a meteor completely and focus on community building (allowing the bar to turn green).<br /><br />2. I played it more than once. What would I do differently next time? <br />Build slowly. Ensure that building and protection are being built at the same time.  The first time, I grew my communities too quickly and I was unable to provide enough protection when struck by a severe hit. Expand communities (increase level) slowly too. After building or growing each community, wait to make sure the bar can turn green before building/expanding more. <br />Always buy insurance. <br /><br />3. What change would I make to better represent management choices that are relevant to where I live:<br />Biggest risk: Risk of systemic financial shock coupled with high risk of earthquakes common to this part of the world (California Bay Area).  <br />While systemic financial risk is not specific to where I live, the housing market in this area is very closely tied to the financial economy. I fear a major earthquake, which has been predicted to be long overdue for this area, coupled with a simultaneous shock to the financial market, which would in turn affect the high-tech industry (main-stay industry in this area), would cripple the economy here. Many will be out of work, unable to pay mortgages, forced to abandon or foreclose, etc. To reflect this in the game, the game could introduce unforeseen earthquakes. Since earthquakes are not easily predicted in real life, the fact is we never know when the big one will hit. In the game, there would be no way to achieve the right level of protection for it.  Some scenarios in the game can feature earthquake-only hits, with random levels of severity. Other scenarios can represent the culmination of a large financial shock and an earthquake (or several small earthquakes to represent a series of aftershocks), which will likely send the player scrambling to regroup the resources, and hoping there is enough money saved up for necessary repairs, sufficient insurance to mitigate damage, and some level of protection to reduce damage caused.<br /><br /><br /></div>
