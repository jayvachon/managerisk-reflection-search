    <h1>Submission 2522 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4350898, session_user_id: 0995fd21c8fc3955457b1d02de54883ff886ac71)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
the Risk Horizon game, I played the part of the government, and fully
controlled all of the investments that were made in the safety and development
of a certain community, in terms of 1) investments in research that bought us
more time right before shocks to build community relationships, 2) protection
from the shocks; 3) insurance for damages caused by the shocks. I definitely
felt the trade-off between investing in the different types of protection and
developing the community, because the resources were never quite enough to do
everything I wanted to do in the time that I was able to have between the
shocks.</p>

<p>At first, my
strategy was to always have the best insurance policy. This was the “easy”
choice because it could be done immediately right before the shock, while I was
busy developing my community to the maximum and investing in research when the
resources ran out. I didn’t invest at all in protection, because it took too
long to develop and I could never get past two bars. I always tried to keep my
research to the maximum for comets that were highly likely to hit and/or were
particularly strong. </p>

<p>What I realized
later is that it was not worth investing so much in insurance, and with the
money I paid “upfront” for this, I could use to develop my pods quicker, and
use the extra resources that came from them to increase my protection. Then, I
started to try to increase research and protection as much as possible (after
my pods were developed to point where the bar to the left was green) and only
invested in insurance when I had extra resources left right before a potential
shock.</p>

<p><span>One doubt I had
during the game was: is it better to have few well-developed pods or several
basic-level pods in terms of gaining greater resources?  I’m sure that the ambiguity is also
part of the game, but if I were to add something to the game, it would be that
you could have a clearer idea of your return on investment for your choices. Of
course, in real life it is not like this, however there is the empirical
evidence that certain smaller well-developed nations (example: countries in the
European Union) currently are more prosperous than larger emerging countries
(example: BRICS).</span></p>

<p>In this respect, I started to ask myself: How much do natural disasters influence economic prosperity and
development of nations? So I found rankings online for risk of natural
disasters (World Risk Report 2013) and compared them to ranking for economic
development, and I noticed a strong negative correlation between these factors.
The developed nations tend to have a much lower risk of natural disasters
(especially those in Europe and the Middle East), BRICS and developing nations
tend to have moderate levels of risk, and mostly underdeveloped nations (with
exceptions like Japan) tend to have high levels of risk. Of course, this was
more of an observation than a scientific fact, and it would be interesting to validate
this through the use of regressions to figure out just how much historic risk
of natural disasters affect country development today, and how much specific
cases of natural disasters and their respective levels of preparation set back
economic development on a year-to-year or short-term basis.</p><p>Overall,
I think that that the game teaches us some very important lessons in a fun way.
Of course, there has been some criticism in the discussion boards, but one has
to recognize the difficulty of simulating real-world situations with great
detail and that things have to be simplified for the sake of learning and
universal applicability (which the game does very well, by the way, by having this
be set in an “alien” location).</p></div>
