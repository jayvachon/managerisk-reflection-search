    <div class="field-value">Thanks for sharing. A good reflection. It will be good to know which level you eventually completed. It seems like your strategy was quite protective, which is an opposite of mine. I focused on growth and opportunistic researches on the meteorites. I did not buy insurance at all. I spent multiple rounds before I completed level 6. I will be interested to know a protective strategy may or may not help you complete level 6. </div>
