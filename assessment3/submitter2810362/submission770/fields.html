    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">                                                                                               Risk Management<br /><br />The Risk Horizon game has helped me deal with risks better. It thought me how time should be managed. The game helps in making us realize that previous experiences help us better prepare for future risks and disasters. The game helps us think strategical and enhances our skill to handle risk in a more appropriate manner. The game helps us access risks and helps minimize, monitor and try and reduce the probability of risks during natural disasters.I played the game quite a few times to get a hang of it. The first game i just tried to increase the height of the platform of the site but later realized that by continuously trying to raise the platform decreased the building rate of the pods. In the next try i tried just tried to build the pods with out giving much attention to raising the platform. In the second attempt i also insured the buildings so that i don't end up paying an exorbitant amount of money to get the pods re-built and mend the damages. The risk of raising the platform was hampering my building speed and did not help in filling the bar to help me get through to the next level. I feel that i ended spending a lot of money on the insurance, if i had the chance to play the game again i would invest a little less in the insurance and take the odd risk in order to build more pods. Although I should say that studying the comet did not help me in any way, I must say i did not understand the concept of the glowing lights.<br /></div>
