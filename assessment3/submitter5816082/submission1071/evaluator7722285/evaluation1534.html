    <div class="field-value">Very clearly articulated reflection in regards to point one of the assignment. The learning experience is also nicely described and relates to the content of course material. However, the reflection falls short in describing alternative strategies during various attempts (point 2), and does not discuss how you would improve the game to capture the risk management choices that matter in the place you live. </div>
