    <h1>Submission 1746 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5844374, session_user_id: 423cbc85c4c32d9db68d27c87d476634167125e5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management in the game gave an insight to minimizing losses by means of researching each comet and by purchasing adequate insurance. The continuous installation of pods and their improvements ensured a very smooth sailing in the first couple of rounds. However, by the time the third and fourth level was reached, I realized that in the bargain of upgrading my pods and purchasing adequate insurance, I failed to accumulate enough funds to cater for contingencies rising in the form of severe damages to my pods, which also obviously reflected on the slow down of the green lines to the extreme left. Thus, the analysis of preparing against risks also requires more funds was truly experienced. What also happened was the fact that I was left waiting for more funds on numerous occasions to upgrade my pods. Each level of up-gradation gave out a steep climb in the cost factor and It was not immediately in my budget. Thus, I feel that a cost-benefit analysis is highly recommended before venturing into any risk management activities. <br /><br />I did play the game only once. What I would like to do differently is to restrict myself on construction of my pods (acquired max limit in the 2nd level itself) but instead focus on a medium fleet of pods supported by huge sums of money for immediate repairs and replenishment. My critical take away's from the game are, (1) More risk protection requires more funds (2) Risks can only be reduced not eliminated.<br /><br />I personally think that an added tool on cost analysis would be helpful. For example, the research must also state the anticipated losses per pod for a given threat level or severity of impact. The same can help to decide the amount one must invest into Insurance for each individual type of calamity. Also, I do understand that the game has been created with utmost simplicity so that everyone may understand and be an active part of it, however, I feel, that along with the comets. any one more type of risk / shock must also be created for best results under pressure. My experience (nearly 2 years in the field now) tells me that most Risk Management decisions are taken by people under undue amount of stress. I think more realistic outputs may be arrived at.</div>
