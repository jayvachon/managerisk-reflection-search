    <div class="field-value">The key strenght of this reflection was related to providing opinions and explanation at the same time.
This explanation, in the other hand, could be more clear in my opinion: for example I could not clearly understand where I could find the tool my peer would like to implement into the game.
What is more, I would write more about risk management, comparing more its rules to the rules useful to manage the game.
Anyway, it is a very well completed task.</div>
