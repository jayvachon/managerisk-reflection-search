    <h1>Submission 2060 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1382253, session_user_id: b9ec000884e640be8937104fe3c7b85835c1d672)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1-  I spent a lot of time on this game just to accurately define the role of risk management. I noticed that Land wasn't counting as having been visited at one point in one of my games, and I would be developing of its location every time. Anyway, I am enjoying the game and its atmosphere. It was a fantastic experience with tremendous risk game, reliable knowledge, great hospitality. Hence, areas where I feel that the elements of the game or could define the role of risk management are as follows:<br /><ul><li><b>Making money,</b></li><li><b>Fuel efficiency,</b></li><li><b>Movement speed (due to forced grinding),</b></li><li><b>Enhancement Research, and</b></li><li><b>Development Research Centre.</b></li></ul>Firstly, it included the expressions defined risk parameters whereas above average total shareholder returns, risk profiles, investment horizons, long-term sustainable income and temporary capital losses. Risk is a game, of course, making predictions, but let me make one prediction for this year that is guaranteed to be accurate. It is this: you will waste an enormous amount of time reading about, debating and making grand declarations on  financial issues that you cannot possibly predict. Guessing at financial outcomes is unlikely to be good for business. Guessing is not adding value, it is guessing - with inevitable long-term business consequences. The clearly point is that you don't need to combine all of the above problems into one giant cluster bomb of boredom.<br /><br />2-  I played this a lot of time and I have learned that first step in creating an effective risk-management system is to understand the qualitative distinctions among the types of risks that organizations face. On other hand, <span>Strategy risks cannot be managed through a rules-based control model. Instead, you need a risk-management system designed to reduce the probability that the assumed risks actually materialize and to improve the company’s ability to manage or contain the risk events should they occur. </span><span><br /><br />3- </span><span>changing among elements (Making Money, Fuel efficiency, Movement speed, enhancement research and Development research centre ) would greatly increase the playability and replayability of the game. It's got absolutely fantastic potential, but right now it's just making me angry with all the grinding and time wasting, and I'd much rather finish the thing in a few hours and wait for an update than play 40 hours just to pass every stage to see other part of the storyline. </span><br /></div>
