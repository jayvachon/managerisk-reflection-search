    <div class="field-value">Congratulations for your piece of work. Your assignement reflects very clearly your experience throught the game, and  your learning process in risk management. Also, the proposed improvements for a next version are interesting, as it includes taking risks in the process of seeking for a better quality of life. 
To make this reflection a bit better I would suggest a comparation with the main concepts learnt in the course and their description, so I would have rate it higher in the part "comprehension". </div>
