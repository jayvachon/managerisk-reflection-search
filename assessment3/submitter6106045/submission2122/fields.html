    <h1>Submission 2122 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6106045, session_user_id: 45f561bec659bca3475e274319a6b0e6c67f1ecd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game shows how to think strategically in a risk management situation. To win this game, we have to balance between preparing for risk and investing in developing our community. We must achieve balance between the three different tools we have: insurance, research and protection. This balance between development and risk preparation is difficult to reach: investing to much on buildings and development, the community is exposed to comets; investing only in insurance and resilience, you will lack on resources to build pods and the development of the community is slowed down.Â <br /><br />At the beginning, I relied a lot on insurance to protect the communty but this appeared to be a really costly strategy: insurance is expensive and you still have to cover the damages after each comets hit. Puting emphasis and building and protection was much more effective: the protection was sufficient to prevent damages for ordinaries comets. Research on really dangerous comets prevented the community from disasters. <br />This game shows in a simplified way how decision making can be difficult in a risk situation.<br /><br />To better represent risk management choices, I would change the sci-fi scenario for a more real situation: flooding prevention in a coastal area for example.</div>
