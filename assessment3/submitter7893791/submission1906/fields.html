    <h1>Submission 1906 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7893791, session_user_id: d2b49928bdeea8c0ed3c6e5571bb553025d9852e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game, while quite simple, has taught a few important principles in risk management. Firstly, preparation is key. It is always vital to research the factors of danger, which were comets in the game, as well as possible. Making sure to prepare using the information received from research can greatly aid one in preparing a solid and suitable contingency plan. However, research is not infallible, and original forecasts may be well off the mark. By the time you realize that the forecast is off, it may be too late to implement the necessary risk management policies. This occurred a few times in the game, where the severity of a comet may have been judged to be much lower than the actual severity. Unfortunately, I focused on short term gain (rapid development of the pods), rather than establishing a framework in which long term prosperity could be achieved. This event taught me the importance of insurance, where the costs in the event of a disaster are shared and this can prevent a large chunk of money from being suddenly spent. This approach definitely conserves more resources than a short-term one.
Another lesson was that preparation must also be made for low probability events, which may cause severe damage if neglected. One particular incident in the game brought my attention to this point: a comet with an almost filled damage bar had only 2 bars of “chance to hit” filled, but it hit Alora anyway. It caused severe damage and it was very difficult to get back on track. It would have been more frugal for me had I set better protection and invested in insurance. From this game, I learnt that while proactive risk management may cost a large sum in the present, it will set a solid framework for future development.
Further, I also found the approach to spread out developments to be more effective in beating the game. Perhaps this is also true for real life; spreading out developments prevents dualism from occurring in an economy, such as an advanced, rich manufacturing sector and a backwards, poor agricultural sector. As the old adage goes “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. 
One extra feature that could possibly improve the game is the implementation of more risks. The risk management in this game is currently one dimensional and does not represent the multitude of risks a certain economy faces.
