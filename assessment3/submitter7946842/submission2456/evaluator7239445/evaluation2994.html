    <div class="field-value">Key Strength:
Thoughts are extremely well-articulated and there are always references to developmental challenges posed by risks; a very cohesive, structured narrative.

What could have been better?
The protection aspect is not well described in terms of need to elevate the land so as to avoid the tide even though accurate references are made to insurance and knowledge. Additionally, community ties and their ability to serve as a coping mechanism in the face of disaster was not well-explained. I would have also liked a better suggestion on what could have been improved or done differently within the game.

Final comments:
In general, I found the arguments logical and well laid-out.</div>
