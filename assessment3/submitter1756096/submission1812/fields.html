    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Reflection on Risk Horizon game</p>

<p>The game illustrates risk management in a hypothetical
world. The player has to manage his resources to invest in development and in
providing resilience to his community. In addition to development, the player
can invest in protection by raising level (to increase resilience against
meteor hits) and in making insurance. Such actions will deprive direct
development from some immediately existing financial resources, but would pay
off in the future case of meteorite hits by reducing the resulting damage and rebuilding
cost. In addition, investment in research and networking will help in making
better decisions about the balance between development and resilience building.</p>

<p>I played the game few times. My first run was important in
developing my strategy to reach higher levels. Eventually I managed to reach
level 4. My first run was not very successful. What I learned, was that a
balance between investment in development and in building resilience (insurance
and level rising) must be made. That should be based on available data and
information to maximize the overall expected outcome. It is important to have
that balance that is updated continuously based on available information in terms
of the expected risks associated with the game in terms of meteor hit strength
and probability of hit. Ignoring resilience will increase production but it
will be severely hit by first disaster which would risk the whole development
investments. On the other hand, investing too much building resilience in insurance
and level raising will limit development activities because of low resources
allocated for development. Reaching an optimum balance is the key factor in
progressing in this game and reaching higher levels.</p>

<p>The game is very simple compared to real life risk
management issues. However, it captures basic ideas and trade-offs in a very
smooth way. But of course some thoughts exist to add more features that capture
more risk management choices. In this aspect I would suggest adding training to
each building inhabitants. Training would cost some money, but would lower
damages in case of disasters. At each later stage training effect is reduced
unless a refresh training or drill is carried out, of course at a lower cost of
initial training. That can be done for each facility independent of others.</p></div>
