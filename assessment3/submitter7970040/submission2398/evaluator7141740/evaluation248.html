    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is  the risk management process. The struggle between balancing the options being taken to manage risk. One thing to make this reflection better is the realization of BALANCE and knowing that all components of risk management must be proportionally distributed because no project is more important than the other. But knowing how to focus on all of these without being distracted is key. For instance, adequate research is carried out to know the severity of the disaster, then focus on creating knowledge, protection to community and insurance as well as development in order to lessen upgrading when disaster finally occurs. </div>
