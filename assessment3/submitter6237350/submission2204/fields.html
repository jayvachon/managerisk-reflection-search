    <h1>Submission 2204 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6237350, session_user_id: 94aa7986a17e05638e65ad516dc769f4f3d9c9e2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was to prepare for impending damage, suffering or loss. Further, it helped to properly manage the damage, suffering, and loss due to unseen or foreseen events. Knowledge was useful when advancing to the next round because it helped to make key decisions in choosing insurance over elevation of the island or conducting research to further gain protection against an asteroid hit. So, I mostly relied on insurance and knowledge to advance through the game. Protection by elevation of the island was time consuming and easily lost if there was significant damage from an asteroid hit. Plus, research I feel provided a better option for protection. Preparation for risk helped to rebuild in reasonable amount of time due to the level of advancement of the colony. The more moderate homes were cheaper and took less time to rebuild compared to the more advance ones. However, the greater the development of the colony the more points and options I was able to gain in order to advance to the next round. So, that was a trade off as well I think in playing the game. <br /><br />It took me numerous tries to advance to second level and beyond each time learning more about the game until I was able develop a routine to ensure advancement and quickly repair my colony. I found that purchasing insurance right away and building a few homes was valuable to continue playing the game. Mainly, what I learned from the game is that there is no full proof protection plan that will ward off any type of risk. Risk or calamity is very real and part of our lives everyday so its important to consciously realize that and not ignore it. I think its more dangerous to believe that an individual can somewhat predict the level of risk that on may be subject and therefore not adequately prepared for it.<br /><br />I would implement an evacuation plan to the risk management plan. I feel that losing loved ones has a longer effect on an individual than losing possessions. Material possessions can replaced and rebuilt but losing someone that hurts more and that same sentiment should a priority and responsibility of the governing body. Urging people to leave when the risk to great is important especially if there are systems in place to effectively plan for such impending events that have the ability to cause much damage. </div>
