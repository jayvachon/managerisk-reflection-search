    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>HELLO everybody, I'm William from China. Now I wanna talk about my recommandation of tjis game.</div><div>This little game was shows about risk management, there were three factors in this game- technology, protection and insurance. In the game, risk management was a prevent thinking, when you playing this game, you must plan how to spent your money and time well, if you spent too much time on developing technology, when the comets hitting coming, you would have no enough protection, and you need to spend more money on repair the pods, and the repairing would also cost time and would delay your next level development. So when I was playing this game, I spent a lot of time to enhance protection, and keep it at least 3 blues, but Ifound if I wanna reduce the damage from comets hitting on the lowest level, I must ensure the protection bar no less than the comets' severity, then I could get the most "NO DAMAGE", or else, I must confront many times nocertainly damage. Indeed, I played severl times to find it.</div><div>At the first time I played the game, a mistake I did was saved too muchmoney, not spent it efficiently, infact, money can not get any gain if the money only put in pocket, so when I played the game again, I saved no money at the first two levels, then I can get the fastest develop speed. </div><div>Technology. Technology is the most important thing in this game, it gives money and power source of protection. But please be noticed, pods need more repairation fee in high level, so if you developed too fast without enough protection, you would break the balance and fail. </div><div>Insurance. At the first two levels, I bought no insurance, because I could use the protection to prevent damage only, and the cost of insurance would occupy a lot of money, moreover, if the damage occured, the repairation cost would not too expensive because of the high level protection. So, I started to purchase insurance from level 3, because at that time the repairation fee was very expensive and would use a lot of time if you didn't buy insurance. And I think, insurance is an AFTERWARD ACTION, but prevent action is the most important. </div><div>If let me update the game, may be I will add more protection tools, so users could have more choice to protect the pods.</div><div>That's what I thought after played this game.</div><div>And, because my laptop was broken, I typed all words via my andriod phone, and unfortunately, just one hour before I started to type the words, I dropped my glasses in the sea when I was swimming in the sea, and here has no glasses shop, so I have to type them by my 700 degrees myopia eyes.  Maybe it's a failure risk management.</div><div> And my English is not good enough, so please fell free and kindly correct my mistakes. Thank you.</div></div>
