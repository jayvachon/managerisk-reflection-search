    <h1>Submission 101 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5706809, session_user_id: 2047b4d7aeaae36f0ac878279904c570d9ff688d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Answer 1:</b></p><p><b>Risk management</b></p><p><strong>Goal</strong>: sustainable development rate </p><p><b>Risk Chain</b></p><p><b>Shocks</b> – comets</p><p><b>External environment</b>
– Alora</p><p><b>Internal conditions</b>
- time and cash constraint, managing protection, insurance and research</p><p><b>Outcome</b> - development
bar</p><p><b>The previous stocks
affect protection and skill to manage them so feedback loop is there.</b></p><p><b>Preparation</b> means
efforts before the shocks.</p><p><b>Knowledge</b> means
research which gives higher time to build community support. <b>Protection</b> means increasing the height.
Protection mitigates impairment in growth after shocks. <b>Insurance</b> is to take cover. </p><p><b>Coping</b> involves
efforts after the shocks have occurred. This may involve building community
support, as the risk is systematic and repairing the damaged pods.</p><p><b>Obstacles</b>: only
resource constraint. </p><p>To <b>overcome the
obstacles</b>: use community support in coping mechanism and manage cash and
time.</p><p> </p><p><b>Knowledge, Protection
and Insurance -- Choice and trade off</b></p><p>Defer the insurance as far as I can to improve liquidity or
use money in some productive work. Insurance can be purchased immediately. But
I make sure that before any comet hit, I have insurance.</p><p>For knowledge and protection there is a <b>real trade off</b>. Because either one can be improved at a time. Both
must to be managed and it’s a challenge. </p><p> </p><p><b>Effects on growth</b></p><p>Though protection slowdown growth and costs more than
knowledge it’s important because it will reduce impairment significantly after
comet hit. Knowledge doesn't slowdown the development rate and less costly. But
if damage occurs it will be huge damage without protection and development will
suffer.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Answer 2:</strong></p><p><b>I have first defined variables
after my first attempt</b>. </p><p>Cash, Comets: Severity, Chances of hit, Research, Pods: Upgrades,
Development bar, Protection, Insurance: Cover, Community support.</p><p> </p><p><b>Leanings:</b></p><p>Upgrade pods with either protection or research activity to
make efficient use of time, as they can be parallel.</p><p>Defer insurance as it will improve liquidity, but take
before first hit.</p><p>At the end of stage keep sufficient cash to meet immediate expense
like insurance in the next level. </p><p>Sufficient protection and research is more preferable than
just upgrading pods to have sustainable growth.</p><p>Manage cash at proper level. Excess cash is of no use.</p><p>Observe development bar </p><p>Green increase protection or research</p><p>Yellow increase pods or upgrade them</p><p>Red danger, repair</p><p>Prioritize comets based on the severity, chances of hit and
speed.</p><p> </p><p> <strong>Answer 3:</strong></p><p><b>Changes in game</b></p><p><b>Parallel protection and research</b></p><p>Because we need both and due to their serialized nature it’s
difficult to manage time constraint. </p><p>In reality we can do both the things like gaining the knowledge and improve protection. Managing cash is a real world constraint but having cash means resources it should be allowed to have both research and protection simultaneously.</p><p><b>Restart Policy</b></p><p>















































































</p><p>After game over, give choice to start from that level or beginning. </p></div>
