    <div class="field-value">It appears you played the game, and as you said had trouble understanding what you were to do.  At first I had trouble understanding the game, but after playing it many times, I finally understood what I thought I needed to do to achieve the best results.  Again to get to that point I played the game over a dozen times.  I think if you would have played the game several more times you would have understood it better.</div>
