    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Reflections from the Risk Horizon game.</strong></p>

<p>Â </p>

<p>Risk Horizon game is a hard game as life itself is also.</p>

<p>My first lesson is was that without having an insurance it is very
difficult to win at the game (and I remembered that is the case in life also).</p>

<p>And then it came the issue about events that were to happen and that I
needed to have information on these events. There were events that I could not
do nothing to stop then but I could use knowledge about these events to handle
in the best way possible consequences.</p>

<p>The issue of resources was also crucial. For to play the game you need
resources (all the time you need resources) and everyone of your actions
implies to stop receiving or spending resources without which it is impossible
to achieve development or managing the consequences of unwanted events.</p>

<p>And as always, the time factor is present. There is a limited time to
make decisions and are taken during that time or not, always something happens.</p>

<p>What
was the role of risk management in the game? Playing this game you are always
at risk management. Every secong.</p>

<p>I
you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first
time? What were the main things you learned from the game? I do not use
insurance at the beginning. Only after playing again, again I understood how
important that issue was.</p>

<p><span>Imagine
you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change
or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the
risk management choices that matter in the place you live? The game needs
urgently a help function. At a game, as in life, you cannot play properly if
you do not know quite well how you have to play.</span></p></div>
