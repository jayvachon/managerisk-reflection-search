    <div class="field-value">The author structured his answers very well. He/she made his choices very clear. I also liked his/her proposed change, to add other types of buildings, that are relevant for growth, not just houses. 
I understood, that he/she placed the game rather successfully and reached at least level 4. As I did not manage that, I would be very keen to get to know in detail just how he/she managed that. I would also like to read more about how he/she used the information from research for the success of the game. Overall a good piece of work. And don't worry about your English. ; )</div>
