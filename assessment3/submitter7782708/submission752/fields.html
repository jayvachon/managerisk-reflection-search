    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk horizon game gave me an well understanding based on risk management through meteors attack and defense. I think that the message tried to give to audience from this game is relied on 3 tiers. First and the most fundamental one is being prepared everytime for an unexpected event. Because the pace of meteors were different from each other, thus if you didnt get prepared yourself to hit you could get damage. The other key message was related with the researching of each meteors. although at the beginning of the meteor appeared on the screen, their severeness was seemed little, however after making research about it its severeness increased when when it hitted, its damage was tremendous. By taking into consideration this point, i would say that making research is crucial unless you think that you are well prepared to unexpected risks. Last but not least point is after one meteors hit your land, your lands level decreases. It means that even you feel like you are well prepared for future risks, you should check your status after an unexpected event lived. For aforementioned reasons, this game learnt me the importance of research for risks, being prepared for everytime and also making ex-ante and post-ante analysis for risk events.Â </div>
