    <h1>Submission 1186 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5548160, session_user_id: 0c17a63165bc7491b26b35e1f3e99ac408e844dd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management in this game is to protect the community from the damage caused by comets and flood by reducing the most possible damage. I bought insurance and do research for each comets while building communities. Well prepared strategy reduces immediately the severity of damage and cost of reconstruction.<br /><br />I played several but could not pass to level 4 unfortunately. The first time , I built as many as communities as I could with little upgrade. It costed me much more for cost of reconstruction and lower my chance to pass the level. Hence, I tried to build one very high level community with 3 other less upgraded surrounding. Insurance although high did help a lot regarding to the cost of fixation, money paid for insurance in general is much less than the total cost of damage. Researching spent for risk (comets) is worth since it reduces the severity of damage which lead to cheaper and less time for communities building (cost and time loss for prepare the damage was minimised)<br /><br />I would like to add the methods of risk prevention which can lower the chance of hit as well, since research only reduces the severity. Actually, it can cost less than the fixation amount, and shows more options in term of risk management.Â </div>
