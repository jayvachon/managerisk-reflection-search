    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection was the relationship between any decision taken during the game and risk management. I think that to better deal with risk management is to find the optimal balance between the different kinds of risk: catastrophic risk, liquidity risk, growing risk, protection risk, insurance risks, etc. that it is not easy and simple, like in the game. </div>
