    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><strong>The game was worthwile in that it really broaden my knowledge of  my understanding of the course. The game thought me a practical way of managing risk weather position or in a situation to take any decision. The risk management techniques in the game helped to achieve what I will describe as sustainable development in the development and progress of the game, it also helped to maintain a stable environment and infrastructural development especially when they are strengthened to withstand adverse conditions. Risk management in the aspect of insurance cover helps to reduced the fear of loss especially when the severity of hit by the meteors are high.</strong></div><div><strong>If I were to play the game again after playing it once, I will be mindful of the timing in the game. Knowing that in reality, time waits for no man </strong></div><div><strong>I was mindful of the king of insurance I took after the first trial and I learnt that when you have a hand full of information as regards any risk that may be involved at any given time, you tend to be more prepared. However, if there is insurance cover, you will not be afraid to keep going and you probably will think less of the possibility of any loss.</strong></div><div><strong>If I were to add one thing to the game, I will make the water part of the game to over flood the land </strong></div><div><strong>I will make drainages which if not constructed will course the city to gradually colarpse from the flood</strong></div><div><strong>In my place I will propose good road and drainage construction to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live </strong></div><div><br /></div></div>
