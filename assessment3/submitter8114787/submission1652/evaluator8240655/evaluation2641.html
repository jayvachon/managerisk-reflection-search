    <div class="field-value">I like how the participant structures his/her reflection.  It clearly detailed out how he/she tried to implement risk management in different ways and was not able to reach.  It is an honest reflection to show that how the course does not necessary reflect what is happening in the reality, at least in the game reality.  Besides the writing style, I thought the participant did provide a comprehensive reflection of his/her experience with the game.</div>
