    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>In Risk Horizon, the player uses risk management to identify and assess the probability of damage from a comet strike and use resources (time and money) to help minimise the consequent negative effects. The player has several methods of protecting development the best use of which depends on the comet's severity, chance of impact and speed. <br /><br />When I played, I would look at a comet's speed first, then its severity and lastly its chance of impact. I prioritised fast comets, looking at their statistics almost immediately. For a severity that was greater than the height of my land I bought insurance as there was no time to research and use community connections (a cheaper method that allows money to be invested in upgrades). However, for slow and high severity comets with at least a 20% chance of hitting I chose to save money on insurance (assuming I hadn't already bought it) by researching it and using community connections to minimise or negate its damage. However, carrying out research is time consuming; you may still detriment development through neglect. Above level two in the game, I tried to keep my land 3 units above the norm as the community is protected against low severity comets and my resources can be used more effectively elsewhere.
Using Insurance to prepare for risk is useful in the later levels as it helps you afford expensive repairs, quickly recovering your previous development levels and also development you missed out on during repairs. This protection is effective for a long time â€“ the duration of a level. Using research and community connections is more risky, but can yield high rewards (complete negation of a comet's effect on development). It is effective immediately, and its effectiveness varies between each comet. 

<br /><br />I played the game twice, the second time I made a point of only buying insurance when faced with high risk comets of severity greater than 6 (my maximum level of protection provided by community connections with maximum research), instead of simply buying it at the start of each level. While this strategy is more risky, it allowed me to spend more on upgrades and achieve a high enough rate of development to complete each level. 

I learned that I have to take risks, diverting money from protection (insurance and ground raising) to upgrades to achieve rate of development high enough to complete the last level. I had to use time very efficiently to maximise use of community connections in the place of insurance. In other words, we may have to take large risks to obtain the largest rewards.

To make the new game better represent the risk management choices made in Glasgow, the area I live in, I would change the threat from comets to the threat from crime, particularly damage to a community's businesses that cause job losses and therefore slower development. The player can still take out insurance against damage, and use research and community connections to protect the local economy</span></div>
