    <div class="field-value">A key strength in the reflection is writer's understanding of the risk management and his/her awareness of the practical implications of the risk management on his/country. He/She successfully succeeded to always give real life examples from the background he came from.

I however find it a kind of uneasy to link the writing to the questions in a precise manner. Furthermore, there was no real analogy between what was experienced during the game and what is written here. I think it can be attributed to linguistic barriers more than to comprehension barriers this is why I gave this score  </div>
