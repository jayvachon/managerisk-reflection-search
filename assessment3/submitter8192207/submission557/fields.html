    <h1>Submission 557 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8192207, session_user_id: a03e611963b1bd4af4bbb28604d5138ecfc36a91)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I found
the game quit interesting showing the different elements the decision maker
should balance in order to achieve prosperity to his community. In the game you
are Luminator of Alora who was chosen to develop Alora community, accordingly
you have the full authority to allocate all the resources in the direction you believe
will achieve the required development <b><u>(opportunity )</u></b>  but Unfortunately  the Alora world is showered by  comets which could lead to tsunami able
to destroy your community <b><u>(risk)</u></b>  . in this game scenario we see a perfect situation
to apply the Risk management  which is by
definition the process that involves confronting risks, preparing for them and
coping with their effects . the game give you all the risk management <i><span>components
( knowledge throw research , protection throw leveling the island up   , Insurance</span></i>  , and
coping throw repair ) . what I found very interesting was that you had to do tradeoff
between the protection and development, and although I knew that investing in
the protection is right choice I was driven more by the development index and I
think this is partly because the protection effort is a long time investment and
you can't see its benefit immediately and so the game made it very boring
to be acquired and made it hinder the progress index as per the common
understanding . still after losing to the game I thought that should I raised
the island it would mitigate a lot of the tsunami effect and I would save a lot
of time waste in the repair and a its cost but this show me what the report
mean by The obstacles to risk management<b> . </b>should I play the game another time I would
concentrate on achieving the perfect balance between the development and the
protection  and start the protection from
the start of the game as my pervious trials proved that the more advanced community
is the more it  suffer if it isn't properly
protected against the risk.Still in real life I think that the protection
effort will not hinder the development as in the game and both can be done in Parallel
with good awareness .</p>

<p>If I was
tasked with developing a new version of the game I would add another risk like
a volcano of earthquake and I would add citizen in the city needed to be
rescued after the crises beside that I would make a risk not only imposed on
the player as natural crisis by also taken by his choice as investing with
wrong company during the development   </p></div>
