    <div class="field-value">I must say that the student tried to make a very clear description of the game and his experience how he deals with situation in order to impose better risk management options. Concept of borrow fund is a good option.
 But the reflection is bit descriptive. It would have been better if the student could more focused on the learning of the game rather than explaining the whole game how he has played. </div>
