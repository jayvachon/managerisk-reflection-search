    <div class="field-value">This reflection captures well the experience of role-playing a risk manager. Some corrections on the meaning of preparation tools (knowledge, insurance and protection) are needed. Highlighting the trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection, and insurance, and how did you alter their contribution to managing the risk as you played additional rounds would potentially improve the reflection.</div>
