    <h1>Submission 809 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7166484, session_user_id: ff0aed2759d61c1a6c7ca5251e0d1063dbface23)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At first game I tried to be cautious
and pay for insurance and protection that could helped me until level four. I
win at my second attempt and I tried to pay attention to all aspects , develop
as fast as I can while I was trying to observe comets and my defense strategy .</p>

<p>I tried to focus on
emergencies and high level risks. After the first level of pods I tried to
upgrade the protection to a reasonable level appropriate to level of the game ,
and if I would a face with high level risk , I would’ve bought an insurance.</p>

<p>In my opinion we shouldn’t let the
disasters to ruin our community and then try to fix it . I know that it depends
on money and resources but insurance is my last policy. We should be in a
reasonable place when something bad happens. For example , knowledge is very
important for me, if you know the average frequency of earthquakes in a region
, or the season that may have floods , storm or so on , you can be more
prepared and your investment would be more efficient. If you want to prepare
for all time and stay alert it will harm your development and cost you a huge
amount of money.</p>

<p>I learned that at first I should
study on the risks and specify their priority and then try to make a decision that
is adequate . research will cost you, but its much less than what you want to
spend if it isn’t necessary to a certain risk. And if you spend that amount of
money sooner than its time it will harm your development . and the next factor
is community connections that is very similar to warnings that happened in Bangeladesh
before floods and make people to stay alert , it is also should be in
appropriate way that is very related to the chance of happening and the severity
of risks, that if you do more than what is necessary it will be an unnecessary chaos
. </p>

<p><span>In this game we  , players , were like governments that should
be aware of  all the risks and also
control the development . when you spend money for protection more than what you
need it will reduce your development speed , even if you wanted to upgrade
later you should do the protection later because if you invest that money on
the pods you can earn more money , I want to say that you should calculate and
be aware of the time and money and the risks then do what you want to do . also
if you do it less than what you want it will cost you a lot of money for
repairing the buildings , even if you have insurance. </span></p>

<p><span>In place that I live people don’t pay
attention to risks that might happen . they will prefer other things to
insurance and protection and even knowledge. In my opinion the most valuable
thing is incitement in my country , and sometimes obligation ! because they don’t
know the exact amount of danger in risks . At first you should tell them about
what is going to happen and what will they have to confront if something happens
( information ) , then try to improve incitements and help them to learn how to
confront with risks ( incitements ) after that you have to move steady to
change their lifestyle to away that it become the community ’s demand and they
try to learn it themselves ( behavior ) . At the end most of the times it is
the governments task to help people in gaining resources and education . </span></p></div>
