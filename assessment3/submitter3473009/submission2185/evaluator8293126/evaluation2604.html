    <div class="field-value">The assignment starts with demonstrating risk as the balance of threats and opportunities. After that, it clarifies the player's experience by comparing the two times of playing game, but the conclusion of the comparison is poor. The suggestion of changing insurance could be useless because the game could become more complicated, leading to a challenging game instead of an educating game. Nonetheless, it attempts to explore the game in detail rather than to discover deeply the lesson learned from this virtual game. There are two main recommendations to improve this reflection assignment. First of all, the author should play this game more times and focus on understanding the risks and how to cope with the risks rather than only enjoying the game.The other one could be writing in an academic style with no spelling fault and in third-person perspective to limit the subjectivity.</div>
