    <h1>Submission 1805 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3013867, session_user_id: 738adb811dd459d256a4ee8f3938117aa7a493f1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game is a wonderful reflection of demonstrations address the risks, because they do not learn the skills of comets, we can not reduce the risk of collision with the ground, rather than building new stations, we do not have money to repair and raise the level. Simplicity, my English is weak, and there is almost no time :) (late register for courses)</div>
