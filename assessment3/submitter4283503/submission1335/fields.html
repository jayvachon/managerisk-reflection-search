    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Reflections Risk Horizon Game<br /><br />the role of risk management was to anticipate and to reduce the damage by an occurring risk. You could to this by<br /><ul><li>taking insurance</li><li>create bonds</li><li>build on a higher ground</li><li>protecting to reduce damage</li><li>in case of damage repair as soon as possible</li><li> of a risk and to manage the damage by insurance , bonds or to build on a higher level.<br /></li></ul>I started the game with ( the highest) insurance(on higher levels i discovered that i couldn't reach a higher level by to much damage). To build as much as possible and at the same time get knowledge  of the comets (risks), Furthermore to bring the land on an higher level to decrease the risk and in case of an event reduce the damage. I learned later that on the first level you don't have to put much emphasis on insurance until there is high risk.  Getting information about the level of the risk of the comets.<br /><br />My tactic was to get insurance build as much as possible creating connections. For the higher levels <br /><br />The changes that i would consider is already applied. I live in a polder (thus on a seabed) Its very importantly to protect us against the water. So we have to have good dikes. I think the raising of the land already captures this. it would be double or unnecessary to also apply dikes.</div>
