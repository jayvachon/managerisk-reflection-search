    <div class="field-value">The reflection was very clear and well thought out, adding the governmental aspect to the game would be quite a challenge. Governments tend to create risk in their own right due to the illusion that they will take care of the individual in a catastrophic disaster. In my humble opinion, the only way to add it in the game would be to make it a chance aspect like rolling the dice or spin the wheel to see what they actually do. Overall great job!</div>
