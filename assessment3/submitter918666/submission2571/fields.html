    <h1>Submission 2571 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 918666, session_user_id: 18923eb87585412eb8119684c616cca1e529d9ed)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game a couple of times and interestingly got so caught up in the intellectual exercise of it that I am writing this with only a few minutes left to the deadline. It reminds me that it is important to keep in mind all the real world consequences of our decision making. As a development practitioner it is very easy to get too caught up in the intellectual exercise of "the game" without thinking about actual impact on lives. I'm not saying the abstract is unimportant it's just important to get that balance right. <br /><br />The first time I played the game I maxed out on insurance coverage every time which allowed me to develop and protect the development of the pods up to a certain point. All of my pods developed to a a level three of four until the funds for developing them further ran out. The second time I played the game I over corrected and didn't buy insurance in the early rounds preferring to rely on research and some high water protection to protect the pods. Again this worked well until a certain level when all of my pods became heavily damaged and there was not enough funds left to repair them in time to meet the development goals. <br /><br />The main thing that I have learned from the game is the level of complexity involved in making these simple decisions. There are only a few variables in the game at the moment and it is still complex to manage get the balance right. The other thing I learnt is that it is important to be always doing something in risk management. In spite of myself I sometimes found myself buying insurance, building up protection and then sitting back and watching to see how it all unfolds rather than remembering to  continue the research process. <br /><br />If I were developing a new version of the game I would try to add some sort of representation of democracy or the governance process into the mix. I'm not entirely sure how yo would do this, maybe introduce a citizen satisfaction meter which would drop if you failed to mitigate a major disaster or spent too little on development. If it dropped below a certain point you would be thrown out of office or there would be a revolution. <br /></div>
