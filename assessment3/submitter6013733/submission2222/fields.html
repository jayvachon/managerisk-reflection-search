    <h1>Submission 2222 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6013733, session_user_id: 9ad4ead4b951869700f89e7ec674772474bcbc26)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is critical to the game. Without managing risk, through the purchase of insurance, natural disasters would have destroyed the village and it would be impossible to rebuild quickly. In the beginning but I did not buy insurance, felt I could not afford it.  I found this to be a reflection of my own economic situation.  I began to think that at some point the village would be negatively impacted so to protect the investment I purchased insurance. Investing in construction in the village , while purchasing insurance of various amounts,allowed me  to receive benefits while protecting holdings.<br /> I was able to become aware of the limitations of my own thinking patterns.  It affirmed what I learned in the videos of risk perception, personal denial that it can happen to me and that insurance costs were perceived as too high.I did find that some insurance is better than no insurance. Hedging the investment against disaster works as long as the insurer is reputable.Trust is a major issue and must be addressed in incremental steps, there must be some monitoring of the issuers of policies in countries that do not have good fiscal oversight or policies of regulation.Countries committed to infrastructure development addressing specific needs, such as water shelters in Bangladesh, also require political stability.Community based interventions can be very effective when organized to reduce disaster damage and loss of life.  Populations that are marginalized often do not have the alternative to relocate and are allocated the most problematic development zones.<br />The version of the game that I would develop, would offer multiple disasters that may or may not affect the village.  For example, a change of the terrain would alter flood destruction, an existing water course might be diverted with success,or drainage fields to stop water erosion.<br /></div>
