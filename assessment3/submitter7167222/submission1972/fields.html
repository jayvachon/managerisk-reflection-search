    <h1>Submission 1972 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7167222, session_user_id: b84c8300f1d3fea60ec0b930dab856e6d41e5093)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I was only able to play a few times before the program froze, but I quickly saw that risk management was essentially a cost-benefit analysis of which choices provide the greatest reward in a way that mitigates risk while leaving the maximum amount of resources for development. Through trial-and-error, not any wisdom on my part, I ultimately chose to focus primarily on research and protection because, again, they helped prepare/prevent risk in the most resource ($) effective way. This was moderately successful, and I did purchase insurance and obviously repair any damaged structures. But in this particular game, I found that-for me-preventing and preparing through research was more effective than simply purchasing expensive insurance. However, in my case, I found it difficult to immediately expand development while preparing for risk at the same time (this is after I already built my pods and made my initial development). This was my primary problem.<br /><br />As I said, I only played a few times before the software went haywire, but I significantly increased my investment in research in comparison to insurance each time. I don't know how sustainable and truly effective this was, but it was cheaper than buying insurance and seemed to lessen the frequency and damage of the comets that struck me. One thing that I did not do, and would experiment with in hindsight, was leave any money left over or save much of my funds for strengthening the pods or buildings new ones. (I would start out with the maximum number possible). If I was to play again, I would see if it's possible to conserve some of your resources and invest in actual development rather than focus almost entirely on risk protection at the expense of anything else. The main thing that I took away was the difficulty that comes with having a finite amount of resources and time and an unlimited number of potential risks. It would take a real "balancing act" to diversify and wisely use your funding or resources to both spark development while preparing for and protecting against risk. Similarly, on the risk management side alone (pretend no development was taking place), it is less straightforward than it seems when trying to determine which choices are most important and should be utilized more the others (although not at the expense of the other actions of course.)<br /><br />I have an emphatic suggestion about how to make the game better, and it doesn't (necessarily) have anything to do with pods, research, insurance, and protection against comets. I think that it would be extremely valuable if the game could be adapted to a real-life scenario (or six real-life scenarios instead of six levels, etc.). I know that this exercise allowed for simplification, but I think it would be much, much more useful and helpful if applied in some hypothetical, oversimplified real-life examples. I think that doing so is very possible, and all of us would take away much more than from the current model. I know that this isn't the simple change that the question-writer probably had in mind, but I think most would agree with me that a real-world hypothetical situation with all complicating variables taken away would make much more of an imprint and stimulate thought about this subject than building pods and managing the risk posed by comets.<br /></div>
