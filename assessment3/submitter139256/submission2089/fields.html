    <h1>Submission 2089 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 139256, session_user_id: 1dfb5cb164a2f67690fdb94e3c48460fd9e8f2b7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The essay is a reflection on the learning outcomes from the
game “Risk Horizon” and I will discuss some key aspects I learned from the
game. The game is basically about building and developing a community Alora on
an empty coast land.</p>

<p>The major risk Alora regularly faces is the fall of comets
from the sky. The most important test in this situation is to keep up the
development and also taking protective measures by raising the level of the
Alora’s land. The option of arranging insurance in case of the worst case
scenario is also available and also an important tool of risk management “Research”
or knowledge is there as well which helps in assessing and gauging the risk to
assign appropriate resources but keeping development goals in mind.</p>

<p> There are always
tradeoffs of choosing different options which are also an important part of
this game. If we put all our efforts in protection then we will lose time and financial
resources for development, research and insurance. Similarly, if research says
risk in foreseeable future is not that high in terms of chances and severity
then there is less sense to put more resources towards insurance. </p>

<p>Also, another important aspect I learned is the importance
of keeping up the reasonable pace of development.  We cannot keep developing without ignoring our
risks but at the same time our main goal is development and risk management is
there to protect against losses to the development we have achieved or will
achieve in foreseeable future.</p>

<p>When first time I played the game, I lost it as my main
focus was on insurance and protection by raising level. This left me behind the
goal of developing Alora which is why I was playing the game. Then I learned
the importance of keeping up the development and not going for “over kill” in
terms of protection and insurance. To keep the protection and insurance in the
right limits, research on comet risks played a key role.</p>

<p>If I am tasked with developing a new version then I will include
is the option of building under-ground bunkers to protect the community. Bunkers
in disaster times can work as safety homes but in normal times will be used for
other purposes like under-ground parking or storage houses for food and
commercial products. Some investment on research will help us know about the
danger in advance as well so we can adequate arrangements.</p>

<p>The other option (a bit ambitious one) which I would like to
include is the option of using current space, missile and nuclear technologies
to shoot down the comets. This will have enormous cost initially but will also
give an option to reduce insurance, protection and repair or redevelopment costs.
Alora can share the cost with other communities to build such systems. This
will require some option to introduce advocacy for joint efforts as well. We
also need to keep in mind that more than 10 countries have decent space and
missile programs which can help in achieving the goal of protecting lives
instead of creating dangers for humanity. It is always a better choice to use
our technological, financial and human resources for protecting humanity instead
of destroying it.</p></div>
