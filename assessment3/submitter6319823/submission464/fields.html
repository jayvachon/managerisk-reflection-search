    <h1>Submission 464 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6319823, session_user_id: 4e8119ef1a58ca1ca53811fed139ca298823b6a1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management in the game helps you safe guard your buildings by monitoring the comets, buying insurance and also doing some research on the the severity and damage levels of the comet. I had to buy a level 3 insurance to be safe guard my assets. I also raised the level of my village to be on the same level of the chances of the comet damage.  The knowledge gained was the monitoring of the speed of the comet as well as the severity and chances of a hit. The insurance helped in offsetting the damage done by the comet<br /><br />Playing the game once, i failed on the first level as i didn't quite grasp the game immediately even after going through the tutorial but as i played it again, i had a better understanding and saw where i failed in the game. Managing risk effecting by identifying the risk within my environment (comet),researching the comet, putting the risk mitigation resources (insurance and raising my village in accordance with the level of the comet) and also monitoring the speed of the comets.<br /><br />I found out that even though i was well covered and when a comet stroke my village was not damaged but I still managed to fail and I couldn't quite understand why and how that happened. I would make it clearer for the user by giving hints to help them better protect their village as it wasn't very clear to me. I managed to get to level 4 but couldn't quite make it further to level 5.<br /></div>
