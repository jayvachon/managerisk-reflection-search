    <h1>Submission 605 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8036156, session_user_id: a783c8d68912ed504291904245db44a0808b0dce)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">      The role of risk management in this game was to succesfully build a colony or communty at the same time prepare and execute a plan against the risk of comets hitting the community. This role led to balancing use of insurance ,protection and research  which if balanced correctly you advanced. The trade offs and some of the sacrfices were that you had to choose between either knowledge our spend money on protection .This depended on how severe the comet  was and what the chance of hitting was high or not. Sometimes you had sacrfice money for protection and buy insurance in order to save the pods for it would cost more in damages. I noticed the more pods you had it seemed like the comets missed more often. In preparation for risk I saw immediate and long term results. Some immediate ones were that buying protection I was prepared ahead of the comet hitting and then saw that after the comet hit there was no or little damage to the pods.and the cost to repair was minimal. So I understood with knowledge prior and a plan I was able to move onto the next level.<br /><br />  If I played Risk Horizon only once and were to play again I wolud use protection for in the first I didn't understand that the was the way to prevent comets from damaging the pods. Also I would update pods early on because it would allow me to reach the goal faster before time was up. If I were to play the the game mopre then once what I wolud do the next game is balance the development and protection and insurance. The main points that I learned from this game is that with the knowledge ,plan and, insurance balanced you would be successful in this game and other situations in life.<br /> <br />   Some aspects of risk management that I would add to Risk Horizon is that some other being warning the community of pods of a comet and that would give advice like a developed goverment would do in such calamities. I wolud also add insurance to be one hundrerd percent covered to relieve such burdens. A change that I would pitch that would better represent risk management choises in different locations  is to be aware of the risk while having a plan that is ready to be executed at any given time. Be prepared early on before it strikes with improved knowledge. An example is if I were to live in tornado prone area I would have to prepare first by finding secure safe location whether it is a home I purchased accordingly or safe home. Second keep vital supplies handy for a least a couple of days. That would be key to success in risk management.</div>
