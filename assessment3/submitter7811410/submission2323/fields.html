    <h1>Submission 2323 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7811410, session_user_id: da5c1a409c562af2a27a27044f29a3672c035d9b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of Risk Management in the game was obvious: the
essence of the game is taking risks (which will preserve the existence of Alora
and also to take on opportunities for its development); preparing for these risks
and also putting in place mechanisms to cope with them. The internal conditions
of Alora (such as its different stages of development and the ability of the
community to interact after experiencing shocks) and the external environment
are all put into consideration when coping with these risks. The community is
expected to prepare by acquiring knowledge concerning the comet it is anticipating,
obtain insurance and also enhance its protection to mitigate the effects of the
shock. It is also expected to interact as a community and rebuild promptly in
order to continue in its development.</p>

<p>After playing the game several times, I learnt there are
sometimes you cut back on the time you invest in some of the coping mechanisms
and invest them in others for some specific forms of shocks. For instance, in
very fast moving comets, it will be difficult to invest time and resources in
researching them. I will rather ensure that the protection level of the community
is high enough and also purchase a satisfactory level of insurance to
adequately cope with the effects of the shock. I also learnt that for the rate
of development to be maintained at a fast and steady rate, there need to be a
reasonable level of balance between all the preparation mechanisms (research,
protection and insurance) and not just investing on upgrading the pods in the
community.</p>

<p>As innovative as the game is, there are some sections of it
which requires improvement. In future versions of the game, the time constraint
can be made a little more flexible as possible. In real life situations, there
are usually more time to plan, evaluate different approaches to prepare for a
risk and executing them. That aside, I think it was an effective tool in
explaining the concepts of Risk Management.Â </p></div>
