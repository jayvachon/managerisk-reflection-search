    <div class="field-value">I believe that the reflection is very succinct.

I think this reflection may be better if the student had written some more so that their experience with the components of the game, could be better gauged.  This reflection leads me to believe that the student did have fun playing, but was not perhaps clear on all objectives of the game.  I also get the idea that perhaps the student did not have a huge amount of time available to play the game to express more about his or her experience.  As such all of the listed questions to be addressed in one's reflection have not been treated.  I think the element identified to add to the game is a good idea.  </div>
