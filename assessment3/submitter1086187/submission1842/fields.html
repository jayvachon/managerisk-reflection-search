    <h1>Submission 1842 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1086187, session_user_id: 7b19c76dea1adb251a76755f51d30868b72714ff)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management was crucial in the game, but it was just part of the game and not only necessary but also fun because it was visible. i was not always sure what what means, so I tried to do enough of all, and when a comet hit it was good to see how quick it was possible to rebuild. Next time I would try to better understand when to do what, and buy an insurance, but also keep the protection level high enough. however, building and upgrading pots was also important to have enough wealth. To develop the game I would add another risk, e.g. a flood, so you could build some protection against a possible flood, and the insurance could cover either both or only one of the risks etc.</div>
