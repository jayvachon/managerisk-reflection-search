    <div class="field-value">You mentioned the fear of destruction which costs much for re-building. The fear made you not to build too many buildings in the game. To pursue development, you had to be confident by managing the risk properly.  The strength of your reflection is that you clearly expressed the dilemma of further development and the fear of destruction.

One thing that I would like to mention is that there were little description of the difference between knowledge, protection, and insurance.  Those three actions have different roles and the cost for them are different.  It would be much better if you describe the difference between each of them and how they should be combined.</div>
