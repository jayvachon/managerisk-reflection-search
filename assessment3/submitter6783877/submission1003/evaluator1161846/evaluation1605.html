    <div class="field-value">I like your essay. Your suggestion for the modification in the game is quite interesting. When I read it, my immediate thought was that I fundamentally disagreed with the idea of compulsory insurance. After all, insurance is one of the strategies that can be used to manage risk. If a person chooses not to employ it, so be it. However, after some thought, it does not sound like such a bad idea. For me the reason why it may make sense to force people to obtain at least minimal insurance policy would be the fact that people might choose not to obtain insurance because they are unwilling to spend some extra money before a disaster, but will most likely reach out to the government and seek its assistance one the disaster happens. </div>
