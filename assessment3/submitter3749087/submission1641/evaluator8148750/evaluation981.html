    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection are the thoughts about the role of resource use in risk management, and the importance of improving the use of time and of resources to manage risk more effectively. Also the advice to add a dialogue box as improvement to the game is an interesting point, since it brings attention on the theme of monitoring the use of available resources to improve risk management strategies.
The weak part of this reflection is the description of what happened in the game experience, it is merely a description of what happened according to each choice. This part could be improved adding more general discourse about the role of each factor (knowledge, protection, insurance) in the overall game strategy. </div>
