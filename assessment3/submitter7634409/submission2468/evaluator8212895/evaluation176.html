    <div class="field-value">Key strengths
The reflection depicts the writer clearly understood that, success in risk management is all about trying to strike a balance in the use of resources for development, knowledge (research), insurance and protection.

I think providing references for the risks associated with the country in which the writer lives would make them more credible.
