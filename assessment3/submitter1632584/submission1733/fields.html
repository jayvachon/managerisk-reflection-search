The game was really helpful for making decisions about risk management.The role of risk management in the game was to develop a new environment and to avoid a meteors crash.<br /><br /> I had to face a lot of problems but finally I learned a lot. There were trade-offs between saving money and buying insurance, I had to decide what type of insurance to buy depending on how well did I do on previous games and depending on the kind of meteor to which I was exposured. Most of the time I spent the money in the development of the city, and I did not care much about buying insurance. My preparation for risk affects development after some time.<br />I played the game many times in order to get feedback and to learn from my mistakes. The time was very limited,and I had to decide quickly. I improved after the first time of playing by taking decisions more quickly, building more houses and using correctly the tools giving by the game. The main things I learned from the game were to manage risk properly by knowing the kind of exposures I had, protecting from meteors and getting insurance.  <br />I definitely had a lot of fun, the game was really creative. If I had the opportunity to create a new version of the game I would add a new agent like the Government or others political institutions because I think risk management is a process where many people take part. Furthermore, I will add rains that are very common in my city. <br /><br /><br /></div>
