    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.The role of risk management in the game is being able to make the necessary trade-offs to ensure that when disaster strikes(in this case meteor) I am well well prepared also informed with adequate knowledge about the magnitude, likelihood e.t.c of its impact. Thus I could prepare by building proper structure and also acquire insurance to reduce my cost in the event of an impact. Also, by linking up the community this ensure better preparation.. All this ensure that I was able to cope at a reduced cost even when disaster strikes.<br />Preparation for risk affect the speed at which I starts new development, since I had to acquire knowledge, protection and insurance within a limited time-frame before disaster strikes.<br />2. I played the game more than once so in subsequent plays I managed my trade-offs successfully by not trying to raise my settlement excessively, by researching in order to gain more knowledge about the forth coming meteors and also by re-enforcing my building to make them stronger and reduce the impact of damage when disaster strikes.<br /><br />3. Maybe, information sharing among various stakeholders in my community would help better manage risk in my country.<br /><br /></div>
