    <div class="field-value">The author seems to have a good follow up of the course indeed, he/she described well the resources, ( money, time ), had his point of view about effective risk management, which can be right or wrong,
but i think he/she didn't cover the addressed questions perfectly, especially the 2nd and 3rd questions, 
to be honest it was not simple for me , to follow up with the article considering it as a reflection of the game, i mean all of what was mentioned was clear for an article talking about risk management with a point of view of the author , but not as a simplified reflection about the game,
finally i think he didn't mention too much about his/er experience or what happened, and how his role as a manager changed in the following attempts. i think he should have spoke about his experience more. </div>
