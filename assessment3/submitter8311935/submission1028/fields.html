    <h1>Submission 1028 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8311935, session_user_id: 64e20d74cd44b01e1c8b6dcb1fabbfad2e477437)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game is to
keep the components in equilibrium; both prepare for the risk and cope once a
shock is presented. One of the trade-off I met with during the game was not
getting insured, or at the moment of acquiring an insurance not getting the one
with the higher coverage. Since the comets had different chances of hitting the
community and severities, it was not always necessary to get insured, but
sometimes a meteorite hit Alora and the damage was to big to covered without
insurance.</p>

<p>Preparation for the risk was affecting the
development in short and long term, but it was more critical in long term,
since it is more expensive keep upgrading the ponds. If it was decided to
invest a lot of money in the preparation, then you run out of resources for
developing the community.Â </p>

<p>The first time I played the game, I did not get
the idea that the research on each of the comets had a role and for increasing
it you had to keep the window open, obtaining more time for community
connections when a shock is presented. Once I started to look for longer times
at the information of the comets I realized, that not only the research was
increasing but also the comet might change is characteristics (chance of
hitting and severity). I found it really interesting because it is including
the variability of the risks, and the importance on collecting as much
information as possible to get a more accurate preparation.</p>

<p>I played the game a couple of times and I
realized that the key was to try to maintain a balance between the different components.
In order to make the development bar grow and achieve the milestones set for
each level, there was a need on developing the ponds. But if all money was
expended only in the development then when a shock was presented, the
preparation for overcoming it was not enough, there was no money for insuring the
community and also not resources for covering the damages left after the shock.</p>

<p>As an improvement to the game I will find
interesting to some how add a function in which the agreements with the
communities are represented. At the moment there is a possibility of doing
community connections once a shock is presented, but dealing with people in
order to be prepare for the risk or in terms on which insurance or what sort of
preparation for the risk to take, I also find a really important factor of risk
management.</p>

<p><span>Maybe in order to encourage people for taking
insurance, make the price change not only as there is an advance in the levels
of the game, but also make the insurance cheaper if it for the reason of upgrading
the amount of coverage. By this I mean if you buy an insurance of 50% of
coverage at the beginning of the level and you want to upgrade it for one of
75% of coverage, allow the money you invested for buying the first insurance,
be part of the money you need for buying the new insurance.</span></p></div>
