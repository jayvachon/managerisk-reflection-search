    <div class="field-value">I like the synthesis did this student about his experience in the Risk Horizon Game because it is precise and explicit way without going into unnecessary redundancy. It is noted that the strong point of his reflection is Preparing to face the risk and its impact in reducing losses. Since it is a game that served us to reflect on how playful our learning of the first and second week, I would have liked to see a reflection on their opinion about the version of the software and the difficulties he faced, because this tool can used in different educational and cultural backgrounds.</div>
