    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game highlights the importance of risk management and in fact it is a key to progress to the next level of the game. There were several choices that I made in the game depends on the threats that approaching the village. The initial indications of comet's properties such as severity, likelihood of hitting and speed of the comets had a great impact on how I made the trade-offs among knowledge, protection and insurance. For example, a comet with medium severity but high likelihood of hitting would require some protection/insurance to be taken more than a comet with extreme severity but one to none hitting chance. Building a community also help minimize the adverse affects arise from an impact. </p><p>Although preparation is a must when dealing with potential threat, preparation for risk does have some impacts on development. The immediate effect is that it slows down the development, for example, spending more time on research will enable us to understand more about the risk that we going to face, but as the same time it distracts us from building/upgrading the village. Another negative effects that risk development causes to development is that it consumes the resources which could be used in development. Having said that, if have a right risk management plan in place for a particular scenario, we can minimize the damages that caused by a comet through improving our protection or we can reduce loss and recover faster through having an insurance plan in place.</p><p>After getting a hang of the game, I tried to allocate my resources well to both prepare for the risk and have a coping strategy in place if the impact does occur. Through having a plan in place, the resource was used more effectively to reach the development target. The main things that I learned from the game is that, risk management is a must for development, and different development targets with different threats associated with them requires different strategy to prepare for the worst and cope with the whatever the outcomes could be.</p><p>I would add in a relationship/social interactions among the village members during the risk preparation face to better represent the risk management choices that matter in my area. Coming from an Asian culture, which highly value relationship among friends, neighbors or family members, they rely heavily on this connection when dealing with crisis or preparation for potential threats. The connection/relationship allows them to create a pool resource that they can lean on when bad things arise.</p></div>
