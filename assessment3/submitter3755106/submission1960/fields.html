    <h1>Submission 1960 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3755106, session_user_id: 120a8087e9bca997e4552ccea7d985638ddd3d14)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management
in the game is to weight the chances between development and risk aversion. We
had to develop the colony as soon as possible, which in turn will give us extra
benefits. For example, the faster we developed the faster we could earn money
for upgrades. At the same time, we had to foresee natural destructions by the
comets and the setbacks imposed by this disaster. We had to weight the
advantages and disadvantages of obtaining insurance, with different protection
levels and with different prices. 

<p>Since everything in
the game costs money, we had to balance the development costs versus the
insurance but at the same time we had to obtain in order to minimize or
decrease the damage from the forthcoming natural disasters. I discovered that,
at least in the game, it was best to wait buying insurance until the last minute
and use the money to built more or better pods, which in turn generate more
money in turn. As the game said, everything we do has a cost; either in
recourses or time or opportunity cost.</p>

<p>I played the game more
than once and I tried to change my strategy each time in order to check
different outcomes. I think the best way to play was as described above; wait
till the very last moment before a comet is about to hit before I buy insurance
and even then, only when a comet looked dangerous enough. I also found that
raising the colony was a pretty effective way of risk management, since I could
do it bit by bit, using left-over money from the development of pods.</p>

<p>Although the game is
fairly simple, I donâ€™t think it represents the role of the community connections
properly. Although last minute assistance from other members of the community
could be important, it would have been better if these connections where made
earlier and establish some sort of procedures on how to do it, how to act
together and help each other. The game, may have given us the opportunity to establish
connections before a comet hits.</p>
