    <div class="field-value">Strength is awareness of own personality and recognition of difficulty of applying learning into practice.   Good observation is made regarding effectiveness of protection (which I could not figure and kept investing time in that).
Obviously frustration from playing game shows in the reflection, which makes the reflection interesting as well as a bit more emotional than needed</div>
