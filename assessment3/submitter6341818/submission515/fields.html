    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. I think that the risk horizon game gives us a good idea of how we can balance all the activities or stages involved in risk management.  First of all, it makes clear that everything grows around development or a wealth development activity.  That's what we should focus on.  Risk management only provides a framework to to make wealth creation possible and, to some extent, inmune to shocks or unexpected events.  So everything imoves around the creation of wealth.  Now the first thing we should do in the game is to seek knowledge about the dangers to our wealth creation activity.  In this case meteors.  Then we have to asses the probability of a shock happening at any given moment based in the knowledge we have previously gathered.  This will drive our spending in rsik management.  For the most part is better to prepare for a shock by buying insurance that will cover a relatively low part of the whole value.  That will leave enough resources to pay for protection of the village  moving the level of the village a little higher.  If the protection against shocks is good enough we will only have to spend a small amount in insurance, that is take an accessible plan that will only cover about a third of the total valuation of the village.   The key is to create a good dynamic in which we asses the probability of a shock by keeping a close eye in the environment.  Then we act on the information we gathered.  Now we have information that will tells us how much we should spend on risk management.  For small shocks we only need to spend a little.  For big shocks we have to spend a lot more.  We don't know when we are going to have small or big shocks but we do know that small shocks happen a lot more frequently than big shocks.  If we start spending small amounts on protection very frequently, in time we can build a very robust infrastructure to protect ourselves from shocks while leaving enough money ti spend on wealth building projects or activities.  <br />2. The first time I played the game I was a little clumsy.  I didn't know exactly how it worked but it served as a learning experience.  The second time I completely focused on developing the village as a priority and in preserving it by checking up the sky for threats, buying low insurance and spending a considerable amount moving the ground level until it was safe for shocks in the near future.<br />3. I think the game is fine, unless you want to add a set of different risks instead of just one.  For example, financial risk on wealth creating activities.       <br /></div>
