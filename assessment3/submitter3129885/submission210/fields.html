    <h1>Submission 210 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3129885, session_user_id: c8227905af287538dde89e7f9fc3c7443ec7f7b3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>1.       </b><b>What
was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what
trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?
In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after
some time)?</b></p>

<p>Risk management,
in forms of research, protection, and insurance played a vital role in ensuring
that the gains from the development were sustained in face of adverse shocks, enabling
progress to higher levels. Development undertook the form of building and
upgrading pods, knowledge in form of research to understand the severity and probability
of comet strike, protection in form of raising the level to reduce the flooding
impact, and insurance to reduce the coping costs. The choices were to spend
resources in form of money and time, on development, insurance, protection or
research. Preparing for risk in form of research, insurance or protection
diverted resources from immediate development but paid off in form of more time
to prepare for the adverse events and/or reduced impact of the adverse impact
as well as insurance coverage covered parts of the repairs leading to lesser
burden on resources in post impact period aiding faster recovery.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>2.      
</b><b>If you played the game only once, what
would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you
played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first
time? What were the main things you learned from the game?</b></p>

<p>The main things
I learnt from the game was that there should be a balance between various
aspects of risk management while making sure that immediate development needs
are also being met and resources are not over-concentrated on risk management. Also
preparation is necessary to get one selves and the community ready to handle
shocks without adversely impacting development or ensuring that the impacts are
minimal and recovery is quick. When I first played the game, I spent too much
resources (in hindsight) on protection, but realized from my failures and later
game plays that a balance is needed in all the aspect of risk management and
being prepared and insured is as important as being prepared, and most
importantly developing is important to make sure you meet the requirements to
progress to the higher levels in the context of the game or better standards of
life in real life context.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>3.       </b><b>The
game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine
you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to
change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better
represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</b></p><p>Though the game
covers all the aspects of risk management beautifully, one aspect that could be
added is the risk-opportunity dualism. What I mean is that some of the shocks
could turn out be opportunity rather than risk, and one needs to be well
prepared to cope in both the eventualities, to make sure that losses from risks
are minimized, and development does not suffer large setbacks as well as when
opportunity comes, one is prepared to make full use of opportunity in terms of
having adequate knowledge and resources to gain from the opportunity and make
the progress to a better standard of life or get rid of some risks altogether. Possibly
low levels of floods could be beneficial for production of salt or leading to
increase in fish catch or some such scenario which could be developed so that
some of the comet landings could be beneficial also.</p></div>
