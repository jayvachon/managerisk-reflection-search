    <div class="field-value">The student has clearly tried to reflect on the game in terms of risk management and the course content, which is a big advantage of it. The student obviously tried to write in terms of the course.

 At the same time what is meant is not always clear. Not only because of the wording, but generally because of the style of expression and, IMHO, because the writer was not very clear about he/she meant themselves. This particularly refers to the last paragraph, which for me was confusing, as I didn't quite understand what improvement to the game was offered. So this is the one thing which could improve the reflection- a simpler and clearer way of expressing ideas.
