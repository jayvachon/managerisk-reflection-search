    <h1>Submission 1736 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2393812, session_user_id: 82f6654e9ee3d7504d234b3642b361f7a8e2d558)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game had a huge amount of risk which was reflected in the attacks, insurance (the cover you take) and the community development. There has to be a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance for example, if the severity of the attack is higher along with the chances of hitting then protection has to be of greater quantum and risk cover should also once you move along the stages, so as to cover the risk. If the attack is of higher density then the research work has to be higher along with the protection. If you are hit severely by the attack  and you don't have the risk cover then it will not only have a cost but will also take greater amount of time.The learning's were devoting greater time on research if the attack is of higher density and insurance cover should be larger once your community development level has reached a good level, say Level 3 or more. I played the game twice and these were the learning's. The game needs the player to create a proper balance between all the three things insurance, protection (leveling up) and the research. The attacks were of the similar domain and there should have been different attacks as well exposing to different types of risks. </div>
