    <h1>Submission 1376 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307828, session_user_id: 1e5c330f17d4881a485c55ab9ebdb09007b0e299)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk
is inherent at any phase of life. Every aspect in this world is subject to risk.
Risk may be defined as the possibility of losing something during the course of
life. It is very important to manage risk in order to avoid loss and damage. Risk
management is the process of identification, analysis and either acceptance or
mitigation of uncertainty. Risk management has to be adopted to avoid losses. As
a country develops, it has to confront certain risks to reach the stage of a
developed nation. This game helps to analyse how various risks can pose dangers
for the development of a nation and how it is important to tackle these in
order to have effective development.</p>

<p>Through
this game the importance of risk management could be recognised to a great
extent. The risks in this game were the comets. It was important to tackle the
falling comets along with developing the community. There were 3 factors which
helped in managing the risk here, they were-</p>

<p></p><ul><li>Knowledge- it was important to study the
speed and the severity of loss caused by the comets to reduce the severity of
loss caused due to them. The more research conducted for each comet, the better
was the reduction of risk severity.<br /></li><li>Protection- just having complete
knowledge about the risks was not enough. It was necessary to have adequate
protection against the damage caused if the risk could not be avoided. Therefore,
apt protection should always prevail in times of risks.<br /></li><li>Insurance- any risk cannot be completely
avoided. Hence it is always necessary to take adequate insurance protection
against any uncertainties. By taking insurance in this game, it was clearly
shown that the time and cost taken to revive after the damage was greater
without the presence of insurance.<br /></li></ul><p>Development
is the key driver of the economy today. Development brings along with it the
element of risk. Any country has to consider all risks before, during and after
development. It is not possible to completely eliminate risk. But the risk can
be minimised by taking appropriate protection and insurance.</p>

<p>After
playing the game once, I realised that just concentrating on one aspect i.e.,
development or protection wonâ€™t help. It is very necessary to find an
appropriate balance of risk and development. If one concentrates on only
development, then the upcoming risks will cause major destruction to the
development so far. Concentrating only on risk prevention will hinder
development because risk cannot be removed but only minimised. Hence a proper
research of the prospective risks will help to develop the community at a
faster pace and equal importance to development will also increase the speed of
building a community. The game also taught that any benefit does not come free
of cost. Protection and destruction involves cost. Hence it was necessary that
the cost was used efficiently to prevent huge damage.</p>

<p>The
development of a country does not only depend on natural calamities. Another important
factor that can cause loss to development will be the human factors. There is
an increase in the dangers caused by the human forces by indulging in unwanted
activities like smuggling, crimes etc. Hence, given a chance to add something
to the game, I would consider any danger caused by the human forces that can
act as a risk and is necessary to be managed to avoid losses. Even the
inclusion of other factors like lack of resources, poverty could be considered
as a major hindrance to development for a country.</p>

<p><span>Hence
this game was a good learning experience to have a balance between risk and
development.</span></p></div>
