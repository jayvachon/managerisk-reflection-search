    <div class="field-value">One of the key strength of this reflection: The author understood that “risk management provides us the opportunity to build up a better country.”
One thing that you could add to make this reflection better: The author could have improved the reflection through a) presenting better comprehension of and answering the three original questions more accurately and thoroughly; b) presenting a clearer understanding of the key components of risk management, and how they were applied in the game experience. </div>
