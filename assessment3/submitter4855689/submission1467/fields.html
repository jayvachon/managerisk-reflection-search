    <h1>Submission 1467 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4855689, session_user_id: a64a77f47af4000019425c564131c281294c9547)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I played the game several times to reach
level 5. At the first time I tried all the buttons to test its cost and benefit
in order to prioritize them. And for the second and the three times I tried to exercise
what I had been discovered. As for winning the game, there are several things
need to be noted:</p>

<p>1. Effective protection is the most
important thing when it comes to risk management. As for “effective’, not only
does it mean to do protection work right in time (not way ahead or long after
the accident), but also conduct rescue work right after the accident or
disaster happened.</p>

<p><span>2. In-depth research enables us to forecast
the uncertainty. While as in the game, attention should be equally distribute
to every sudden event rather than stick to a certain one.  Since all the uncertainties have the possibility
to cause serious damages.</span></p>

<p>3. Within the three actions (research,
protection and insurance), insurance is the least helpful one, since it can not
foresee the future or ease the emergent situation. While certain things are
meant to happen, nor pre-research or effective preparation for risk can prevent
them. While insurance enables us to rebuild our country at a lower cost.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In general term, risk management provides
us the opportunity to build up a better country in a more scientific way. You
will be able to foresee the accident, its chances to happen and its severity.
As for a country, the better the infrastructure, the more expensive it will be
in rebuilding or repair the damage.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Last but not the least, I think there are
several parameters missing in the game, such as “people” the morality of people
when it comes to different disaster and it economic loss should be add to the
game to get a better understand of risk management.</p>
