    <h1>Submission 942 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7460346, session_user_id: d9abe1a0a55e2bd702e3ff410ab148c2f9003786)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Risk Horizon game was a fun way to understand the concept of this course,which essentially is about understanding risk and protecting oneself against it,thereby giving way for more opportunities to tap.The game essentially involved building and upgrading pods while protecting them from comet attacks.In order to do so,we had to study the severity and probability of comet attacks and insure the world against it accordingly.<br /><br />This concept can be interpreted for real world scenarios.The first step in dealing with risk is to understand it.In the game we had to understand the comet attack based on its severity and probability of hitting with a lot of research. Similarly,in the real world, we need to spend considerable amount of time and resources on research to understand the variety of risks we have to deal with.In reality, risk may be of different kinds and can be measured based on different criteria but as in the game, the severity and probability of occurrence form the two key factors to evaluate risk.Once we understand the risk we face, we can accordingly protect or insure ourselves against it.In the game,we had two options to protect against risk -protection and insurance.Once we understand the risk and insure ourselves, we can focus on development without much worry.This aspect shows how risk affects development.Thus the game was essentially about risk management to aid development.However it is not possible to have everything managed,hence there were certain trade-offs encountered.For example,if one chose to spend time on research,then he/she would not be able to develop,protect or insure against risk simultaneously.Similarly, we could either choose to buy protection based on severity or buy insurance at a given point in time and either ways there would be a delay or halt in development.Thus the aspects of development, protection,insurance and research were all distinct choices.Choosing one would involve forfeiting the other three at that point of time.<br /><br />Upon the occurrence of a comet attack, we had to follow the glowing lights to reduce damage and spread it across.This is symbolic of risk diversification.Diversification is a key concept in management and investment.For example, a $10 loss in 5 business units is better managed and accepted than a $50 loss in one single unit.Thus the key concept is to reduce damage from risk upon occurrence of that risk by diversifying across various units.There was definitely a difference in strategy when I played the game a second time.By understanding the importance of diversifying risk,I did not have to buy as much insurance as the first time.I focused on diversification strategy than on insurance protection.Secondly, I spent more time on research than money on protection.By doing so, the severity of the comet attack Â and the money spent on protection were both reduced,thus giving scope for development as I had more funds in hand.<br /><br />If i had to design a new game, I would incorporate an important change which is more realistic. This change involves separation of research on risk from development.In the game,while doing research,we were not able to simultaneously develop the pods and upgrade them.I think this is unrealistic in nature for several reasons.Firstly,unlike the real world,the research was free of cost and thus the funds generated were lying idle while conducting research.These funds could have been simultaneously used to develop pods.Secondly,the research aspect related to protection and insurance more than development and hence there should be clear distinction of the 2 elements.Thirdly,as already mentioned,research is a key component of risk management and must therefore cost more than the actual protection or insurance itself.Other than this,the game was well developed and a great learning experience.</div>
