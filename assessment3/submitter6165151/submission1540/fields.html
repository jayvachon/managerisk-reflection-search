    <h1>Submission 1540 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6165151, session_user_id: 2480e957f5e37621be6db92c2a1d7fcdd9201430)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In my honest opinion, the role of risk management in
the game was to effectively and timely combine all the elements available in
game (insurance, research, protection and development).</p><p>The choices I made during the game,
after several unsuccessful attempts, were to:</p><p><span>1.      </span>Quickly develop my colony, so
to get more and more resources</p><p><span>2.      </span>Using part of the resources to
increase my level of protection, by raising the level of the colony up to a
safe (at least for level one and two of the game) step 4</p><p><span>3.      </span>Buy an affordable level of
insurance, usually choosing level 2</p><p><span>4.      </span>Using dead times to research
those comets which were most likely to hit my colony, so to get more time to
create the highest rate of community connections I could right before the comet
hits, helping boost my protection</p><p>The timely combination of these 4
options allowed my colony to achieve level 5 in the game. I tried to achieve
level 6 but it was really tough for me to get that!</p><p>Only after level three, since I had to push
my level of protection at least up to rank 8 (blue ones), the resources used to
get that level affected the development of my colony, since I had to choose
between the lifting of my colony and the upgrading of the colony houses.</p><p>Since I played the game many times, both
because I found it very funny and I hardly wanted to achieve the highest rank,
I tried to maximize the combination of the game options, by:</p><p><span>·        </span>Focusing on researching only
those comets with medium-high chance of hit my colony, avoiding the low chance
and low impact ones;</p><p><span>·        </span>Avoiding buying the most
expensive insurance level, since I noticed I became lazier in my development
and risk preparation choices, when having the highest level of insurance;</p><p><span>·        </span>Try to upgrade my colony houses
as fast as possible, to achieve the development goals within the (quite short
at higher levels) time</p><p>The lessons I learnt from the game are:</p><p><span>·        </span>You cannot rely too much on the
insurance, but you need to prepare yourself for upcoming risks, even the
unlikely ones;</p><p><span>·        </span>Time and resources available to
achieve development goals is not infinite so fast development choices should be
balanced with effective and timely preparation choices;</p><p><span>·        </span>Even if your protection and
insurance level makes you feel safe, a very unlikely and severe event can
occur, and affect your and your community life badly;</p><p><span>·        </span>Only cooperation between
components of a community (from the lowest to the highest level) can
effectively face the damages created by an unlikely and severe event (indeed
the most effective, but most difficult, tool in the game was to create
community connections as fast as possible, in my opinion).</p><p>If I had the chance to improve the game,
I would add some special rockets to be instantly built to destroy the most
severe comets, though getting these rockets should require a considerable
amount of game resources. Another item I would add to the game would be the
environmental costs of the development actions, like an additional cost to be
deducted from each single upgrade of the colony houses.</p><p>



































<span>At last, in order to make the game more
realistic, I would make the community connections harder to get, since it may
happen that some people within the community may refuse to assist other persons
or the negative event just occurred may just prevent them to help other persons
and such affected persons will choose to keep their remaining precious resources on their own families.</span><br /></p></div>
