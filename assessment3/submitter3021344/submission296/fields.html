    <h1>Submission 296 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3021344, session_user_id: 24cfc76151ccb417905412a2fa6c207db559b3aa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game several times, trying different approaches to both strategical development of the area and risk management decisions. Risk management in all my attempts was either empowering the development of the area if I was able to understand and evaluate the threats correctly, organize and effectively manage the protection and insurance mechanisms, or ruining the area in case risks were managed not effectively. It could even prevent the area from recovering and future development. <br />Knowledge was important to understand what protection mechanism to invest in (for example, either to raise a platform more or just to focus on research to get more time for community connections), what threat to focus on in case there are several meteors approaching at the same time. On the other hand I noticed that lack of knowledge can cause big destruction. The main reason why in this particular game a lack of knowledge can happen is a lack of time (for example, when several meteors of the similar power are approaching and a player should choose which ones to focus on and how to allocate attention) to hold a proper research on all the threats. In this case what helps is having systematic knowledge from previous researches and developed protection and insurance mechanisms. <br />When it came to protection, I had to choose between different types of preparation and protection basing on the severity of the threat, it's intensity and costs. It's important to remember that a failure of preparation is a preparation of failure. Protection was saving me in the moments when a meteor that was expected not to hit or to have small severity was causing a huge destruction. Setting protection mechanisms needs resources, time and can cause slowing down of development speed. <br />The insurance as well needs resources, but the resources and time it saves in case of damage are much higher. What is important to note is that insurance was becoming more expensive with each new level that actually was only increasing it's benefits, as the area itself was developing and becoming more valuable and costly to maintain, develop and recover.<br />The main learning points for me after playing this game several times was, first of all, prioritization. With each new attempt I had to choose which threat and which measure to focus on basing on the possible losses, benefits and speed of it's approaching. Secondly, investment to preparation does worth it. Of course, you need to manage resources effectively investing both in preparation, development and savings for future coping. Thirdly, be strategical. Predict and expect what can happen in a future, save resources for coping, put measures on place, allocate your physical resources smartly. Forth, do not underestimate any possible threat. Gain more knowledge. Fifth, be fast, time is limited for preparation and coping equally.<br />If I had a chance to change one simple thing in a game basing on a risk management choices that people are facing in my area, I would change the way player gets and manages the resources (money particularly). They play a key role in risk management in this game, but having one source of money with changing speed and having the single "wallet" can prevent the player from being strategical in resource management. Maybe adding some alternative ways of getting money (for ex., time-limited loans) or creating a management way that would allow the player to plan investments (for ex., different wallets) can help to make better decisions and to manage risks much more in advance. </div>
