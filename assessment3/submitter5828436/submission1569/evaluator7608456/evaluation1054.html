    <div class="field-value">A key strength of this reflection is your idea to bring some realia of different disasters that may be more common in real life.  Rather than meteors causing tsunamis, there could be a range of other natural and man-made disasters.  It might make the "researching" more interesting, and just bring more entertainment to want to keep playing.
One thing that would make this reflection better is to explain in more detail what "long term measures" you were referring to that allowed for progression from level 1 to 2.</div>
