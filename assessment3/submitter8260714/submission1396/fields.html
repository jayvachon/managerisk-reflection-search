    <h1>Submission 1396 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8260714, session_user_id: 76159b4955f5211cd841d174378717806b0c24db)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I learned early on that
purchasing the insurance — at least 50% was ideal. In the games that I was able
to progress quite far, I purchased 75%. This, of course, came at the expense of
developing my town at a fast speed. Because more money was devoted to protection
and not growth and development, there was a slower development path. As a
tradeoff, acquiring more knowledge about impending threats (in this case
the meteors) helped decrease the amount of damage my town took. After a few
meteors, I learned that the cost of recovering and repairing the town with
insurance was less when insurance was previously purchased.</p>

<p>When I played the game
multiple times, I tested different strategies. In the first few plays, I
purchased insurance immediately and then devoted remaining resources to
development. This worked in that there was immediate coverage for the town,
however in some cases there was not much to protect when the meteors came.</p>

<p>In later plays, I purchased
insurance at a later time, usually as I identified a meteor that could
significantly damage the town. This approach allowed me to build up my village,
while scanning for threats. A challenge of this approach though was ensuring
that there was enough funding budgeted for insurance in case a risk appeared.</p>

<p>A third tactic tested
revolved around the speed the base community was built and how they were
upgraded. In some games, I built and upgraded pods in a very systematic
approach. All pods were built, and then all pods were updated. However this
became less of an ideal approach as I ran out of time each levels. As I played
more, I learned better and more efficient patterns on how to build and upgrade
pods in order to maximize revenue. </p>

<p>I think a potential change
that would help make the risk management choices more realistic would be to
offer more specialized forms of insurance. Being able to purchase insurance
that is more specialized and resistant to meteors or floods as the situation
dictates would be a nice – and more challenging – addition. Where I live,
people purchase specialized forms of insurance that protects specific events.</p>
