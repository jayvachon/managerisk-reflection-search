    <h1>Submission 859 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7141740, session_user_id: c64053837451859449d70798d82f8f5606b25309)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game is all about
thinking strategically in all areas. You have to balance the preparation
between different risks, and investing in development of the community and
bearing in mind the tools you have accessible to you. It is like multitasking
among the different projects so as not to allow the other project suffer at the
expense of the one being focused on. It is very important to develop a
community and then, strategize. There should be adequate research and
development, it helps and when the shocks come, there should be adequate
insurance and upgrading as well as research.  To succeed, you have to assess the obstacles
of risk management, once you have gathered some of these information, you are
able to reduce most of the uncertainty about the risk. Risk  is composed by two elements, (probability) and
impact (consequences)and the coping of the after effects. The impact could be
maximized or minimized by the external environment, internal conditions and of
course, the responsible and effective grade of risk management. So, when you reduce
the uncertainty of risk, identifying its causes, (drivers of shocks) and
estimating a possible severity. After that you could treat the different causes
of risk with high severity and then begin to outline the possible policies,
programs or activities to exonerate the risk. Sometimes you may design actions
to lessen only the probability, other time you could only lessen the impact or
even both of them. There is also the control design which is targeted at the
response to each step in what is known as the "risk chain", There could
be control measures to alert us when risk occurs, we can have preventive measures
to prepare us towards the phase. All these could be considered as a strategic
planning model which could be applied to life and business. It is paramount to
make the necessary research, understand the risk and shock involved and design
the possible ideal actions to cope with the after effects. The goal is to
eradicate or lessen the probability of risk and treat the causes of risk.  We can also talk about the protective measures
to lessen the impact and corrective measures ideal to cope with the risk and
after effects.<br />
It is also about having the right resources at the all time. Without the right
or adequate resources to manage these projects and developments, it is quite
difficult to move ahead. No project has more priority than the others, you just
have to invest adequately to most if not almost al of the developments.</p>

<p>I learnt from playing the game that you need to make
adequate research on whatever setbacks that you are prone to have. The risks
that you are prone to have should be given adequate research on to understand
how to handle, confront and cope with. </p>

<p>I would rather modify the frequency of the risks coming upon
a community in the sequence at which it came. There might be communities who
suffer risks in that design but I feel the frequency at which the risks were
coming upon the community was too quick.</p>
