    <h1>Submission 802 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4330934, session_user_id: aa068fbd2570717610c110b922e1d18c98055005)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management played a crucial role in the game. The community Alora has opportunities in terms of development and risks in terms of falling comets. The choices I made were as follows :-
1.	Prioritize the comets based on the level of impact and accordingly gain their knowledge.
2.	Try and maintain high levels of protection which can save from any sort of impact.
3.	Since the resource money was limited, only a bare minimum insurance was taken.
In the beginning of the game when Alora was in the growth phase, development as well as managing risk demanded fewer resources. As the game progressed and reached its advanced stages, development became costlier in terms of requirement of resources as well as managing risk. In the later part of the game risk management started consuming most of the resources and only little resources could be allocated to growth. Hence it was imperative to have a strategy in place wherein resources had to be allocated to the preparation and reduction of risk, mitigating the effects of disaster when it actually struck, and growth of the community. The appropriate allocation of the limited resources on risk management and development helped in reaching to the higher levels of the game.

After playing the game once I realized that I was concentrating more on the development part and lesser on the risks. In my first attempt, I could not achieve the desired results since I had allocated a major chunk of the resources on development and in the process had overlooked the preparation required to mitigate risks. Inspite of initial growth, this led to massive destruction in the later stages.  Also I was consistently trying to optimize the resource utilization by giving each and every Power i.e. knowledge, protection and insurance equal weight without classifying the comets on the basis of their severity of impact/probability of hitting. 
The next time I played the game I was able to comprehend the game better. I allotted the resources wisely to reduce and mitigate the risk as well as took the opportunities available for the growth of the community Alora. 
The main learning from the game was that managing risk is an equally important part in the development of a community. In the case of Alora, it was seen that the community simply perished in the absence of proper risk management. Risk management is mostly seen as a cost/waste of resources. However this is not the case. An active preparation of an event before it actually occurs and an action plan in case a catastrophe hits, should be in place. Also all the constraints should be understood properly and only then an action plan to reduce risk should be developed.

In India one of the major problems is drought. A lot of farmers are dependent on rain for the crops. However rainfall in India is erratic. There is a high risk since in the absence of regular and continuous rainfall, crops perish. This leads to high rates of farmer suicides during such periods.  For the survival of crops, this risk needs to be managed actively. This can be done by reducing the dependence on rains by having water canal systems and artificial means of water supply. Such measures will keep the farmers prepared for drought like situations, thereby reducing the level of impact and leading to higher levels of production. This risk due to uncertainty in rainfall is one feature that can be added in a new version of the game.
