    <h1>Submission 2463 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7890937, session_user_id: 11504af131b6ffaf5fd687d4a25acd24a38b03e0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management framework played an important role in order for me to be successful in the game. This is because the game continuously tested me in terms of strategy, and how I made smart trade-off's between protection, insurance and knowledge, in order to move onto the next level. I played the game more than once, the first time I admit I lost level one, not only because I did not pay more attention to the rules of the game, moreover the game turned out not to be as straightforward as I imagined. My second round, after learning from my mistakes previously, I eventually reached Level 5, and making it the point I decided it was time to end the game and reflect. <br /><br />I understood the overall aim of the game as developing a community of pods located near the sea by building and upgrading them. Community progress was reflected by the development indicators, the green level indicator and the community wealth indicator on the left-hand side of the game. As the community progressed, both indicators increased and in order for me to move onto the next game level, I needed both to reach a desired level. As I was focussed on doing this, the community however was frequently susceptible to serious flooding from meteor collisions and this added to the complexity of the game.  When the community made more money, I had to further upgrade the pods but needed to also invest in risk management tools. The various risk management tools helped me to prepare and make the community more resilient to the flooding. Knowledge tools like "researching" the meteor allowed me to understand collision severity if the meteor were to hit and the chances of that collision occurring. As I researched about the meteor, particularly my second round of the game, I had to learn to trade-off with the pod upgrading and researching about potential collisions. If it did then I had to connect the "green" communities quickly (which were community responses) within a certain time limit. I discovered that if I invested more into research of the meteors, the more time I would get in order to do community responses. Community responses are real-life examples of longterm insurance and protection. Other insurance tools like buying insurance for pods "at 30% in case of X amount of damage", were useful to reduce pod-fixing costs.. Protection tools like "raising the height level of the community" were overall important to reduce flooding damage. However it was extremely expensive, and if I invested too much in this tool, the green level indicator would fall and the community wealth indicator would also decrease. This was probably the biggest trade-off lesson that I learnt form the game. The more I tried to raise the community above sea level, in order to protect it, I found that it was counter-acting the progress. This is why I lost level 5. I invested too much into protection and insurance, and in the case of my game, no collisions happened in Level 5, and the community wealth indicator was close to zero. In other words, I invested too much into risk management, and I overspent. I think in the real world this is the case of countries spending too much in capacity and getting into debt and not being sustainable. If I could improve the game, I would probably ask for more blurbs at each level to provide more explanation about the trade-offs made and how certain actions led to defeat or success, this particularly important for countries to understand and learn from for risk management.<br /></div>
