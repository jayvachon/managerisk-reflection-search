    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that he/she has drawn out a clear link between the game and real life. He/She compares the problems in the game, the risks and opportunities available, and links them to problems, risks and opportunities that we face in reality. This recognising of a link and understanding it is essential in managing risks anywhere in the world and at any level.

One thing that I think would have made this reflection better is by describing his/her progression in the game in more detail. He/She has not described the actions he/she took in the first attempt of the game and how he/she changed their course of action to better manage risks in the game. A more detailed description of this would show his/her deep understanding of the game and its technicalities.  </div>
