    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the fact that this student has understood how to play the game efficiently and successfully.

The one thing I think would make this reflection better is to have omitted a lot of things that were written about the actual game; it seems as if 70% of the essay is about the description of the game and only 30% is about the relevance of the game with the lectures and readings. I think the link between the game and the videos and lectures is more important than the mere description of the game.</div>
