    <div class="field-value">The student successfully provided feedback to all the research questions demonstrating a good knowledge and understanding of the risk management elements studied so far. He/she uses appropriately examples from the game's outcome to provide comparisons with real life situations.
Although the structure of the document is clear and logic, the thing the student could have done better is perhaps paying more attention to the writing style within the paragraphs which tends to get long at confusing from time to time (e.g. in the paragraph beginning with "since high-risk...").</div>
