    <h1>Submission 987 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3560418, session_user_id: 001f7520974ee13648f45259ad5d2aae0ec1e759)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I think the role of risk management in the game was fairly
straightforward, as the key to success was balancing the development of the
community against mitigating the effects of disasters.  Of course, this could be done in three ways: </p>

<ul><li><span></span>Knowledge: Researching comets to learn more
about the likelihood and potential impact of the coming disaster to better
prepare accordingly.  It also effectively
acts as a form of insurance in which the player is transferring their time from
good situations to bad.<span></span></li><li><span></span>Protection: Building up the community’s defenses
to reduce the impact of disasters after they hit.  

</li><li><span></span>Insurance: Transferring financial resources from
good times to bad in order to more quickly get the community functioning after
a disaster has struck.  </li></ul><p>Essentially, one had to develop the community in order to
keep the bar moving and win, but the player also had to be prepared for possible
setbacks by investing resources, which could otherwise go towards development,
into knowledge, protection, and insurance. 
Of course, transferring resources towards disaster mitigation negatively
impacted development in the short-run.  </p>

<p>If I could play the game over again I probably would not do
it, because there does not seem to be much of a way of actually winning.  The first few times I played through I generally
tried a mitigation-maximizing strategy, on the assumption that a game about
risk management would encourage minimizing risks.  However, that did not work, and I figured it
was probably because risk management is about also seeking, and taking
advantage of, opportunity.  Therefore, I
next tried more development-based strategy, which did not do very well
either.  </p>

<p>Since high-risk, low-risk, and balanced attempts all did not
work very well, I figured I needed to get smarter about how I balanced my
risk.  At that point I figured that
because risk management is generally about transferring resources from good times
to bad, and because we can transfer both financial and time resources, I needed
to do a better job of balancing how I distributing my money and time.  Therefore, I figured that since in the early
game financial resources are relatively scarce, and time resources are
relatively abundant, I would focus on using my time to mitigate risks by researching
comets, and focusing my financial resources on development.  As the game went on, and my financial
resources became more abundant, relative to time, I would focus more of my
disaster-mitigation efforts on resource-dependent methods, such as insurance
and protection.  To me this strategy
seems to best represent real-world risk management and explain why developed
countries, such as the Netherlands, focus their disaster mitigation efforts on
resource-dependent strategies, such as building dykes, whereas developing
countries focus disaster mitigation on time-dependent methods, such as building
community support.  Of course, in the
game this strategy did not work either.  </p>

<p>As for improving the game, the biggest aspect that could
change is just making it a little easier, as there does not seem to be a
consistently viable strategy of winning. 
Also, I would change how the insurance system works.  At present, the best strategy with insurance
is to wait until the last instant before the comet hits before buying it, which
of course is extraordinarily stupid in the real world, because the point of
insurance is that people do not know when disaster will strike and the system
depends on people paying-in during good times.
