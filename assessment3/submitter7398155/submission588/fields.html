    <h1>Submission 588 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7398155, session_user_id: 2a01922423453f212756b73470490e39f4a7deef)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>The role of risk management in the game was to make a balance between risk preparation and developing a community in Alora. As the leader of the community I had to make decisions, I had to economize the usage of the community's resources between researches, protection and insurance. In my opinion the main purpose was to make choices under uncertainity and optimise the usage of resources to protect the city.<br />I had to make choices and compromises because in each round I had limited time to achieve all the goals (develop the community, do researches, build protection). Every action costs money and time - which is really a rare resource in this game. On the basis of my reasearch I gaind information about the severity of the meteors and checked my protection level. In case I realized that my level of protection is not enough I had to stop doing researches earlier. I bought insurance in every round so that I had the opportunity to make a lot of community connections when my community was hit by a meteor.<br />Preparation for risk affected the development of my community immediately when I had only a little money which I spent for Insurance. I had to wait and collect more resources to spend some money on protection or on development. Building protection always made my pods stop developing. I'm not sure but I think that making the more research made the pods develop faster.<br />After I played the game once I decided that during the next games I'm goning to buy insurance and balance more carefully between recearch ang protection. I tried to develop only some of the pods and leave the others on a basic level, but in this cases the development level was not enough. I learned that it is important to develop your community balanced and equally to reach a healthy level of development. It was important to have protection </span>too<span>, beacause without protection the community got damaged and I lost some time while re-building the pods. Research is important but it is impossible to monitor all meteors on the highest level, in case I had 6 or 7 meteors I checked all of them and monitored (researched) the more sever for a longer time.<br />If I had the opportunity to add something I'd like to add a more specific feedback at the end og the levels. For example in one of my games I got really severe meteors, so I decided (after buying the average insurance) to buy the highest level insurance too. And at the end, after loosing the level I got the message that "If you would like to protetct the community you should buy insurance". Sometimes it is annoying and not helping the player to understand what was wrong or not good enough.</span></div>
