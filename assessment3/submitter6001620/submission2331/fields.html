    <h1>Submission 2331 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6001620, session_user_id: b3c96d2f4e3762d4a85edf130508c1f93b18be0a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management was important in terms of evaluating the
potential risk and severity of the meteor strikes and how to mitigate the
damage from strikes.  I personally relied
heavily on the research aspect, as this allowed me to ascertain to a greater
degree the severity and likelihood of a strike. 
First, this allowed me make the decision as to whether the meteor was “worth”
addressing.  That is, if the severity was
very low or it was not likely to strike, I could more or less ignore the
meteor.  This allowed me to focus time
and resources on other more likely and / or severe meteors.  With the severe meteors, because of the time
spent researching, I was able to react in the event of a strike and limit any
potential damage.  This meant that I had
to spend less time on protection, which ultimately led to me losing on level 5.  The damage that I suffered from a severe meteor
strike ultimately slowed my development too much for me to be able to reach the
goal.  With the time spent focusing on
knowledge, I also may have neglected the protection aspect.  I might have better spent resources building
up protection over time, rather than in response to an imminent meteor strike.</p><p>I might focus more on protection and insurance if I were to
play again, though this might decrease development to such an extent that I
might lose earlier.  When I played, I
tended to prioritize funds in the following order: development, knowledge,
protection, and insurance.  This was an
effective strategy in the early levels, though perhaps as the severity of the
strikes get higher, it becomes more important to mitigate risk with insurance
in order to lessen damage from the inevitable severe meteor strike.  This is perhaps analogous risk management in
the real world: countries must alter their risk management in the early stages
of development to address differing needs at various stages of
development.  For instance, countries
might need to focus on development above all else, in order to address the
needs of the population.  As a country
progresses through stages of development, it needs to shift it strategies to
prepare for disasters and shocks, which may both impede future development and
lead to greater net losses than in the earlier stages.  Finally, as a country reaches a highly developed
stage, insurance and protection to ensure that all gains are protected becomes
the most important aspect.</p><p>



</p><p>If I could add something to the game, I might add different
types of disasters as well as different types of development.  The differing types of development, perhaps
social, medical, science, etc. would help to increase the knowledge
aspect.  These would then be used to
address the new types of disasters, perhaps things such as disease, famine,
war.  This would add more of a “real-world”
aspect to the game, though it would of course increase the games complexity.  </p></div>
