    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that all answers were comprehensive and embraced all the questions . All the strategies , used in the game , are described in the reflection. 
It was very interesting to read this reflection , so to make this reflection more interesting you could probably make it more lengthy . But I am not telling it's short . Just not long enough to make it more interesting.
