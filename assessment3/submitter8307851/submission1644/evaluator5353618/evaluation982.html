    <div class="field-value">The key strength of your game essay assignment was the clear and concise manner in which it was written. You answered the questions as proposed. You provided the reader with your experience in playing the game when you revealed, “…It would be difficult for a person who is playing for the first [time] to access the risk involved and the possible consequences by the unforeseen factors.” In reflection, I agreed with your observation. I’m not a gamer and plus a concrete learner (hand-on, see by doing). Initially, my game focus was on the comets something I couldn’t control; and not on what I could… However, when I reviewed the comments regarding the game on the discussion forum, one student provided a screen shot of his Level 5 or 6. This helped me to see what the community of Pods could looked like. I finally reached Level 5 after, what seemed like 100 restarts (from the beginning) or more. I enjoyed reading your paper. Hope you are benefiting from the course content as much as I am. Thanks
One thing that I think would make this reflection better would be for you to describe you experiences in either the fun you had in playing the game or any frustrations you encounter while playing.
