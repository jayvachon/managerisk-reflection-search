    <div class="field-value">Overall it's a very well written, evocative, thoughtful and insightful piece. I have objections to  the author's statement: "By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit."
How does buying insurance reduce (or, conversely, enhance) your chances of getting hit (or not)? The author's comprehension flails there. Therefore, I've downgraded his or her otherwise fine write-up by one point in the comprehension section. 
The author ends the essay well, raising important points. </div>
