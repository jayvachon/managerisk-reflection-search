    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>Risk management involves both the ability to prepare for risks and to cope with the effects of shocks. In the game Risk Horizon, risk management included increasing knowledge of comets that threatened the world, obtaining insurance against comets known to be threats, and protecting the planet by raising the level of the community above waves caused by comet strikes.</p><p>As a player in the game, I made choices that affected whether my community succeeded, as tracked by the color meter display. Sometimes, I chose to focus on development. As my community grew, my success rate on the color meter increased. The choice to focus on development often hindered my ability to withstand shocks from the comet waves. Compared to real world examples of risk management obstacles, my focus on development choices was like a lack of information. I knew the comet risks existed, but if I wasn’t paying attention to the threats, I would fail at properly managing the risk. Similarly, if I knew I could buy insurance and ignored it, my incentives may have been too strong to raise the color meter instead of protecting against shocks.</p><p>One important lesson I learned was that I was avoiding risk. Admittedly, I played the game multiple times because I found it difficult to advance. In the MOOC, I’ve learned this is often the case in developing countries where shocks seem unavoidable or the cost of one shock impairs one’s ability to cope with other shocks. Like a farmer who selects safer crops when faced with a dry season, I stayed focused on the risk of a devastating comet strike. I didn’t take enough risks at first to learn more about the comets or evaluate my own ability to respond with preparation or protection.</p><p>As I repeated levels, I gained knowledge about each comet. I compared the comet severity to my own preparation and protection. If I could raise the community ground to avoid waves, I could turn my attention away from the potential shock to focus on increasing development and my own success. Similarly, when information revealed potential devastation or a high certainty of shock, I could purchase insurance and temporarily divert resources from growth.</p><p>If tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would add information about how much each development level (undeveloped plot, single house, larger structure) added to the growth rate of the color meter for game success. In the MOOC, I’ve learned knowledge helps people prepare for risks. With more information about the economic output of different development levels, I could better evaluate how many resources should be placed to preparing or protecting against risk. Hopefully, with better judgement, I could allocate the maximum amount of resources to improve development outcomes and game success.</p><br /><br /></div>
