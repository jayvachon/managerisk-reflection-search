    <div class="field-value">Thank you for your clearly articulated essay.

Very strong articulation of the two choices of the player. 
You have very well described the trade-offs and the preparation for risk. 
You also outlined your change in strategy very clearly.

One thing which I would propose to strenghten is the combination with the lectures and the videos.

Overall, well done!</div>
