    <h1>Submission 1253 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7682393, session_user_id: 716586bf2097a44f0565af492f30b59dbde647fb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game is <strong>capacity building  </strong>of a community by <strong>increasing protection </strong>and taking insurance to reduce the loss. The strategy for risk management in this game is by gaining knowledge on disaster or risk and its damage to be cause by commit and increasing the communities protection to decrease the damage. Insurance decreases the cost of reconstruction and sharing resources with other communities enables fast recovery systems. Risk affected areas need to be reconstruct as early possible and also increases their capacity to protect them from the damage of risk in future. <br />I played more than once. I used different strategies to increase capacity, another time I tried increase capacity along with insurance to reduce cost of reconstruction and time. When there is frequent disasters/attacks we need to increase our knowledge, increase capacity building, which uses to mitigate the risk and sharing resources with the community people to form sustainable communities. I learned main things are gaining knowledge on risk, capacity building of communities, how to mitigate risk (in this game research), how to reduce the cost of damage (by taking insurance), sharing knowledge and resources with communities, we need to conscious about the risk while developing an area, otherwise there will be a significant damage.<br />I would like to change the sharing of resources thing because there is less clarity to understand about that. Another thing at the impact due to disaster is not similar for entire community but I observed that every disaster has equal effect on all elements. So I want to change that thing.<br />Finally I enjoyed in playing this game. But I'm not able to cross 4th stage.  </div>
