    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of the game was to test the trade-offs in the process to develop the "city", mixing the insurance with protection and knowledge. I noticed that for being possible to develop the "city" its necessary take care of the 3 parts, if only research and don't grow the city for example, I won't pass to the next level. By researching the level of severity and the chance of hit can get lower, and by protecting the city I noticed that the chances of the city being hit get lower too. Other important thing is to develop the building and build more to have time to pass the level. </p><p>What I did different when I played again was trying to mix the trade-offs, and the actions as well so I could pass some more levels in the game and develop more my city. Even so, I couldn't get any further than level 4.  The main thing I learned from the game was to be aware of the trade-offs that exists, and to act fast, don't procrastinate, because when a problem happens, we have to have agility to solve the problems, and like the correct choice to make is usually not clear, we have to look the possibilities available and try to do the best choice and fast as we can, to minimize the losses if something goes wrong.</p><p><br /></p></div>
