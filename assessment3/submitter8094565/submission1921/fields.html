    <h1>Submission 1921 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8094565, session_user_id: 0288e1d146591f88fedcf89fb06815f399df4597)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Answer 1</b>: Alora
falls victim to falling comets. These comets hinder the development of the
community. Through Risk management, a balance had to be created between the
development of the society and preparing for the shocks arising through the
comet strike. Through research, protection and insurance against the threats, I
could take enough risks and grab opportunities to develop the community despite
existence of potential threats from comets.</p>

 Choices I made in
regard to Knowledge, protection and insurance are:<br /><ul><li>I gained sufficient knowledge of comets with
high severity and high chances of hitting the pods. This cost me a fair amount
of money but I found it important and balanced it with development</li><li>Protection against comets was always my
preference. Based on trends of comets which were attacking, I made investments
for protection. This though was traded off with the development of community to
some extent.<br /></li><li>Insurance plans were chosen based on how much my
community is developed and what is severity and hitting threats of comets. I
ensured I choose the best plan as per present scenario even if I have to spend
some extra money. But insurance provided me with confidence of grabbing
opportunities of developing city.<br /></li></ul><p>Preparation for the risk helped me develop the community to
advanced level. Had I not taken insurance plans or protected the city in
advance, I would not have taken risk of developing community or spending enough
resources for it.</p>

<p><b>Answer 2: </b>If I
play the game again, I would make a better balance between the protection and
insurance. I spent high amount on both protection and insurance, and thereby
had to trade off to high extent for the development of the community.<b> </b></p>

<p>The main thing that I learned from the game is that risk
management does not mean that we stop development of the society and first
fully cope up with the potential risks. Using risk management tools as well as
developing the society has to go on simultaneously. Paying attention to just
risk management at the expense of community development or vice-versa does not
serve the cause totally. The other important thing is choosing the options
wisely. There will always be many options available to mitigate a risk, but
choosing the options available requires knowledge and research.</p>

<p><b>Answer 3: </b>The
game was well<b> </b>designed in order to
explain risk management though practical experience. The one change that I
would like to bring to the game is showing the player with comparison of
different options available with him/her from the available risk management
tools. </p>

<p>Right now in the game, only financial factors control the
choice of protection or development of society. We can make advancements in the
game to include other factors like political, social, technological or
environmental which would control our decision of making choice between
available options.<b></b></p></div>
