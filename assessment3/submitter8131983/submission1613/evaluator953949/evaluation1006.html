    <div class="field-value">1.	The key strength of this reflection was the final suggestion about incorporating community self-groups and further discussion about past experiences and future shock probability. 

2.	My suggestion to strengthened this reflection will be to articulate more about the trade-offs made when using risk management tools to prepare/response to risk. The author explains the constraints of the game and the available resources to mitigate the potential risks. However, I will like to see her/his take about why a choice was better that the other. I think that while playing the game some strategies revealed themselves. Did the author find useful to play the game over and over to visualize this strategy?
