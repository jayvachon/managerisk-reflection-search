    <div class="field-value">This essay has provided with many good concepts and understanding about risk management, taking a case of London. The writer has made a well-done analysis of trade-offs between research, insurance and protection. However, this essay would have been more convicing if the writer had considered the questions 2 and 3 which were mostly missed, instead of only question 1.</div>
