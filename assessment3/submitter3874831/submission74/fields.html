    <h1>Submission 74 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3874831, session_user_id: 24046bb6df01824bdf46b81bb4a81c8bf46988ac)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In
this game, risk management played an important role in building prosperity of
the community and building resilience which enhances the ability of the
community to recover from the negative shocks – the falling comets. To maintain
a perfect balance between the growth of the community and preparation for the
potential shocks, firstly, I choose to develop the building. Meanwhile, I did some
research on the comets. With a small amount of money, I had the knowledge of
the chance of the comets that will hit the community and the severity of the
hit. This helps to decide how much protection I should buy.  By accumulating the research, I have extra
more time to create community connections which will help to boost the
protection and lower the risk of being affected by the shock.  When I realise there is a comet that will
bring severe damage to the community and I have not enough money or time to
increase the protection, I will buy insurance to lower the cost needed to rebuild
the buildings. Buying insurance and protection is costly to upgrade the buildings
along the game. However, in long term, it prevents and reduces the happening of
the crisis and unleashes the opportunities to build and upgrade more buildings.</p>

<p>The first experience playing this game, I failed the mission
at level 1. I had been too focused on development and did not do much research.
 By playing the game over and over, I
learned to observe and make analysis before actions. I used less money in
protection and insurance but successfully avoid the community from damage.
Thus, I had extra money for more development. Over focusing on one side, either
development or preparing for risk seems to bring benefit for the community in
short term. Only a perfect balance between these two elements will bring long
term prosperity to the community.</p>

<p>If I am given the chance to improve the game, I would like
to add in other obstacle such as war between countries.  Military spending is usually huge and the negative
effects that wars bring can be extremely large. As the Luminator, the player
will need to choose which side to emphasize more (comets or wars) and bear the
opportunity cost. In reality, we will face various obstacles at once and we
should manage these risks according to the severity and the urgency of the problems.</p>
