    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the author was able to link the risk management principles to the elements of the game. The author also emphasized the balance between risk management and community development, which was important. This reflection could be improved by linking the elements of the game to real life experiences, at least in an abstract way. While the author demonstrated knowledge of risk management in the game, he or she did not explain how the game is a metaphor for real life occurrences, except briefly in the last sentence.</div>
