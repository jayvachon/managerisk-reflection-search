    <div class="field-value">The key strength is Knowledge sharing and Communication. 
I think you should pay more attention or indicate more clearly the process of preparation before the risk occurs: research, do everything possible to increase the shock resistance of the community as upgrading and implementing protection, even buy insurance (if the risk is too high, in fact in the course of playing game I almost did not buy insurance because my research and protection level is the equal of comets threaten level ). This is a very effective way to sustainable development. 
After all , I completely agree with you that as much doing research as much reducing risk, and if the risk occurs, the rapid and accurate connection between pods in the community will minimize damage or even no damage.</div>
