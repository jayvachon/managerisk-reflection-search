    <h1>Submission 106 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3114356, session_user_id: 04fd802aa5bdecc56d6ba2207c41182208f09092)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management in the game was to provide an evaluation of your choices.  If you built to fast, you did not have money to for insurance or have the ability to protect the buildings.  If you built to slow, you did not have the resources to develop.  If you focused on building and not watching for calamities, you could not protect the buildings or have time to repair.</div><div><br /></div><div>I did not do well in the game.  I tried a few times but never got past level two.  At first I was very conservative in building and learned latter about raising the city to protect against floods.  I tried building faster only to realize I did not need the fanciest buildings.  I tried with insurance but it provided me longer life.  The choices I made were smaller buildings and lots of insurance, and many buildings with the pretty green connecting them.  I made trade offs trade-offs in terms of knowledge or research on the events that created destruction, protection, and insurance.  The most I was able to figure out in terms preparation for risk affect development was to repair my buildings after they were damaged or raise the buildings in case of flood.</div><div><br /></div><div>I played the game a few times and I am not sure if I learned anything in terms of mastering the game.  I wish there was cheats to help me.  What I learned is that ounce of prevention went a long way and acting sooner to a disaster paid off wonderfully.</div><div><br /></div><div>I come from a more structured risk methodology.  The process that I use is called Failure Modes Effect Analysis.  It looks at severity, occurrence, and detection.  Generally we look at servility.  The concept is that we cannot change severity, but we can work on minimizing occurrence and improve in our detection.  I felt like I was chasing severity and I would have rather focused on the the other two aspects of risk.</div><div><br /></div><div>Another aspect of the game I would include is an aspect of learning.  I could not tell if I was learning or lucky.  I could not figure out if I was chasing events that were related to each other, or random events.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
