    <h1>Submission 1485 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5516444, session_user_id: 1f040fed30517ca134454fd558b614501a9c37d7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1.       </span>Playing the game for the first time I
realized the importance of risk management in a developing society. I played
the game several times unfortunately only reaching level 3 and realized that I had
to choose between knowledge, protection or insurance. If I spend all of the
money in protection and insurance there will be little left to invest in
building and upgrading the pods. During the game you have to compromise and let
some of the comets hit you and repair the damage which if you had insurance has
very cheap. I also noticed that over-preparing for the comets has a huge effect
in the development which is visible after level 1 and I came to the conclusion
that I had to change the way I play the game after every level.</p><p> </p><p><span>2.       </span>The first time I played the game ,
as I fore mentioned, the majority of the money was spend in research which made
it impossible for me to complete level two. So I had to change my tactic and spend
more money in building and upgrading pods which I did the second time I played
the game. This tactic was very difficult to follow because of the lack of the insurance
I spend all of the money in repairing the pods. The last time I played the game
in every level I tried buying the most expensive insurance, which made it
easier to recover after the comets and also gave me the money to build and
upgrade pods and also leaving me enough to research. I also realized that in
order to develop fast it was better to upgrade the already existing pods rather
than building new ones. Lastly, in the end of each level it is very helpful to
have some money saved so that you can buy insurance in the next level.</p><p> </p><p>Playing the game I learned that with taking the risk to develop you has
a better chance in succeeding. Also that risk management means you have some
kind of insurance. While I was playing the mistakes I made regarding risk
management were the underestimation of risk and that I had only a short-term
view.</p><p> </p><p>











</p><p><span>3.       </span><span>I think that it would be interesting
to make it a multiplayer game in order to understand how can different players
effect (positively or negative) each other.</span></p></div>
