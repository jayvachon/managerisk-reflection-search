    <div class="field-value">Hello! It was obvious that you had reflected deeply on the game. I liked the way you connected concepts of risk management to aspects of the game. I would just like to note that your reflection could be improved by perhaps being more specific in describing how you played Risk Horizon. Nevertheless, congratulations!</div>
