    <div class="field-value"><strong></strong><strong>The role of risk management and trade-offs faced</strong><br /><br />Risk management played a crucial role in the game in protecting the pods from shocks so that they could develop and in turn prosper with as little hindrances as possible. Managing the risks faced by the pods, the comets, was essential to prevent damage to them which circumscribed their development. When observing an oncoming risk, one had various options to consider. It was necessary to perform a mental calculation of the severity of the shock and probability of being hit weighed against the costs of the various methods available to the practitioner. I often traded off between protection and insurance depending on the severity of the comet or the likelihood of it hitting. I also had to make decisions about how long to research the threat before taking action as the severity and probability would vary depending on your level of knowledge.<br /><br />I realised there was an essential balance to be struck between protecting and insuring against risk on one side, and developing and continuing improvements to the pods on the other side. If too much money was spent on insurance and protection it was impossible to meet the development goals in the allocated times. Similarly, the role of research was extremely important as it often provided a very cost effective way to decide whether to take further action to avert the risks posed by the comets or not. The more preparations in place to manage the risks the quicker and more effectively the pods could develop. Also, I observed that purchasing insurance was a factor which has a significant upfront cost but had long-lasting benefits in reducing costs later on with subsequent shocks. Once the insurance was in place, it was possible to spend more money on developing the pods and not worry so much about spending on protection and repairs in the aftermath of shocks.<br /><br /><strong>Lessons learned in the game<br /><br /></strong>In the first round of the game I did not weigh the relative importances of each method and so ended up spending too much money and time on insurance and protection and neglecting development of the pods as a result. This showed the importance of properly distributing resources, sometimes realising that it may be better to accept some damage and cope with it afterwards than implement excessively expensive measures at the beginning which limit resources for development. I also learned the importance of research and acquiring information as I played the game as I observed that, often, the probability of being hit changed the more research that I did. This either allowed me to save resources by not needing extra protection, or helped me avoid later costs to repair damages because I was able to perceive a higher risk in good time and take the necessary steps to protect against it.<br /><br /><strong>Possible changes<br /><br /></strong>If I were to change the game to better encapsulate realistic risk management scenarios, I think the main change I would make would be to try and introduce different types of risk. Risk management is so complicated because individuals and societies face many different risks with imperfect information and often have to make decisions based on limited knowledge. At the moment, the game includes only systemic risks; the comets. It would be effective to include some idiosyncratic risks as well to try and learn how to prioritise between household and broader, national risks and see how to allocate resources to manage both types of risks effectively.</div>
