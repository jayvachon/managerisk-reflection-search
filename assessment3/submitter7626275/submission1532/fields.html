    <h1>Submission 1532 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7626275, session_user_id: 5e1518d6073d5dee35a44f6364116369d39aa22f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The role of risk management in the game was to balance  between preparing for the shocks (comets) while at the same time expanding the community by using research, protection and insurance.  The choices I made and the trade-offs I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance were intriguing.  </span></p>
<p>First in Knowledge<span> I learned to research every single comet passing through by analyzing its severity and chances of hitting my community.  The more I researched the comet the more I was prepared with how severe the comet was and how to prepare my community by letting them know and preparing by insuring and protecting their pods. Second, </span>Protection-wise the higher the severity of the comet hitting the more the protection. I would save my resources for a more severe comet hitting the community because by understanding the possible shocks (comets) and by reducing the chances of the severe losses from the comets (shocks) and taking advantage of researching the comets when I knew the severity and chances to hit us were low and increasing money to expand my community, plus community network increased protection. Third, Insurance was increased when I believed the shock would be severe and protection would match the severity of the comet to save on insurance. If I had to repair the pods at least the amount to invest in the pods would not affect us as much and at the same time invest the money to upgrade the pods.</p>
<p><span>Preparation for risk affect development was done immediately to avoid any surprises and loss of money in the beginning while preparing to research each comet to avoid higher risks. </span></p>
<p><span>I played the game more than once, what I did differently after the first time playing the game was building more pods to increase my community, researching every moment I could and matching the protection to the severity of the each shock.   I learned from the game how to think more strategically and how to balance between preparing for each risk and managing to develop my community at the same time by using the resources given to me.</span></p>
<p>I would propose to change certain aspects of the game to represent the risk management choices that matter where I live such as include health, politics, government , regulation aspects to make the game more real.  This way I could understand how each section interacts and affects each other to reach the goal.<br /></p></div>
