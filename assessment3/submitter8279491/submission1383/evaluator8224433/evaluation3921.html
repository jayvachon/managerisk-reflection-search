    <div class="field-value">the analysis  of the tradeoff of building new pods X upgrading existing pods was a very strong point in this argument, cleary shown in the next trial of the game where the player could  control development and damages more easly. MAybe a bit more explanation on how the game went could have been usefull ( which level did you reach) as I have no basis for comparison with my technique which was to build and upgrade as many pods as I could ( reaching level 5, pods costing 750$ each ffor upgrading). </div>
