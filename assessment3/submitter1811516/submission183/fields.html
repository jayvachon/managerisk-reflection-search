    <h1>Submission 183 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1811516, session_user_id: 005054d3bdf9dd3c8fc11ba9236a39eada8fa363)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>The role of Risk management is very well defined in this game in 4 contexts i.e. with Knowledge/Information, Protection, Insurance and also coping.In terms of knowledge clicking on the comets helps us to do more research on that comet. In terms of protection right hand side verticle bar helps us to set the protection level based on the severety of shock generated by comet. In terms of insurance the specific button with insurance gives us three choices of insurance with 25%, 50% and 75% protection after the loss. In terms of coping the use of repair function helps us to rebuild bildings. Development runs very slow while preparing for the risk on the other hand it is good to achieve constant development instead of repairing after loss. Preparation for risk affects immediately. In one of the level I forgot to buy insurance which made me to pay huge cost for reparing the buildings. Initially I did not study the attacking comet which caused me huge loss after the shock. Sometimes I did not pay attention to sufficient protection which made me to suffer with huge unnecessary loss. Most of the risk preperation activities are common sense which we are just needed to get reminded throguh the process and techniques of risk management.</div><div><br /></div><div>First time i started building all the pods at available locations but it finishes your money quickly instead if you build only one pod at first level and upgrade it to final stage. Do this for rest of the pods in sequence. This helps to use money wisely by keeping balance between risk preparation and development. I learned from this game that don't start development blindly without understanding the risk and without preparation for the risk.</div><div><br /></div><div>The addition which I would like to make in game is that If game can be started with options like decision tree analysis by asking 'do you want to use risk management or not?'. If some one choose 'no' he can understand the huge loss because of not applying risk management. As per my experience people are used to get in firefighting and then fix the problems. They do not understand if risk managment is implemented it will save huge cost which they will not see because there will not be any firefighting situation. May be this game will help them to understand this scenario. </div><div><br /></div><div>In my area I would like to propose the 'rainfall insurance and innovation in planting different crops instead of regular one' for Farmers. The reason is the amount of suicides because of no success in agriculture is increasing since last 8 years for which the reason is uncertain rainfall, farmers tend to grow up same up crops instead of taking a risk of planting other crops which can grow up with less water and can give good returns.</div></div></div>
