    <h1>Submission 599 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6588211, session_user_id: 7b0e654fc03476691ca7b95aead09e63547f0dec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was to develop the community while at the same time being able to protect, research and insure the assets we have built in order to avoid shocks when they come (in this case in the form of comets).<br />Some of the trade offs are the following:<br />When you are working on something you cannot do anything else. For example, when you are learning or researching about the comets you cannot do any other thing, as to protect the village or to buy insurance. Therefore you have to optimize the time you are researching, developing or thinking about buying the insurance. If you stop researching and then come back again, it has a low cost but that has to be considered as well. <br />Another thing, mostly in the first two levels of the game, was how to allocate the limited financial resources available among the protection, insurance, research and actually build or develop the community. <br />In my view, it was important to have a comprehensive and balanced approach to the whole risk management (protection, insurance, research) while at the same time develop the community. <br /><br />I played several times in order to reach level 4 (I was stuck in level 3 at the beginning). What I did different was, first of all, to try to adequate the protection to each threat coming from the comets, afterwards, to grow as much as possible, with a balanced growth, first creating all the pods and updating them in phases. One of my priorities after playing a couple of times was to acquire the insurance and the protection, and trying to adequate them to the threat coming in form of comets. For that I needed the information or research, therefore I was dealing all the time with the aforementioned trade offs. <br />One of the things I have learned is that we have to have information, provide at least a minimum of protection and insurance, and be quite proactive in order to avoid problems coming in the form of shocks. Whenever I had some time and money I was increasing protection and developing the community. Another thing is that connections between the different parts of the community are important in order to cope with problems, once they materialize. I do not know if this is linked to the game itself, but another thing is that once the community was quite developed, the problems were more bearable, shocks comparatively less important and the management of the game was less stressful (compared to the first levels of the game in which any comet with a high level of severity). <br /><br />Regarding the changes I would make : <br />- I would add several types of shocks, not only the comets, but also, for example, the amount of money you earn over time, can be dependent on other shocks like a financial crisis that diminishes the amount of money you receive unless you have been properly covered by an insurance. <br />- I would give more information to the player regarding how the income he receives is coming in order to improve the decision making process. <br />- I would change the way the game deals with the connections in the community. It is somehow time consuming and it does not add too much to the understanding of the problem (I mean, when you have been connecting the pods for a few seconds it does not add to the game to spend more time connecting them). On the other hand, I do not understand why the number of connections has to be increasing (we start with 2 connections, then 3, and so on).<br /><br /></div>
