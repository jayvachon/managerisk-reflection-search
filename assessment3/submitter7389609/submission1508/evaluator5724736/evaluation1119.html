    <div class="field-value">The reflection has nicely portrayed the learning from the game and how that learning can be implemented in real life. Also the writer has made a very good suggestion about what changes can be made in the game. The reflection could have been better if the writer described the game in less detail and concentrated more on the role of risk management in the game. Also the manner of presentation of ideas could be improved upon as its a bit difficult to understand what the writer is trying to convey.  </div>
