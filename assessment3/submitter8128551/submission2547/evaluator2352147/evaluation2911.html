    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is realizing that protection is important and it builds up as one goes along.

As outlined in the course material, and especially the videos, Risk Management has two components - Preparation and Coping. Thus, the statement - "Insurance is coping with the shocks" is incorrect.  Insurance is a component of Preparation. Knowledge, Protection, and Insurance are aspects of Preparation, and not of Coping. The reflection would benefit with clear understanding of Risk Management that preparation is combination of three actions, one of which is insurance, Insurance is like a cushion to shocks. Insurance is a hedge. Thus good preparation will reduce coping requirements, if and when, shocks manifest. However, coping is a different mechanism. It is recovering from the losses, given the the risk has already manifested.</div>
