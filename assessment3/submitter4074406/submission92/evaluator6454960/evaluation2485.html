    <div class="field-value">it is unfortunate the game didn't work out for you, but it is a free course with no tangible credit being offered - so all the effort put in is for the simple sake of learning. The forums had more information about help on how to make the game work, you didn't mention any effort of research through that option. Part of the MOOC concept is to explore these venues, instead of the traditional FAQ or help section. Nonetheless, the game is still up, you can go back and try it again for the sake of learning.

The game's intent was for you to learn to balance development of your city, with the risk imposed by the threat level of the meteor. Since each meteor had a different threat level, you had to apply your judgment wether to spend time doing research, spend money on insurance or protection. Otherwise, all your money would be spent on developing. What worked for me was to spend all my money at once on developing until the progress bar was green, research incoming meteors for at least a second, and spend time/money on protection for meteors according to their threat level. No money on insurance, the game modeled that really poorly. Once my progress bar reached the goal, and time was left in the counter, then I invested all my money in protection for the next level.</div>
