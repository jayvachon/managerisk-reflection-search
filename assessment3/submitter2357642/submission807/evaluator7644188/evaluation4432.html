    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is try to address The role of Knowledge ,Protection ,Insurance and Researches  to minimize the danger. The strategy he used  in the game was to get the highest insurance as fast as possible, However, In My opinion it was better his strategy to be matching the level of protection with the severity of Damage and then if the severity is so High he should buy Insurance that makes the reflection Better.</div>
