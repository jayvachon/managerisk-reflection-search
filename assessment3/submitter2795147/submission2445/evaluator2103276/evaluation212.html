    <div class="field-value">While reading the reflection, I am reminded of the almost the same experience that I went through in playing the game.  I think, this is the strength of this reflection: its ability to closely relate to the ups and downs that I went through in playing the game.  Maybe the one thing that may make this reflection better is to include some figures or quantities as to the number of attempts, the success and failures factors and how the dynamics are strategies that were deployed to reach level 2 and 4.</div>
