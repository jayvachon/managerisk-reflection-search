    <h1>Submission 1549 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7362376, session_user_id: 7c1ccabbb1917e597808c29daa44bdc2d57b79a4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the Risk Horizon games four times. The first three times, I did not make it to the second level... on the fourth try, I passed level 1 and failed level 2.<br /><br />Each time, I purchased the maximum insurance plan, and used the rest of my funds to build developments. I researched the incoming meteors -but did not allocate resources towards protection. I definitely underestimated the importance of "protection" and I ended using lots of funds to cover damages. Even though the premium insurance plan that I purchased covered most of the costs, once I had multiple expensive developments... even with the supplemental 75% from insurance, it was still very costly to rebuild.<br /><br />For me, the simulation certainly demonstrated the equal importance of knowledge, protection and insurance. I feel that I focused heavily on coping with loss --but did not do enough to prevent the loss from ever happening in the first place.<br /><br />I read through the instructions twice before starting the game --but still felt that it took the first two simulations before I really grasped the concepts and objectives. If I designed a second version of the game, I would reconfigure the threat. The meteors hitting the ocean causing rising water seems like an indirect threat... why not have meteors heading directly for the village? The information, research, and severity would certainly be more practical to the average user. Overall, I would prefer the game be structured around an idea of "development" that is less vague. Seeing the grass grow on the island.. and watching the meter on the left side of the screen felt very ambiguous. I like the idea of building roads or bridges in a town or city, and watching structures arise out of the increased capacity for commercial development.</div>
