    <div class="field-value">The author has presented his reflection well by describing his understanding rather than just explaining about the game. This is they key strength of this reflection. The language of the author is not clear which caused difficulty in understanding the essay properly. Hence, for better reflection, I think would be to review the language after drafting has been done.</div>
