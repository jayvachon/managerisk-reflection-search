    <div class="field-value">*What was the role of risk management in the game? 
you have to weigh between building new pods, buy solid and effective insurance, or advance in research and of course all of these directly affect your resources in different ways

*What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?
insurance was my first priority then became building to meet the level

*In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?
of course preparation save more money that could be used to update pods and make more money but after some time

*if you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time?
concentrating on preparation for comets impact rather than continuing building to protect my assets 

*What were the main things you learned from the game?
good risk management could bee cost money but give more benefits  </div>
