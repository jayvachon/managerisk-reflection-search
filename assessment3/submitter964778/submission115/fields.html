    <h1>Submission 115 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 964778, session_user_id: 8e2df96dd942601779d372c3403ee7b26908c845)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">If the game only was about building the houses and raising the money, It would have little to do with risk management. However, the asteroids screw everything over. If it weren't for the mini game when the planet is hit (I'd probably remove this and judge the amount of damage wholly on research), I'd consider the overall game a game of tradeoffs - I reached level 5 and got slightly too damaged by the last asteroid and could not reach the passing line.<br /><br />Preparation for risk affects in my case was mostly research and minigame avoidance (while the investment in protection was high all the time). Insurance, on the other hand, I found somewhat useless; repairs I could do, but since the last asteroid hits just before the time runs out, the evaluation of the result is somewhat biased; If I was still given some extra time, insurance would be of higher use (and I only got -17%, with plenty of money in the bank, max insurance on, but no time to spare).<br /><br />I played the game twice, first - to understand the concept, and then to get as far as possible. Before I understood how stuff works, it was harder to make good decisions, but after the first game - it got a lot easier.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, if I were the developer, I'd remove the minigame, as the actions during crisis, in my honest opinion, are somewhat not related to risk management, which is basically premeditation before the (un)likely event. The change might make the game more boring though..<br /><br /><br /></div>
