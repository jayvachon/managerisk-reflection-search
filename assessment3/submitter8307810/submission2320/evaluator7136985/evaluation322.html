    <div class="field-value">I find the concept of growth as a method to reduce risk interesting. This would be particularly important in the case of developing countries.

One thing, I feel, would improve the reflection is a more specific articulation of the impact of knowledge, protection, insurance and coping in real life, rather than just in the game. I feel you have touched upon interesting concepts, but haven't taken the time to expound upon them. </div>
