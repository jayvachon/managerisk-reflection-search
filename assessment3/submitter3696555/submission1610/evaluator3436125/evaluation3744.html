    <div class="field-value">I am of the opinion that the reflection above shows considerable understanding and practical application of effective risk management principles. The elucidation about the importance of strategy and evaluation of risk management strategies at the end of the game, is very laudable. I dare say that in the game and in real life, some people would be more interested in playing the next game to get a higher score or to move on to some other project; that learning from risk management outcomes would be put on the back burner. However I humbly opine that as the question regarding changes that the participant would make to the game was not really attempted, the opportunity to better showcase proficient understanding of the core concepts and reflection of risk management was missed. </div>
