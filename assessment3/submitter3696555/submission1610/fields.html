    <h1>Submission 1610 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3696555, session_user_id: 03de87c304cac48ef663e9570feeb0a2e163bdeb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>This is an outstanding, fun game which really illuminates many different facets of risk management and insurance. It conforms to the Week Two lessons which highlighted the Risk Chain (initial shocks, internal/external environments and outcomes) and the components of risk management (knowledge, insurance, protection and coping).</div><div>The game starts with knowledge. You must assess the probable damage that each successive comet may inflict on the communities you are developing and decide the most appropriate action to mitigate the risk. Based on the information provided to you concerning the severity, probability and research for each comet, you can choose multiple risk management actions. You can cushion the impact of each comet on the community by using the protection meter at the moment of impact, linking your communities or purchasing insurance at different percentage coverage levels. If the data suggests that a specific comet is not severe or has a low probability of inflicting damage, you may decide not to take any action.</div><div>This is one feature of risk management I would like to highlight. Many times a risk manager may feel compelled to intervene and take action. Some of the readings and lecturers advocate a very proactive approach to risk management; however, risk management often involves a very deliberate strategic or commercial decision. Sometimes the proper course of action might be delay, deliberation or even withdrawal. He who hesitates may be halfway home. In this sense, the aspect of the game where the player elects not to take action is instructive.</div><div>The game also highlights that risk management costs money and consumes resources; therefore, you better consider your options very carefully.</div><div>The game conditions you to balance your development objectives (measured in the left side meter and which is rewarded by promotion to the next level) with the potential environment damage and risks from comets. The trade-off between the growth of the community and the environmental threats is registered after each comet. The comet can miss or inflict a percentage of damage. If you have cushioned the impact or purchased insurance, the damage may be limited. You can ascertain whether you took appropriate risk management action after each comet and also at the end of the game. It is instructive to click on the icon for each comet when the game ends as it provides details on each risk management outcome.</div><div>Initially, I failed to appreciate the importance of building linked communities, accelerating their development and using the slide meter to cushion the impact of each comet. After viewing the tutorial I realized my earlier mistakes. After several times, I sensed the need to balance growth and development with potential external threats. I was focused on the horizon looking for the first signs of comets and then assessing the properties. I noticed that the data on each comet could change in the course of its trajectory. Also some comets moved at different speeds.</div><div>The one suggestion I would make is to emphasize the importance of reviewing the tutorial and playing the game a few times. The insurance is slightly confusing. Is it better to take out a policy early in the game? Does it apply to all comets or just one? I found it more effective to use the risk meter and control the impact.</div><div>The game may seem a bit confusing at first, but then it starts to become rather addictive. The model is quite instructive and may be adapted to other kinds of natural disasters (tsunamis, typhoons, earthquakes). The comet model provides for more knowledge application, probability calculation and bounded rationality.<br /><br /><br /></div></div>
