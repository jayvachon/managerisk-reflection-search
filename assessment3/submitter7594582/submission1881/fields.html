    <h1>Submission 1881 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7594582, session_user_id: 3dd256434b1b4c27c13cb65f5059b7e9ccad9cef)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b><u>REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME</u></b></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The Role of risk Management in the game
was to tackle the likelihood of shocks happening and their impacts. Thus to
combine the capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The choice of taking on risk and preparing
for it was appropriate because the benefits of paying in advance for
preparation exceeds the cost of paying for the damage afterwards. Indeed developing
and implementing risk management plan is cost effective.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Since the goal risk management is to
mitigate the losses and improve the benefits that people experience when they
face risk and opportunity one cannot compromise on the combination of these
three actions: <i>acquiring Knowledge,
obtaining protection and obtaining insurance. </i>However protection and insurance
may create synergies or require trade-offs.</span></p>

<p><i> </i></p>

<p>The quality of information with less ambiguity
leads to investment in early warning indicators and contingency planning to
improve emergency response which in turn complements insurance which serves as
a shock absorber.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Preparation for risk affects development
in the following ways</p>

<ul><li>Better knowledge inform decisions about investments in
     skills and education</li><li>Long term forecasting</li><li>Improve productivity</li><li>Improve investment</li><li>Introduction of new technologies </li><li>Resilience to shocks</li><li>Saves lives</li><li>Quick recovery</li></ul><p> </p>

<p>Thus with good preparation, only minimal
coping may be needed to recover quickly leaving more resources available for
investment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In the subsequent attempts, the following
were considered</p>

<ul><li>Effective plan</li><li>Implement the plan by embracing
     thinking and adopting a new way of working</li></ul><p>Lessons learnt upon reflective practice includes</p>

<ul><li>Risk is inevitable in
     development</li><li>Should be tackle head-on</li><li>Risk management is cost
     effective</li><li>Time management is essential in
     risk management</li></ul><ul><li>Effective and efficient planning</li><li>Broader thinking</li><li>Monitoring and evaluation (internal and external)</li><li>Patience</li><li>Be realistic</li></ul><p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The change I recommend is indicators for
risk in public place.</p>
