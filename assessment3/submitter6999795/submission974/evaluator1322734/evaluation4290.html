    <div class="field-value">In my opinion the key strength of this reflection is that " risk management should be done in an adequate amount to protect the assets developed, and simutaneously not being too afraid so goals canÂ´t be achieved. In order to catch up goals some risks must be taken ".

I think that more explanation about improvements suggested to be introduced in game (called " some population problem" in the speech )would the reflection better.</div>
