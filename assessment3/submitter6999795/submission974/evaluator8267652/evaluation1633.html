    <div class="field-value">Although the language of the student is not quite clear in all parts of the review, the ideas were brought over very well. All the 3 questions were answered. However, in the 3, the student could have been more specific about his/her idea of 'population problem'. It is vaguely comprehensible what they proposed to make the game more interesting. </div>
