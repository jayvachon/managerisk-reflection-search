    <div class="field-value">Detail is the key strength of this reflection. The game is played from a policy maker's perspective, hence the aggregation of views and the nudge to an overall risk-optimising behaviour. Still, the suggestion to incorporate diversity in individual behaviour is welcome. Didn't find anything on the equitable development encouraged by this game (multiple small structures  withstand damage better as against few skyscrapers ). Overall Impressive though.</div>
