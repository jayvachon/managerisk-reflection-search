    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of the risk management game was to make a player multi-task in contemplation, making preparation and taking action.  The risk that had to be taken was whether to take time to research, spend money on raising the village, spend money on insurance or spend money on building.  In the beginning I wasn't sure if I should build up one home large scale until completion and then continue to add another home at a time and build it up to completion, or whether to build all the homes at basic level and then build each home up a level as a group (aiming to upgrade them all to the same level at the same time).  I decided it would be best to use however much money I had to make any improvement to building new homes or building up the homes.  As it was cheapest to build a new home, if I noticed fast enough that I had just enough money to build a new home, I made that choice.  If my money had already increased enough to build up an existing home, I made that choice.  In the beginning I also waited for my money to increase to buy the best insurance as soon as I saw a threat coming.  After losing a level I changed my strategy and tried starting out by purchasing the cheapest insurance, and then focused to upgrade the insurance if multiple threats or a monster threat with high probability of hitting was approaching.  If I could change the game I would give the player pop up clues of what to consider when threats arrive or when the money in the bank increases, while they play in level 1 and 2 to help the player catch on to the strategies.  I assume and believe from making it to level 3 that the strategy is to build up as much as possible, and not keep much money reserve in the bank, until a threat comes and then money and energy should all be spent on upgrading insurance and raising the village.  Also the "research" part of the game was annoying to me because I could only focus on improving my research without multitasking to build homes and raise the village and/or upgrade insurance.  I realized that if I click to upgrade the homes before clicking on the threat to "research", then my home(s) would upgrade in the background at the same time while I gained research points.  It would be better if I could just do all these things at once and have them all open as pop-ups at the same time.  Also, it seemed that if I could memorize all the different insurance rates and different prices of upgrading the homes, then I could be quicker to make a decision to click on and activate these decisions as soon as I saw I had enough money in the bank.  But the funny thing to me is that in my real life, I would not be so concerned about "building up" (unless it meant it was providing better safety).  I'll assume "building up" in the game means that the buildings are becoming stronger and more durable to withstand disaster, and that it's not something aesthetic or more spacious.  Also in my real life, I would want to keep bigger reserve in my bank and be concerned to hold the best insurance policy at all times as earthquakes have no warning.  I wouldn't try to be constantly spending all the money in the reserve, which seems to be what a strategy of winning the game is.</div>
