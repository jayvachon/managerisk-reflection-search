The game and the manifestations of knowledge, insurance, protection were very well understood. I also completely agree that it is not realistic to assume that during research no other activity can be done and that there should be potential for multi-tasking during research.

What could improve?
It seems that you are over-thinking the bank/reserves aspect. Think of it as no use of keeping free cash; any money that does not go directly into "building up" (which is just a metaphor for development not bigger/shock proof houses) should be invested in managing future risks so that there are greater opportunities for development (before the next tidal wave/earthquake/attack/comet strike). Of course, it is our discretion that whether that money goes into insurance or protection etc. based on how much insurance or protection is enough (any less would mean we haven't prepared or coped well and any more would mean that money could have been better used for development)</div>
