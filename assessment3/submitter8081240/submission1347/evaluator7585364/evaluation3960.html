    <div class="field-value">There was a good, succinct analysis of the game.  The student has explained the processes and strategies he used during the game, and has also mentioned how difficult it was trying to mitigate against the risks given the limited resources.

However, I feel that there was not much application of what the student's experience with risk mitigation in general as a concept, besides the last sentence.  I feel that this evaluation would have done better with more analysis in this respect, and less description of what the student did in the game.  Furthermore, the student has not mentioned what addition or changes he/she would add in the game, which would have added to the overall reflection.</div>
