    <h1>Submission 1107 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2376838, session_user_id: 1a081788dc48cae833ea2721aeb1d78f28fac891)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) Risk management was important to protect the world of Alora from the loss incurred by meteors hits. I choose to maintain the development growing (building and upgrading pods) meanwhile increasing protection; when a meteor appeared in the horizon I would asses the likelihood of the loss by the severity and chance meters and decide either increasing insurance coverage or protection. Preparing for risk has an impact in development immediately while researching the meteor and making decisions based on the loss estimate.<br /><br />2) After the first time I was also focused in making the most of research points to gain more recovery time when a hit occurred. I learned that risk management is important to build a more resilient world and also support development..<br /><br />3) I would add inflation to the costs for buying (and repairing) new pods in the following levels. For example: in level 1, a brand new pod $200, in the next level (2) the same brand new pod would cost $250. I believe price changes over time would add a more realistic touch to the game, knowing that in today's society governments seeks to control inflation in order to protect the economy.</div>
