    <div class="field-value">Author of the game reflection did not comply with the requirement for the essay length of 400 - 600 words, whole reflection was 196 words only. Reflection itself have very little critical value and is mainly focusing on description of the experience of playing the game. Connection between the theory and game experience was not at the expected level, without needed references.
It is obvious that author have put some effort in preparing the reflection, however suggestion would be to approach reflection a bit deeper.</div>
