    <h1>Submission 582 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4480402, session_user_id: 62517d496ad49018c00233f98b53c45d00e8cc15)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>The role</b> of risk management game was to show that risk can be reduced and costs can be balanced through proper prediction, assessment, research, preparation, and mitigation. Two basic choices to make was to invest in development and in protection of the community. However, there were also some smaller dilemmas; for example, should I spend time raising the terrain to mitigate the result of the asteroid / comet impact or should I spend time preparing the community by conducting research that would give me extra time to prepare the community response. Also, there were choices which path of development should I follow: whether I should develop more capsules / modules on a lower level of development, or should I focus on developing and upgrading 3 or 4 modules to higher levels. Therefore, the game was all about choices and dealing with the consequences of those decisions.<br /><br /><b>I have played the game multiple times</b>. The first time, I was able to reach level 3, but during my consecutive tries, I was failing to go through level 2. Eventually, I discovered that I was playing too safe and that I was not spending enough resources on development by the beginning of each level. Then, when I tried to balance costs of development and protection (insurance, safety by raising terrain, and rebuilding), immediately I was more successful and I reached level 4 (or was it level 5 ?). However,<strong> I learned</strong> that at one moment, I was spending too much money on development, and if I was hit by a comet, I would have no money to rebuild the settlement. I was left with maybe 20 dollars and, despite having the insurance on the level of 75% payback, I would still have to have to cover 25% of the cost of rebuilding the community. Thus, the game taught me the importance of balancing between investing in development and in dealing with potential natural disasters. <br /><br /><strong>If I was to change one element of the game</strong> to make it better represent the risk management choices, I would try to make it more realistic and relevant. For instance, instead of taking place on a faraway planet, the game should take place somewhere in a developing country such as Bangladesh. There instead of meteors / comets, the player could be dealing with annual monsoons and other rains that could destroy the crops and endanger people's lives. Placing the game in such environment and context would make more sense in discovering what choices people in some place of the world have to make.</div>
