    <div class="field-value">Key strength I think is the persons idea for an update to the game, having experts provide advice to you.
The reflection would have been better if more detail had been provided in the answers. much of what was written was just restating the questions and not enough time given to their own answers. They had written enough so that I could see that they understood what the game was about, but not what they had learnt from it.</div>
