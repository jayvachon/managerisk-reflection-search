    <h1>Submission 2138 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1961795, session_user_id: 7b7e4bfe8f22a6f98ae199649520ff42ded847cc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>QUESTIONS 1</b></p>

<p><b> What was the role of risk management in the
game? </b></p>

<p> The role of
the game is to create understanding that the catastrophe events need to treat
with several conditions and the key issue is to have the right balancing.</p>

<p> <b>What choices did you make and what
trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?</b></p>

<p> I confront
all aspects like:</p>

<p><span>-         
</span>Knowledge with the past data of the impacts.</p>

<p><span>-         
</span>Protection: trying to reach the same level of
the impact.</p>

<p><span>-         
</span>Insurance: Covering the damages with the
insurance.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b> In
what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after
some time)?</b></p>

<p> Of course
the preparation for risk affect development, in both timing immediately and
some times.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><b>QUESTIONS 2</b></p>

<p> <b>If you played the game only once, what
would you do differently if you were to play it again?</b></p>

<p> If I do play
the game only once, I think I’ll focus more in the covering issues like
insurances and protections.</p>

<p> </p><p><b> Alternatively, if you played the game more
than once, what did you do differently after the first time? </b></p>



<p>The main
element for me if, I played for some times, is to have more accurate a really
scenarios of the impacts, and make better decisions of the tradeoffs of
development and risk covering. </p>



<p>Another
important point is not overestimate or underestimate the risk of the impact,
when you have the experience is more predictable.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><b>What were the main things you learned from
the game?</b></p>



<p>The things
that I really understood is to have the right balancing of development and risk
protection.  In the areas that the course
cover, like:</p>

<p><span>-         
</span>Knowledge.</p>

<p><span>-         
</span>Protection.</p>

<p><span>-         
</span>Insurance.</p><p><br /></p><b>QUESTIONS 3</b>



<p><b>The game captures, in a simplified way,
some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new
version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing</b>.</p>



<p>I will add,
some explanations or actions with the right button of the mouse, maybe if you
add some explanations to some events in the game, people can have better o more
engaging with the situations. Is like really world, sometimes you have advices,
from the experts, sometimes in the same directions, sometimes opposite
directions.</p>

<p> <b><br /></b></p><p><b>What change would you propose to better
represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</b>

</p>

<p>Maybe the
representation of a few animate cartoons claiming for live, Or something that
represent that if you fail, it will affects peoples.<br /></p><br /></div>
