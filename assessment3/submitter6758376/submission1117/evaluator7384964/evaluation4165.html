    <div class="field-value">I can't blame you. The game should work in most browsers, but you can be in bad luck. And even if it works, it may take some time to get the hang of where to click, drag, etc. I had a hard time in one particular part of the game where pods needed be connected by 'social links', which was almost impossible to do on my laptop without a mouse or touchscreen. I appreciate your attempts to play the game despite the technical difficulties, and I hope you appreciate that I gave you half of the points available for your effort. Good luck with the upcoming project!</div>
