    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>This game
plays a crucial part to me because it gives me a deep understanding about the
processes of risk management. Besides, shock may be avoided thanks to game’s
programming. In this game, I have to balance among insurance, protection and
knowledge to use time  effectively ,
build the pods as well as village. At the first times I played this game, my
strategies are quite stiff and inflexible due to lack of experiences. As a
result, time and money were distributed incorrectly, I wasted money on insurance
without hesitating although they are unnecessary, my manipulation was also
quite slow. After many faults, I realized that I had to change to adapt with
current situation, I started to concerned and researched on comets such as severity,
chance of hits and predict time of collision to had a wise choice among
methods. In higher level, the game went harder, concentration was must have due
to complicated development and the choice of method should be exact. For
example, I might apply “Insurance method” to buy insurance at medium cost for
my pods if did not have enough time to prepare and upgrade my village land to
higher level. In short, the lesson learned is we should have deep consideration
before choosing any methods such as copping, knowledge, insurance as well as
protection and apply it flexibly.</span></p></div>
