    <h1>Submission 1017 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8252198, session_user_id: f41becc8865b2e2bf8ff95bc511f25d0f3d0b6e3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.The role of risk management in the game is to use the resources like research,protection and insurance effectively (because everything costs)  to protect ourselves from natural disasters like comets,cyclones,floods,etc, to reduce the damage caused by those disasters.To win the game, i.e. to protect perfectly/completely without any damage from the natural disasters we should manage and use the available resources efficiently.Preparation of risk management saves life,money,property and also shows new opportunities which helps in the development.<br />2.I played this game many times.In the beginning i faced very difficult. After playing 3 to 4 times i am little comfortable with the game and i  successfully completed 2 levels.The first few times i didn't use resources properly hence in the beginning i lost the game.Later,i used resources efficiently by matching protection level,insurance and research with severity of the comet instead of spending excessively on resources without any measurement.I learnt how to protect ourselves from risks intelligently by using the resources effectively.<br />3.Searching for location to shift to places where there are  opportunities and no risks.If we don't find such kind of place then at least shifting to places where there are opportunities and have the ability to face the risks.  </div>
