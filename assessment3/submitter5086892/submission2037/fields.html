    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I engrossed myself fully in this game but still at third turn couldn't make any headway to reach level 2. I think either there is some technical flaw in this game or I couldn't understand as to how to play this game.I followed the instructions plus watched the demo but when I started to play it I couldn't make it to 2nd stage.<br /><br /></div>
