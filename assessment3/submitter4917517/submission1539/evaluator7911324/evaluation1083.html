    <div class="field-value">First, I guess you are not from English-speaking country. Since I am not from English-speaking country also, I understand that it is a little hard to keep the right English but I think it would be better if you concern more the grammar when you write down the essay. Soemtimes, the grammar can depreciate your whole work with creading difficulties of reading. I hope you are not bothered with my comments since this is my words from my own experience. 

I think you are very good at explaining every component of the game such as insurance and protection. Since some components cost a lot, it is important to select and concentrate based on cost-benefit analysis. In this regard, your essay explains very well how you selected and concentrated each component and what you gained in this process. Also, you are understanding that facotrs calculated from the forecast are important as well as factors which exist and you already know. I think this is very important key factor. However, if you made a more practical example related to the game such as other countries examples from our reading resources, it would be the better reflection. Thanks.</div>
