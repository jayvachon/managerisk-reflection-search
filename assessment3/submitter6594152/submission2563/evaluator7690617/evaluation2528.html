    <div class="field-value">Overall this is a solid reflection. The student has clearly understood the focus of the game and taken the time to genuinely reflect on his or her experiences. One of the strengths of this reflection is that it clearly links to some of the key messages in the World Development Report. To improve this reflection, the student should be more mindful of proofreading/ structure as parts of the reflection were difficult to read which detracted from the great arguments presented.  On a side note research does incur a cost of $5 each time a comet is clicked on.  </div>
