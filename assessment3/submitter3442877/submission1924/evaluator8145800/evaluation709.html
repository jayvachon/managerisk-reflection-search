    <div class="field-value">The game seems to be geared towards a younger crowd, which is fine on the one hand.  But as an adult Coursera participant, I think a less "action based" game would have been more helpful for understanding the course content. I don't know what the target age group was for this game, but it doesn't seem to match the probable age of the average Coursera participant.</div>
