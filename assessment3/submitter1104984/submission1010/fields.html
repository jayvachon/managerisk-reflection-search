    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">It is important to make in-depth study of the country's geography and the nature of its climate before starting a project or building a community for social development. The social and economic investment's chances for a long lasting success must take into consideration the following factors:<br /><ul><li>the nation's financial ability to meet the various costs associated with building such investment.</li><li>the scope of the preparations: financial, insurance, technical and human resources.</li><li>the role of the world bank in helping and offering assistance in case of a disaster.</li><li>the role of international community to assist in real time.</li><li>country's participation in an effective insurance system.</li></ul>These factors are very important in establishing an effective system of risk management. However, any nation must take into consideration the physical nature of its climate and land in order to reduce and minimize the negative impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. You need to build a stronger structure and better building code to ensure safety against the damaging effects of natural disasters.<br /><br />It takes a social responsibility and accountability to establish an effective risk management system. People at different level of national responsibility must work together to protect communities against natural events. For example, you don't build a nuclear reactor near an area that sits above an earthquake fault., or building factories near densely populated areas.<br /><br />Protecting the environment is an essential element in risk management. Deforestation is disastrous practice that leads to a great imbalance in the ecosystem. People must understand that they cannot go forever taking earth for granted. The best risk management starts with respecting the physical nature of earth.    <br /><br /><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
