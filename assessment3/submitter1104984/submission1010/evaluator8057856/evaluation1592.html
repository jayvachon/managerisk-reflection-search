    <div class="field-value">The reflection clearly understood the course and roles and impacts of all the players involved in risk management.

The reflection does not once, mention the game nor their experience playing the game. With all said abut the risk management, i would have liked to know how they played the game and their thoughts on it as well as what they would change on the game as stipulated in the brief.  </div>
