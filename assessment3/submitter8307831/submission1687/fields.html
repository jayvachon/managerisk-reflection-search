    <h1>Submission 1687 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307831, session_user_id: 73e159002579d596a00c38be80298abfb99df78c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game was to teach us, how to manage risk in a practical situation. The combination of the external and the internal factors in the game made the risk management an enjoyable challenge. considering that we need develop the land and protect it, bought the concept of risk management more clarity.<br />The choice was simple- the pod should be built in an regular platform(non rocky area). This gives an assurity that it has lesser impact when an earthquake hits, secondly ensuring sufficient funding and of course the timing. it was necessary that the game was in sync with the development and risk. Alora was frequently hit by comet which had a direct impact on water, which caused waves to hit the pod. Therefore it was clear that, not only the pod has to constructed and maintained, but also it has to prepared for the future risk with insurance which would reduce the risk by atleast 75%.<br />The game was certainly very difficult, but given one more i chance i would do more research and ensure adequate protection are considered would increase the height or the level of the land before the comet hit,and and build the pod, as away from the coastline as possible.<br />The most important concept i learnt about is how to manage risk in various different scenarios, and what different measures are to be considered to minismise such risks.<br />A better proposal would be to include the crews and also how that will effect the decision of the luminator. The time provided could have been extended. Also add one more luminator in the scenario and how that will effect the you as a player.Will the player help the other luminator in an unpredictive situation or would he protect his own?</div>
