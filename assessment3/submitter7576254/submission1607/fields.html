    <h1>Submission 1607 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7576254, session_user_id: 5c553bfb6c2a778c68a2c175dbcd01a837ada611)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game "<span>Risk Horizon" is nice short game to reflect how to do a simple risk management.<br />In order to succeed in this game, you need to "colonize" the world and always take in account measures of knowledge, protection and insurance.<br />Since, as in real life, resources are limited, you always need to make trade-offs - investments only on building hubs will lead to insufficient protection against disasters and lack of insurance will lead to critical loss without protection. All of this are depending on quantity and quality of the hubs in order to create "money". Preparation for risk is continious and can never be stopped since disasters are always possible.<br /><br />I played the game twice. In the first time I failed on the second level - I invested whatever resource raised on maximum protection and insurance (75%), most of the meteorites did not cause any damage (or small) but I didn't had enough hubs in order to raise the resources fast enough.<br />Only on the second game I implemented the knowledge of building hubs whenever it's possible. Also, Insurance is important but on what level?<br />I reduced the percentage of insurance to no more than 50% (from 75%). Last, protection, there is no need to raise the protection level to the maximum immidiatly at the beginning of the level, rasing to middle level and increasing it when necessary.<br />Also important issue is to invest time on meteor research since it's beneficial to reduce damage level to zero.<br />To sum it up, all the aspects of risk management (knowledge, protection, insurance): all of them are important and none of them goes alone.<br />You need to invest in everything by measure, have an insurance even if not full one, have a respectful protection levels but it can be huge waste of money to thrive for full protection, research is necessary in order to make the full use of knowledge and protection.<br />Lastly, Do not forget to reach for fast growth (build maximum hubs and upgrade it constantly).<br /><br />Last assignment is to propose one small change or addon. Since I live in a country that fights terrorism on daily basis, I would propose to add some sort of "Intelligence". In the contex of the game, it can be a way to predict how many, how strong and how frequent will be the (near) future threats. Such "Intelligence" can be helpful in order to create a general strategy for the harder levels.</span></div>
