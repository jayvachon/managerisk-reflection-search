    <h1>Submission 539 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5939857, session_user_id: f37d25d90d39791fd8b4d652f03acea41980971c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management is important in order to ensure that in case of any disasters, best of precautions can be taken in order to ensure that consequences of such disasters are kept to a minimum with respect to the citizens, infrastructure and overall of an economy. The first and best option and choice would be to ensure that basic steps were taken to ensure minimum safety precautions were taken. However once income began to come through, better and more development was taken like upgrading to better technology which explains that more investment in infrastructure resulted in better technology which in turn resulted in people being affected a lot. Even when affected, repairs and maintenance became less expensive because of the availability of insurance. Insurance in the game explained that even though maximum precautions were taken, the economy could still be affected and disasters cannot be completely mitigated but they can only be minimized hence we need to be completely prepared in case of any emergency. <br /><br />I played the game more than once. However on my first time, it was a little difficult as i was not too sure as to what had to be done. however after playing the game the second time, it became a lot more easier as I was aware of what were the major disasters and what the area was more prone to and what were the best ways that I could prevent the area from being affected to a great extent. Even when the area was affected, coping with the repairs and maintenance became easier as the community connections made it easier, which made it evident that if the community works together, coping with such events becomes much more manageable. The game also explains how to manage time and money as both are limited resources and proper management of them both is crucial.Making use of some resources such as land and developing it into a useful resource using adequate technology and investment would later have a good outcome which will benefit the economy at a later stage. Initial costs sometime s hinder people from believing that a certain technology could have a positive outcome hence it is necessary for people to be ensured that positive outcomes exist but are also very gradual. Doing a proper research on various disasters is a very important aspect in the field of risk management. Such as the severity of the disaster etc. Hence spending accurate amount of time in research is a good investment. <br /><br />Having insurance in the beginning also is another good move, as we are un aware of when disaster can strike, hence having insurance can come in handy at any point of time.<br /><br /></div>
