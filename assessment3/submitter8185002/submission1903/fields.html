    <h1>Submission 1903 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8185002, session_user_id: de7901f18992c7286666525beeefc7f8344001fa)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of Risk Management was fundamental for the developing of the game's community. The research was important to know what proporcion of problem was going to affect your community and also to create connections between the single entities, just like a kind of "insurance net". Protection is a strong mechanism to avoid a lot of damages and interruptions in the development of the community. Insurance was useful to face situations that the community could not afford with his own resources.</p><p>I played the game more than once and I have reached the 4th level only managing in an balanced way the various variables in the game, without thinking only in development and using the research as a way to prepare, prevent and protect. In my first attempts I wasn't using correctly the protection sistem, focusing principally in a rapid upgrade of the community, but every time that a big comet arrived I had to restart or pay for a lot of damages. It was pretty fun and it also gave me the possibility to understand how difficult is managing a community or something like this, there's always an obstacle that you have to prepare for.</p><p>I think that the game represents only the "noble part" of risk management, in other words you may lose the game because you didn't managed in a balanced way the mechanisms that you have in your hands, but not because you managed them in a bad way, like happens in the real world. The possibilities that the game gives you are only to spend in useful things the community resources, you can spend them for protection, that it's not bad, in research, insurance or development, but none of this things are bad. In a real country, a lot of times governments spend resources in totally unusefull things for the community, subtracting growt opportunities.</p></div>
