    <div class="field-value">Very simple but meaningful and straight expression of the game. The writer apparently has some writing talent, coherence, and style as well. He is obviously a risk professional as such he grasped the underlying meanings and goals behind the game in a very insightful way. Probably if he dedicated some more time to elaborate more he would be able to better align his insights to what we learned in the course, meaning in the same language, grouping, and expression. But for me this is immaterial. </div>
