    <h1>Submission 2052 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 450409, session_user_id: 49b7352936e2f1ef7b63a5a3975f7bb8560245ea)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game represented a simplistic (albeit enjoyable) version of risk management. As the game progressed the player needed to balance the potential detrimental effects of the asteroid hits with the continuing development of their buildings. A player could "research" an asteroid which would allow the player more time after impact to minimize the damage. This is a common concept in real life, the greater you understand the risk itself and its potential impact on your endeavors the easier it is to plan for that risk. Also by understanding the risk you can take advantage of times when the risks are minimal and brace for periods when the risks increase. The game continued in this vein by allowing the player to purchase insurance to reduce the cost of repairs that the players buildings would need in the event of an impact. This again is familiar to any property owner (e.g. car, home, commercial property), the amount of insurance you need is not just the general value of the property but what will be needed to replace the property in the event of damage.<br />Early in my first attempt at the game I concentrated only on building quickly to maximize revenue and "guarantee" my advancement. This strategy did not fair well, I was struck by several asteroids and was financially not in a position to cover the repairs to my buildings. After that attempt I used a more balanced approach, with every building came a purchase of insurance and an investment to "protect" (the little scale in the lower right) my building in case of a tragedy. I would then look for asteroids that would could do the largest amount of damage and spent the most time researching them to insure that I would have an opportunity to minimize their damage. This approach actually allowed me to progress to the 6th level (end of game). Also rather than spreading out constantly I concentrated at advancing the building I had so that I would be exposed to less financial strain in the event of an impact while still maximizing the revenue. I would have to say that the largest lesson learned form the game was to approach risk in a balanced manner, attempt to minimize the down-side while capitalizing on any opportunities.<br />If I was tasked with developing a new version I would expand it in several ways. First I would allow the game to be networked (so that communities could work together) allowing players to join together to offset some of the risks among themselves. Secondly I would introduce other potential opportunity vehicles, such as allowing for the player to invest in some form of asteroid "protection" that could negate an asteroids' damage all together. Finally I would allow for the carrying-over of insurance protection from level to level, thus making the game a bit more in-line with real world events,</div>
