    <h1>Submission 1598 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8213907, session_user_id: 39ab72d45eaf2d0eebc8771c65d98a450afa8721)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. The role of risk management in the game is to let us
relate the pods in the event that risk might occur in our community, how are we
going to be prepared and deal with the given concepts of disaster management. I
had to balance research, insurance and protection in order to keep my pods safe
from the comets; however, there were circumstances that it’s not always a
missed. Just like in disaster risk management knowledge, protection and insurance
should always be a combination to see it’s effectiveness. Although we cannot
always prevent a disaster, not only risk management is what we need, but how
people will cope after a certain adverse. Research takes a big part in obtaining
information for us to see the probabilities and judgments, and be able to come
up with the strategies how we are going to protect our community based on the available
resources and allotted insurance. Preparation for risk can immediately affect
development, for it will address and resolve issues as it takes place. It will also
help people’s capacity to respond in shocks, accompanied with support from the state
and the international communities in adhering the damages or loss that occurs. </p>

<p>2. I played the game more than once, I had to read the “How
to play” section twice for I didn’t pay attention to the instructions during
the “tutorial game”. It really takes a lot of balance to defend my pods; not
just an eye on the comets, but with the horizon as well to protect my pods.</p>

<p>3. I would propose that continuing education should be
evident to all levels of the society, information and resources should be available,
easy to reach and understand. One of the challenges of an effective risk
management is its implementation and how people can cope up. </p></div>
