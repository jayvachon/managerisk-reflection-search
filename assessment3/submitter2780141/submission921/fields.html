    <h1>Submission 921 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2780141, session_user_id: 0eda3625725f2618456ea833fd2103b81a08dcce)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I've read the instructions and played the game a few times but It seems to be a game of chance more than a game of skill. After the pods are damaged, the instructions state to drag and connect the highlighted pods to create  community connections but nothing happens when I do that.  <br /> <br />I have wasted two hours.  I can easily get to level 2.  However on two different computers I cannot get the silly research buttons to click on the comets more than one or two levels and the thing that is supposed to move you above sea level (claim it is a slider) does not appear to work the way the instructions say and linking communities - well never got that either.<br /><br /><span><br /><br /><br /></span></div>
