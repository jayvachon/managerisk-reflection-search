    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The purposes is pods built and upgrade pod to higher level
from 1 to 6 on time against comets. There are three choices for managing the
risk as;</p>

<p>- knowledge in research term by
getting comet’s velocity delay,</p>

<p>- protection preparing by holding
the bottom as long as the severity of the comets,</p>

<p>- insurance  purchased in high cost as amount of the
development done.</p>

<p>Trade off,</p><p>-  many building and upgrade pods are more
development cost, but it is more percentage of damage when the comets missed that insurance is paid by the development cost less,</p>

<p>-  comet’s information declared for getting the severity and chance of hit, including time delay by research
level. </p><p>Playing and strategy;</p>

<p>- trying to protect comets missed and  build more number of pods and update to higher level in order.</p>

<p>- Level of protection is higher and equal the
severity for higher illustrator in green by comets information.</p>

<p>- Purchasing insurance as chance of hit by guess to cover the damage.</p>

<p>- The main thing that I learned that there are no
damage occurred or less damage less than insurance purchased and always keep the illustrator green.</p><p>For difference playing;</p><p>-  Planning to arrange development cost for pods built and update, protection cost and insurance purchased.</p><p>- During the game, keeping comet's information is carefully investigated for getting more insurance and protection.</p><p>- Trying no pod damage happened, or few damage less than insurance for repairing the damage.</p><p>Lesson learning;</p><p>- planning and resource distribution are most important for pod's development, insurance purchase and research,</p><p>- community must be safe by protection,</p><p>- insurance has to prepared,</p><p>- research should be investigated</p><p>Conclusion, the resources should be divided in ratio by approximate and left some resource for the severity change to higher level and insurance in the future. </p><p>The development version;</p><p>- research effect should be more identify than the current version.</p><p>- pooling or cooperate insurance should be verified and before damage happened.</p><p>- highest level should be declared.</p><p><br /></p><p> </p><p><br /></p></div>
