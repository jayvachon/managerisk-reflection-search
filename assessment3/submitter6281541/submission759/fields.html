    <h1>Submission 759 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6281541, session_user_id: 6d52ba15b8ce64d0b812e3f6fefae5a095f89ef8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The whole game is generally about risk management and different aspects of it. While playing I had to maintain all the available actions simultaneously - build protection, research potential damage and probability of the comet impact, develop my community and decide whether to by insurance or not. There were several trade-offs I had to deal with,<br />First thrade-off was to decide where to put money in - to develop community or to buy insurance. On one hand the more fast I develop my community the more money I will gain when it would be upgraded. On the other hand if I put all the money in development and a damage from comet impact I couldn't prevent occurs than most of my houses would be destroyed and I will not have enough money to repair them quickly. Actually here I had to change my strategy while playing more games. While playing first couple of games I preferred to buy the best insurance just from the start and unfortunately that eventually resulted in loosing the game as far as I had no money to develop my houses. So finally my strategy was:<br />- on easy levels, when the comet damage is not too much, to put most of the money in development and not to buy insurance at all, or buy just the cheapest 33% contract. <br />- on futher harder levels I prefered to have Insuranse, but I tried to choose the correct moment to buy it. By the way - this is one of the things to improve in the game - in current version I can buy insurance just before the crash occurs. This problem is desribed in the course Reading assingment as one of the people's behaviour problem, when less prepaired people tend to buy insurance more than well prepaired one's, thus the cost of insurance have to variate whether client is well prepaired or not.<br />Another trade off i faced was how to decide what to do - improve my protection or knoledge given that it's impossible to do them concurrently. It took me actually several games to understand precisely how levels of research (knowledge) and protection define the following damage. <br />In first couple of games I first tried to build sufficient protection to prevent some middle-level damage, and after that put my attention to the sky to try to research some comets :)<br />But this strategy proved to be wrong as soon as some huge comet appeared it the sky, and both my protection was not good enough and my small amount of knowledge about it's possible impact didn't allow me to decide whether I should improve protection or not. Here eventually I find out best strategy was to do all the things at the same time - for every comet in the sky I did some research (while the level of knowledge reached 3-4 bars on progress bar) and the rest of time spent on protection. If according to my knowledge about the coming comet there was no chance to prevent damadge by protecting - I bought insurance.<br />Finally another trade off was the following - how to spend money - to develop the community or just to keep them as money, just 'in case', if something happens. This was some kind of bias - first I thought that I'm developed enough, so I just earned the money and kept them safe. But it was my mistake - eventually I learned that pure money are almost useless - I had to use them to develop in all possible ways - to develop, to acquire knowledge and insurance and to build protection. Doing these things I managed to survive and even to earn much more money :)</div>
