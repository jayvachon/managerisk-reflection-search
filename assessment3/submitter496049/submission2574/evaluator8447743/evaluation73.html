    <div class="field-value">In my opinion the student being evaluated was able to develop a feasible strategy for the game which enabled him/her to finish all six levels successfully. The reflection involves a clear explanation and shows understanding of why this particular strategy worked. By the end of the reflection it is apparent that the author chose protection as the main means of risk management, which enabled the player to succeed in the game. I also liked the idea for game improvement. Introduction to more types of risks can indeed make the game more realistic and challenging. Overall I think that this reflection is comprehensive, clear and well written.

As for the negatives, I think tradeoffs between the different gameâ€™s options were overlooked a bit. More evaluation and analyses of tradeoffs between risk management and development, as well as those of different risk management types might be included. It could be stated, for example, that heavy investment in protection eliminated the need of high research and insurance expenditures. It should also be highlighted that high protection made coping easier, as in most cases crisis was avoided. Fewer damages then led to more money available to invest in further development and enabled to hit the development target. I think that paying a bit more attention to all risk management techniques, rather than just protection, could make this reflection even better.
