    <h1>Submission 2519 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6130695, session_user_id: b610a169f977f38f91963930f869d6b51af74c03)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">An effective risk management needs to combine capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards. We need to prepare by collecting information and judging it to acquire protection and insurance. This would help us in minimizing losses and coping in the aftermath of a crisis. I had this background in mind when I started playing the game of developing the community But with comets falling the community was posed to a great risk of getting damaged and destroyed. I had the advantage of collecting research knowledge on the comets and thus could judge when to apply for protection and insurance. As the game progressed, I realised I had to apply my research to the situation to reap from it. Just doing research and not using that information to our benefit is a waste of resources. I chose to raise the level of the island when the comet was more severe and took insurance to minimize development costs in the aftermath of a comet hit. Sometimes, when I was in a hurry to build and upgrade my pods fast, I realised my funds would get all used up and I had no way of upgrading insurance or taking higher protection. <br /><br />I played the game twice. This time around I spent more time on accumulating more research, thus giving myself more time and advantage in creating additional community connections and therefore enhanced protection before the comet hit. I judged that some comets were of severe intensity and needed higher protection and insurance. So I accordingly bought 3rd plan of insurance to save on re-developmental costs and kept on taking the island higher for protection against the waves. Not letting my funds deplete completely was a challenge as also the frequency of risks(comets hitting) increasing at higher levels. All in all I learnt that a healthy balance of knowledge, protection and insurance is essential for coping mechanisms to be effective.<br /><br />I would improve earthquake disaster management measures in my high-rise complex as we are staying in a earthquake prone area.. Proper information to be made available in terms of dos and donts to all the apartments/people in case an earthquake occurs. Protection in terms of clean passageways in fire fighting staircase and safety drills to be practised compulsarily on Sundays for all the people including women and children . Efficient alarm messaging systems to be installed so that everyone gets forewarned and advised for further action. Also advocating insuring buildings and homes to reduce re-development costs in case of damage. Having medical insurance with nearby hospitals for group treatments in case of a crisis. All this preparation would help better manage the damage and loss if an earthquake occurs.Measures like this can be incorporated in the game<br /><br /><br /></div>
