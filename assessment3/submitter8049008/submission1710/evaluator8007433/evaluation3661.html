    <div class="field-value">This answer give very clear idea about role of risk management in the game as well as the choices he/she have to make and trade-offs that he/she confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance with the clearly explanation by using the simple words. So, it help the reader to understand his/her answer easily. Furthermore,giving the answer by using the bullet  point  can make the answer more attractive because the answer is not just the explanatory and elaborate thing. I also agree with the last answer that " he/she would introduce some aspects of coping with the risk - either through evacuation when the risk is eminent. But one thing that he/she should improve is the last answer should have more detail on how to developing a new version of the game not only giving the isolate idea. </div>
