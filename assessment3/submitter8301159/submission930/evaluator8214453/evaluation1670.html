    <div class="field-value">This player observed that gameplay of this game differed depending on which browsed he used. After reading this reflection, I played this game once again using Fireforx and found out, it was much more easier to rise protection bar, thus more easily protect my community. Although this has an impact on experience of playing this game, and should be corrected, this does not affect the decision you take while playing it. Thus, the role of risk management is still clear in my view. This player describes clearly what are the objectives, and how he understands elements of risk management in this game. For instance, he observed, that doing research on the meteors, give a player not only the knowledge, but the opportunity to make connections (this is meant as "community") It means, this player spent time to make sure he/she uses different means of risk management. 
What is more, this player reflects on what happened, after playing this game more times. He found out that insurance is always useful, no matter how severe can damage be. Although I believe, this is relevant implication, I would be interested in other strategies, choices he/she made.</div>
