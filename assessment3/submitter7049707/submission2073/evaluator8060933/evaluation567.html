    <div class="field-value">This reflection shows that the writer understands how important it is to prepare against risks whether by gathering knowledge or getting insurance very well. Describing the reactions made by the writer and learning from mistakes shows a very good effort.

The reflection had some problems though: protection was either barely mentioned or completely neglected (I found it hard to understand whether "the more you are prevented from it, so you become able to diminish the effects or damages" was talking about protection or not but is the only thing i saw possibly mentioning protection so protection was not very well explained. Few points were unclear and I could not exactly understand them so this affected clarity score.

To the writer: I can see that you have a bit of problems with English and that affected your reflection a bit. However, it is clear that you have put a good amount of effort in this reflection which matters more than anything else. with some adjustments you would have a great piece of writing.</div>
