    <div class="field-value">I believe the key strength of this reflection is that the student realized that the risk could be manage in some way if the community have the tools and the resources to face the different risks that a community might have. 
I believe the student should have played more times in order to achieve more levels, because he might learn a little bit more how to manage the resources that the community had, because sometimes you have to face the risk with the constraints that you have.
