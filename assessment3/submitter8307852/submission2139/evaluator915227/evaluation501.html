    <div class="field-value">The thoughts were very well connected and all the points were covered comprehensively to describe the role of risk, protection and insurance in the game. A few points were very well explained. I particularly liked the point on how you would improve if given an opportunity to play the game again.

But a few points were logically inappropriate for e.g. 'Insurance protection could minimize chances of being hit' is not true. Also, a better reflection on the ways you would improve the game and the how you would implement the suggested changes within the game would have been better way of explaining.

Overall, well written but there is lot of space for improvement if you practice more.</div>
