    <h1>Submission 858 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7801843, session_user_id: 6279d4897899deadbdd8a5736987f337b81f2e2a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in this game was in realizing
clearly what I want to achieve in development of the area, identifying risks that
are specific for this area and planning how to prevent negative situations or
at least mitigate the consequences. The important part was considering how much
money we have and then prioritizing what is important to do immediately and
what can do later. This game also wanted to show us that for making right decision
and prioritizing we need to have enough information. However sometimes we do
not have enough information and we have to think ahead and try to predict
possible risks and opportunities.</p>

<p>I had to make a trade-offs when I was considering if I
should do more development or if I should better to pay more attention to the protection
and the prevention of risks. I also had to take into account how much finance I
have and what kind of insurance I can pay. Then I had to consider what option
is the best if to buy the most expensive insurance immediately or wait a bit until
I make more money so I can afford it. I had to think about my budget when I
wanted to buy an insurance and at the same time I had to pay attention to other
things what were happening on my planet. I needed to stay focused on the big
picture and all connection all the time.</p>

<p>Preparation for risk affected development in positive way.
Thanks prevention I reduce occurrence of negative situations and threats or at
least mitigated negative shocks in cases that I could not to avoid a dangerous
and negative situation – this was an immediate effect of preparation for risk. Knowledge
helped me in decision making. Insurance mitigated negative aftermath of shocks
and destructive events, so I could survive crisis much better and with better
insurance I had shorter recovery time – this was an effect that I could see
after some time. </p>

<p>When I played the game second time, I was much more aware of
risks and of what is the appropriate behavior for such a risks and situations
that were on my planet. I think that is also important that a developer (risk
manager) has already some experience with a crisis, so he does not waste a time
and money. The main thing for me, when I played second time, was realizing that
I have a limited budget and I have to carefully consider how I will spend a
money. Another thing was realizing that investment in development makes money,
so I can get more resources that way. The main thing I learnt was importance of
seeing the big picture of situation and paying attention on all details in the
same time. The game showed that risk management has more benefits than costs.</p>

<p>If I could add one simple thing to the new version of this
game I would upgrade a community function. I would add there some shelters and
in case of emergency people would receive an alarm notice and evacuate
themselves. So more people would survive and be ready to collaborate on
community development.</p>

<p>I live in the Czech Republic and I think that my country needs to focus on risk management for finance threats
that face households. In my opinion risk management for systemic finance threats
is sufficient, however there is still space for improvement. I would suggest steps for increasing of financial intelligence of households.</p></div>
