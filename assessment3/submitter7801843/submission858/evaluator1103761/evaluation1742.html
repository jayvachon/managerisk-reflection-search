    <div class="field-value">In this case, the key strenght of the reflection is that risk management needs to attend some obstacles as the lack of resources, money, information, to be effective. Also that even if it can be difficult to manage risks, we gain more investing in it, that not investing. In this case, the reflection of the game was mainly based on the personal experience of my classmate. If I could improve anything I would put the main ideas on the management of risk extracted from the game, in connection with reality and with other theoretical aspects we have learned during the course. Because even though the game is representative of reality, does not include all the complexity of the process studied.</div>
