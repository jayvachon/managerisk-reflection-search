    <div class="field-value">Your reflection is very clear and comprehensive on the tradeoff between insurance and building activities, and also the importance of savings (when times get worse, or you move to the next level). It is very interesting how you relate all this to real life. What I missed in your reflection is an evaluation of the pros and cons of investing in protection. You could chose to spend resources on increasing protection in 'good times', or spend all these resources on building. Meanwhile you had to chose between spending your time on holding the protection key (right below) or on researching the asteroid approaching. Remember, this research could give you the opportunity to have more time (after impact of an asteroid) to create 'connections' which also increased your protection / minimizing the damage of impact (just for that impact once). Your reflection did not make clear what your strategy was to that tradeoff.
Overall very well done!</div>
