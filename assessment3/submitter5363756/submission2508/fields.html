    <h1>Submission 2508 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5363756, session_user_id: ce9f96c59420472186899d86918286b5dd6fb037)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The objective of the game was to meet the developmental
goals, whose difficulty increased with increasing number of level. The role of
risk management was central due to two reasons, firstly without it the
developmental targets could not be achieved and secondly to prepare for the
damage caused by falling comets. The game provided with three kinds of powers
to the player, the power of protection, the power of research, and the power of
insurance, each corresponding to protection, knowledge and insurance respectively.
In the games I played I gave the utmost importance to research, the knowledge
gathered through research helped me make decisions regarding risk management. Knowing
the level of severity of the disaster along with the probability of the comet
to hit the Alora allowed me to make decisions regarding funds allocation.
Higher chance and severity indicated the need for more funds for recovery after
the disaster. But by choosing research I did a trade-off on protection which in
the later stages caused me to suffer due to high level of severity of hitting
comets. While preparing for risks I realized that development in the shorter
period was delayed but in the long term development was ensured through
effective tackling of the risk.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><span>If I were to play the game again I would prefer to spend
more of my resources on protection and insurance. The rationale behind this
choice will be that the long term costs that one has to bear in the absence of
protection and insurance outweighs the cost one has to incur in buying
insurance and developing protection measures. Keeping this in mind after the first
time I gave more importance to protection and insurance. The lesson I learnt
from this game is that risk management is all about maintain a delicate balance
between the utilizing resources in all thematic areas of preparation that are  knowledge, protection and insurance, each with
its own safety net against the damage caused by risks and the limitations to
handle the crisis situation. So it helped me realize that risk management is a
process in which one tries to avert the negative consequences through conscious
decision making between various options, which sums up to be how we cope with
the possible risk.  </span></p>

<p><span>Improvement on such a well developed game reflecting various
aspects of risk management seems to be an arduous task.  The room for improvement is very small as the
game addresses all the interlinked components of risk management. Given the
situation in the place I live and the risks we face as a community I would like
to add a component that would help develop the concept of shocks varying due internal
and external conditions and with a variety of potential outcomes. </span></p></div>
