    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Reflection -</b> <b><a href="http://riskhorizon.org">Risk Horizon</a></b><a href="http://riskhorizon.org"> </a><b><a href="http://riskhorizon.org">Game</a></b> </p><p>The role of <b><i>risk management</i></b> in the <a href="http://riskhorizon.org" title="Link: http://riskhorizon.org">Risk Horizon</a> game was to learn to <b><i>mitigate risk</i></b> in preparation for an event where falling meteors could <strong><em>cause real loss</em></strong> through damage caused by rising sea levels to waterfront pods (homes). Preparation was required by the player to <b><i>defend</i></b> against the oncoming damage with the <b><i>limited resources of funds and time available</i></b>. Because the resources were limited the player needs to work out how <b><i>activities needed prioritising</i></b>.</p>
<p><b><i>Risk management</i></b><i> c</i>hoices I made during the game were to monitor and conduct <b><i>research</i></b> of the meteors <strong><em>chance</em></strong> of impact and <strong><em>severity</em></strong>, take out <b><i>insurance</i></b> against damage, build <b><i>protection</i></b> by raising the elevation of the settlement from sea level and <strong><em>strengthening the communities</em></strong> and perform structural <b><i>upgrades</i></b> to the pods.</p>
<p></p><p>Trade-offs confronted me in terms of the time it took to acquire my <em><strong>knowledge</strong></em> "<i>actions to improve understanding of possible shocks and their potential outcomes" </i>as well as perform other activities. The cost to create <strong><em>protection</em></strong> <i>"actions to reduce the probability or magnitude of losses from negative shocks, or to increase gains from positive shocks" </i>by building up the land, repairs after meteors hit and buy <strong><em>insurance</em></strong> <i>"actions to transfer resources from good to bad times, or to those most in need in bad times" </i>were an issue because the funds and time available were defined and limited therefore priorities had to be identified.</p>
<p>Preparation for risk affected development immediately as there was a delay to acquire then construct improvements then the cost of development was restricted by the funds available.</p>
<p>I played the game more than once, I restricted the number of pods I added after my first experience and paid for insurance and protection and upgrades to the pods. The main things I learned from the game was that activities needed to be identified then prioritised. Insurance is not a priority if there are no pods. Research proved to be the most important activity with protection and upgrades being very useful.</p><p>If I was tasked with developing a new version of this game I would add <i><b>characteristics</b></i> that offer more detail such as "<i>character</i> <i><b>images</b>; portraying what the community connections do or provide</i>" or the change I would propose to best represent the place were I live in the risk management choices would be have the meteor path cross the <i><b>Southern Cross</b></i> star constellation which is an Australian icon.</p>
