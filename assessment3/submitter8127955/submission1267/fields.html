    <h1>Submission 1267 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8127955, session_user_id: 76959269e220138ba43750e682494aeb8c6a6ee9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">from what i understand during the project stages you will be under risk of damages and stop the production you need to check the probability of the risk to be happen and how much damage will occur and prepare your self by spend money on insurance and protection and you need to prepare immediately  ,and i play the game more than one time i notice i need to check the severity of the risk and chance to hit (stop the project)<br />and i need to make in mind the maintenance expense ,developing expense and insurance expense .<br /> i think the damage should not be equally as you can fix the less damaged first in case you have not enough money so you are back on the track and production continue  so more money will help to fix the others .<br />also i cant go for the higher insurance from the first time as i need the money for the development .</div>
