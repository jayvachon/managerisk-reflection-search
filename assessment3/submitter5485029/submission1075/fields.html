Managing Risk for Development</b></p>

<p><b>Nicolás González</b></p>

<p><b>12/07/2014</b></p>

<p><span>The role of risk management was to create a
city and develop it without being completely destroyed by meteors, this risk
management was implemented in various ways and the user had to have skills to
cope with side effects of the tragedies that threatened, the options I use to
face the risk of the best way was to use insurance for the reconstruction eventhough
it was very expensive and does not allow a faster development of Alora, this
was for me the most important that had to be done, because the city needed to
be reconstructed when another meteorite crashes, the second thing was using the
research of meteorites for giving  some
time for the city and preventing that was completely destroyed, finally raise
the land was my last option. </span></p>

<p>Preparing for the risk involves a slower
development of the city, since being insured has a very high cost and revenue
was not very large, that’s why in the beginning of each level my intention was
to insure before the impacts of the meteorites. However, knowledge of
meteorites was not as expensive as insurance and when you see one the frame it
was important to have all the knowledge about this to mitigate risk, although there
were a few which had little chance of hitting, but in fact expenditure in
knowledge, protection and insurance prevented the rapid evolution of the city,
although the risk was mitigated and Alora can easier face tragedy.</p>

<p>When playing the game for the first time the
user wants to have everything under control and this means taking all measures
against disaster. And therefore, under my criteria, I think the most important
move in the game is insurance to focus on the reconstruction because it becomes
cheaper and you can continue the development of the city. Because of this, in
the next occasions that play this game I'm going to focus more on the
reconstruction of the city to deal with the tragedy in the best possible way. </p>

<p><span>If I could have the possibility to change risk
management measures in the place where I live I would start by allocating more
funds to the relocation of people victims of these tragedies, it is important for
these people to  have incentives to move
to a safer place because if there are no incentives people will rather stay in
those places prone to tragedy and if I could make one change to the game I would
seek that the small community of Alora have incentives to relocate to a less dangerous
place than the current, and that would be the purpose of the game.</span></p></div>
