    <div class="field-value">the analysis of the balance of development and protection being a key for a secure continuous growth,  leading to reducing much of the negative impacts of a shock was a very strong point in your argument.
Pont number 2 was not diversly exploited as in what you could have done differently in the game. One argument was perhaps a bit confusing and could need a bit of improvement on clarity or use an example as to clarify your point. I am referring to this: "And even we have a much recourses to cost for damages it will not lead to a favorable outcome, if the development and protection did unbalanced. We should be to keep save the communities from negative outcomes and if the protection is high there will be less damages or nothing."</div>
