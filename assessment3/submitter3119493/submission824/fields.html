    <div class="field-value">Risk Management plays a predominant role in the worlds environmental development.There may be natural disasters and natural calamnities but a country that is strong in  disaster management is the strongest to face any sort of risk that may come on the way. A country needs to be well protected from any sort of natural disasters and this can only be protected by means of insurance. A timely insurance covers the entire risk at the time of natural calamnities and disasters. There may be tidal waves, earthquakes, floods due to heavy and incessant rain , destruction by fire and other uncertain circumstances. Protection from uncertain risks is a bare necessity. A country needs to take enough protection for the safety of the environment after taking into account the climatic condition and the suitable environment that needs to be present in all respects. A country needs to change from the point of climate, economy and financial strength to overcome all the risk and difficulties  that may come on the way. In this respect it is insurance that plays a vital role in protecting the country from natural disasters .The insurance company assesses the weight of such disasters and protects by way of compensations. Until the risk is covered fully by way of insurance whatever the loss may have incurred will be made good by the insurance company. It only needs a timely assessment of the loss suffered and made good the loss so as to bring peace to the community and the world at large. Risk management thus needs much importance for facing unforeseen difficulties that may come in the way. It is also important to say that risk management indeed is very helpful and advantageous if it can be rightly handled at the right time and at the right situation. One has to understand and study the density of the situation that may arise due to the natural disaster and that too without fear. It is the independent decision of the experts who are engaged and specialised in world disasters and who can easily predict as to when and where such natural calamnities may occur, To overcome such risks , it needs to gather knowledge in a much wider scale, it needs to be well protected to ensure that such natural disasters may not arise in future and it needs to be well insured to the fullest so that any sort of natural disasters that may occur may be covered and compensated with proper assessment at the right time and at the right place. A country's prosperity depends much more on the efficient risk management which is the need of the hour. A close watch and good observance is needed to see that a country is well protected from any risk that may come on the way. .Insurance plays an important role in determining how much loss has or may have incurred when there is every probability of compensating the loss so that the good may be restored in due course of time. Thus, in the light of the above discussion, I come to a conclusion that it is knowledge, protection and insurance that plays a very important role in fighting out the risk and disaster  that may or may not arise. If there is no such natural risks and disasters, the country is saved but if it does occur, it needs immediate protection by way of insurance at the right time for the benefit of the community as a whole and the world at large .It is insurance that will give full protection from such risk and compensate in due course .</div>
