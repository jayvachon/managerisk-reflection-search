    <h1>Submission 483 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7656146, session_user_id: e02dcf432a8f766b547a580194fbe6e605101423)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management meant everything in the game! and I must say I really had fun playing Risk Horizon and I am sure I will be playing more of it as well as introducing my friends and colleagues to it, it'll sure be a 'soft way' to get them to learn about risk management. Firstly, you had to develop your community to the best of your abilities which is a necessary concept in risk management as you have to properly build the foundation. This is same as the positive risk we take in sending our lovely kids to great schools and providing them with sound education. After this, a person playing the game has to ensure that he or she optimizes the level to which they want to develop their community, will you be developing the entire community? or just as much as is necessary to realize optimal gains?. This is a very important risk management concept that the game teaches because of the cost limitations suffered by individuals, households and small communities. The game teaches us that we can't buy 100% insurance or the highest level of protection all the time especially when you are just starting out but you can build on what you have in a step-wise manner this could be achieved by collaboration between individuals, communities, government intervention etc. Another important risk management concept the game teaches is the ability to recognize risk and also evaluate it to determine your risk response and requisite preparedness. In the game, the risks level was depicted by the comets severity, its chance of occurring and the protection level required to cope after it crashes. The player uses this info to ''ramp up'' and decide how much protection or insurance is required to save him and his household from the comet's negative effects.<br /><br />I played the game so many times! and I learnt at least one new thing every time I started a new game. At first, it was hard to get past stage 1! I then decided to  dedicate more time to understand the concepts and acquire the ''knowledge'' necessary to best defend my community. As soon as I understood what I had to do to survive I started to reach stage 3 and 4 nearly effortlessly. The game taught me to understand the risk, analyze the risks for possible ways to prevent it from occurring or at least reduce the impact if it did occur.<br /><br />If I was tasked with developing a new version of the game, it would be nice to include some real-life occurrences like introducing a hospital that charges a  high fee for treating victims of the community who were totally unprepared for the comets and so are badly affected by its destructive effects as against community members who took the necessary precautions to avoid the risk and therefore do not require to pay this fee, But I must add that the developers of the game must have really put a lot of good thinking into the games development as it is a very fascinating, as well as an educative game that teaches the core concepts of risk management.<br /><br />I have to go now, back to risk horizon! more learning ahead............I wish you all the best throughout this course and also in your personal life and your career.<br /><br /> <br /></div>
