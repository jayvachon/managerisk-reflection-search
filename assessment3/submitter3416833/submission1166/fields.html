    <h1>Submission 1166 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3416833, session_user_id: 19075ffb83b18d389d5694edb8ad214210d863cd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management is very important in this game, it helps to identity the damage severity , prevent from damage or recover from damage, all of them leads to better development. I have used all methods available in this game for risk management , which are research, protection and insurance. <br />Research (or knowledge) helps to understand the damage severity and chance of hit, when there are multiple shocks coming , I need to make decision on which shock I spend more on. The more time I spend on research in one shock, the more time I earn after the shock really hits so that I can make connection with my community , this will increase protection level. Sometimes I spend much time on low chance but high severity shock, but it does not really hit, I still feels it is worthy of time , since I am not overconfident. Protection is another method which consumes both money and time, but it has long term effect, so I  always do this when I am at the interval of development (building pods) and research (watching the comets). Insurance helps to recover quickly from damage and usually saves money when damage causes significant loss, it is extremely important at the beginning when I do not have enough money or protection level. As I increase my protection level , I may spend less on insurance and more on development, but it is always good to keep some level of insurance.  As a conclusion, research (or knowledge) usually plays an immediate role, protection and insurance usually plays a long term role in risk management preparation.<br />I have played this game for several times. At the beginning ,I did not spend any time on research , I raised my protection level a bit, and I am heavily relied on development and insurance . I was hoping that quick development can help me to achieve my goal quickly, but I could not even make it to level 3 without proper risk preparation. Then I adjust my strategy,I spend more time on research to understand the damage severity and chance of hit, and I can raise my protection level according to the coming damage severity.  By doing this, I find I can always keep my community to "no damage" when I am fully aware of the damage severity and protection level, as a result ,I have gained better development . I can also spend less on insurance when I am better prepared, so I can put the same amount of money into development which also leads to better development. So the most important thing I have learned from this game is that I need to understand my risk , prepare better to control risk and prevent from damage instead of trying to recover from damage, since the latter one always costs too much more than the previous one.<br />In real world , small companies are more likely to suffer from risk , merge or acquisition always happens.For individuals , marriage helps to concentrate resource to prepare for risk. If I can add one thing in this game, I would like to add one feature to merge small pods to become a larger one or have the large pod to acquire the small one to become a even larger one.<br /></div>
