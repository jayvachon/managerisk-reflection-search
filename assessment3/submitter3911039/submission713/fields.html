    <h1>Submission 713 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3911039, session_user_id: 8c2fbabaeb35f07612650bc763859de30a6587d2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The major task that I had to accomplish was to keep the development progressing while preventing as much damage from the comets as possible. Risk management in the game was to use research, protection, and insurance appropriately to keep the pods safe from shocks (the comets), and to cope with the aftermath once the disaster stroke. At first I thought this game would be easy, but it turned out to be very challenging.<br /> Upgrading buildings, conducting research, and raising ground levels required a lot of time, but some of the most powerful comets fell quickly. So after numerous failures to reach level four, I figured out I had to provide protection as fast as I could, when I had enough time and money to spend. Preparation was late when shocks were already imminent. Time was one of the biggest constraints, so I had to act fast to prepare, and act fast to set things right. But I couldn't spend all my time preventing shocks because I had to meet certain levels of development. Time management had been the most difficult task for me.<br /> Another challenge I faced was money. At first I always bought insurance, but after I bought the insurance I lacked money to develop the pods, so I couldn't make it to the next level. In some levels, I didn't even need insurance so I just wasted my money unnecessarily. But at the same time I couldn't cope with disasters easily once they caused severe damage. The upgraded pods became increasingly difficult to recover from shock once they were damaged. After the damage I actually lost a lot of money and fell behind in a blink of an eye. The higher the level became, the more costly everything became also. However, I had to keep on with the development of the pods because upgraded pods produced more income so that I could pay for necessary precautions.<br /> In my last attempt, I reflected on my realizations and only bought the cheapest insurance (and bought them only when I expected serious damage caused by comets), spent most of the money building/developing pods, and did everything to prevent the damage once the pods were upgraded.<br /> Preparatory measures were effective in reducing damages caused by shock, however, obtaining knowledge required time, providing protection was costly, and insurance sometimes became a waste. Planning for further development, investing money, and deciding to do what's best for the time being had all been risky from time to time. Deciding what was necessary, and deciding what was appropriate was the key to successful risk management.<br /> If I can develop this game further to fit the situation in my country, I would include "education of citizens". Our country is exposed to severe damage caused by shocks, not because there are a lot of natural disasters, but rather because there are too little of them. People are unaware of what disasters would bring, because people in our country weren't much exposed to catastrophic natural disasters. With global warming and the shifts of tectonic plates, however, earthquakes are occurring much more frequently, and rainfalls are becoming increasingly unpredictable. To lessen the future damage that is most likely to occur, every citizens of my country should no longer be aloof to danger.</div>
