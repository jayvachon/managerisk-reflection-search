    <div class="field-value">Key strength:Defining balanced use of all tools and taking thoughts to "home".
To make it better: The use of building connections cooperation between pods (citizens) was not mentioned, but I also hardly used them due to the tool not being user-friendly at all. But the takeaway is clearly mentioned in the reflection. Good job!
