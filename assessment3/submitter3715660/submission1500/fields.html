    <h1>Submission 1500 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3715660, session_user_id: 21a7c413247962a489d5c9f7cdb0cb08fb4aebca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong><em>The role
of risk management</em></strong> in the game I learnt how to plan and draw strategies that
can give you some resilience because with the resources (pods and the island) available you plan for
them equitably.</p><p><b><i>Knowledge</i></b>, here you are tasked to carry out research especially
on comets look at severity and the impact that it might have on the investments
on the ground in this case protecting, my pods <span>. Knowledge gathered from
different comets help in the process of planning as you strengthen the pods against
the chance of hit and also buy insurance to cover for the losses that might
occur. </span></p><p><span><strong><em>What was done  differently</em></strong>, </span>I played the game twice it
helped, for the first time I had little knowledge concerning coming up with
strategies to minimize on the impact of the comets this turned out to be a
lesson and managed to balance the game where by I had to put as many pods as I can
because they kept on increasing my income slightly raised the ground because
raising it so high it is expensive to maintain. Consequently I managed to
reduce on the on damages through repairs and this would increase my income.<br /></p><p><b><i>Developing
a new version of the game, </i></b>I would
suggest including participatory approach in the game, because in this game the
whole island’s survival highly relies on one man’s shoulders yet it depicts the
image it’s a community and their involvement is fundamental in the planning
process. Regardless of relying on the insurance coverage it would be equally
important to incorporate the international humanitarian intervention because in
case the risk is tougher than anticipated we really need their informed view
about risk management. </p><p><br /></p></div>
