    <div class="field-value">All the key words and phrases are in the reflection. While the description is not always clear and easily comprehensible, the writer seems to have understood the logic behind the game and passed the first few levels. While I agree that changing insurance premium might reflect real life more accurately, I think the control we had over the coverage of insurance (25-50-75%) in the original game, already reflects this aspect. </div>
