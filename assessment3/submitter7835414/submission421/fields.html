    <h1>Submission 421 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7835414, session_user_id: 6152b5bae82c0a1c3ef7971437b53ee8d4add89c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game is set on the fictional island of Alora, where the
main risk present is the risk of flood from a meteor impact. Various risk
controls are available; including the ability to purchase insurance, increasing
the elevation of the island improving is vulnerability and the ability to
conduct research on incoming meteors. Risk management plays a role by balancing
the development of the community while simultaneously managing the possibility
of a negative consequence from the hazard. The main trade-off in the game is a
trade-off between economic development and cost. Risk management costs
community funds, which could alternatively be used to further develop the
community. A decision is always made as to either purchase the risk control, or
to upgrade pods to enhance economic development. This decision directly affects
development, as the choice not to purchase a risk control will save money in
the short term, but may cost in the event of a meteor impact.</p>

<p>The first time playing the game was done by purchasing the
best insurance, using all plots of land to have pods and using all available
funds to upgrade pods, and researching upcoming meteors when doing nothing else.
Level 2 was reached during this play through. The decisions made in the next
game were to only purchase insurance if a high risk (using risk is a function
of probability and consequence) meteor was imminent. This saved funds in the
first few levels, but saved even more in the later levels as insurance premiums
rose. Research was always undertaken as it can be done without financial cost.
However, it does take time and not possible to raise the land while researching.
Land raising was only done when a high risk meteor was detected and the land
had not already been raised. Therefore, it was not done anywhere near as often
as research. Pods were upgraded as soon as funds were available. If I had the
opportunity to do it again, I would make some insurance money available, so if
a high risk meteor was detected, insurance could be purchased before impact.</p>

<p>In the development of a new game, a change that could be
made could be that insurance becomes more expensive if a high risk meteor is
approaching. This more accurately reflects real life situations, where
insurance is more expensive if the insured items (in this case, the pods) are in
a high risk environment. This better represents risk management choices in real
life, for example motor vehicle insurance premiums are dependent on aspects
such as age (where younger drivers pay more as they are inexperienced and have
a higher probability of crashing) and where you park your vehicle (premiums are
higher for those who park in the open as compared to in secure parking as the
severity of event is higher). Therefore, as the risk changes, the insurance
payment should reflect this. While there are many more factors, the probability
and consequences that make up risk is the underlying basis of risk management
in the real world, and the game makes an simplified reflection in a controlled
setting of risk management.</p></div>
