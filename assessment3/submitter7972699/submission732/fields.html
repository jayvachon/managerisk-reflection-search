    <h1>Submission 732 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7972699, session_user_id: 3dc572fd333be2b73f0f1e72f45f36e6e41cd8c0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the RiskHorizon game I managed to achieve lvl 5. At the beginning of my play I was unable to win lvl 3, because of the lack of research of comets (I didnt find that option before). That proves, that there is no possibility to win without the developement of every area of risk management.<br /><br />While playing the game I tried to analyse the possibility of the comet hit and focus on the development and protection. Only after seeing the comet with very high severity I decided to buy the insurance (almost in every game - but after building some pots = faster development).<br /><br />In my opinion there are several main reflections after playing the game:<br />1. It is very important to develop any field of protection in parallel to the development of business/society/infrastructure.<br />2. Sometimes there is no chance to avoid defeat or an accident, but the succesful risk management provided with the rules from pt 1. could help in rebuilding prosperity.<br />3. It is neccesary to analize the risks with exploration of the possibility of some accident.Â </div>
