    <div class="field-value">A good but VERY short attempt! No grammatical errors. Analysis and evaluation are present in the essay. The essay had to ideally have 400-600 words. Your approach to answering the 3 questions isn't correct. The following have not been answered:
1) What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?
2)What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?

Best of luck for the rest of your course!</div>
