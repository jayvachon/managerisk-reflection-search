    <h1>Submission 1553 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8311250, session_user_id: b76c2a3f65cfc8c490dd369b61647de65fa4ac52)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of this game is very important to me. It enabled me to clearly understand risk management processes. The game is set up and helped me know deeply what I should do to confront the shocks. I had to balance and use eficiently time and budget to build the pods, raise the village, research the comets. After the game, I noticed that I have to apply the knowledge and solutions from The interlinked components of risk management to address the shocks. According to such diagram I have applied "knowledge" to identify types of comets, chain of hits, severity and when it attact. Next I apply "protection method" to such as raising the village to reach safe levels of 4, 5 or 6, depending on the type of the comets which may impact on the earth. If I do not have time to upgrade the village's land to requied level, I will choose "insurance method" by buying insurance for the pods at the highest cost. Besides, I also regularly research the comets in order to reduce impacts if comets hits Earth as "coping method"</div><div>Besides that, when the incident occurred, I had to react quickly by notifing to the whole pods that help them to tacke negative risk and mitigate the bad effects to the village. Infact, applying above measures have helped me achieve a good result and reach level 5. </div><div>when I play this game for the first time, I distributed inappropriately money, lacked of  knowledge as well as information about the impacts of each comet, raised  unreasonably and inappropriately pods' land, bought insurance when not needed.  In the secon time I play the game, I rised  awareness about the impact of each comet,  height needed of pods' land to avoid impact when comets hit earth and regularly study comets to have a suitable strategy tackling shocks from Comets' hit. The main thing I learn from the game is the suitable way to confront the shocks by applying Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping. </div></div>
