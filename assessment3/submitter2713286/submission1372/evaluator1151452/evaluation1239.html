    <div class="field-value">This reflection shows the experience gained by the user throughout the game and he has presented in a very beautiful way. The user has tried to explore his choices in the game which is the strength in this reflection.

I would suggest writing this reflection in an essay format rather than writing in a question and answer format.</div>
