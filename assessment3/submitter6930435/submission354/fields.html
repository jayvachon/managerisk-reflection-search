    <h1>Submission 354 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6930435, session_user_id: cfeda0daf7a8d862b245cbf46bfed8903b494b6e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Playing the game was as enjoyable as learning from it. This game depicted the typical example of risk and managing it with three key resources i.e. Protection, Research and Insurance. In the game the key role of risk management was to teach the users the risk involved in developing any region of any nature. It taught the variety of obstacles which one face in the name of development such as any natural disaster or any man made activity triggering the birth of long term disaster. During the course of the game there were number of choices which had be made such as between the number of blocks to be constructed and along with it doing research work on the extent of damage of disaster as well as the probability of it to happen. Apart from this choice was also made regarding investing some of the monetary resources in getting insurance of the development to reduce the post disaster effects. At times trade offs were to be made between these three as all these three components were important in reducing the effect of disaster. Development was greatly affected when the knowledge about the risk was less as according to the knowledge gained the efforts or the means used to delay or overcome the risk changed. Most importantly the time period was increased and decreased as per the knowledge of the risk. Insurance on the other hand also helped in recovering early from the losses faced due to risk. <span>Playing the game
again after the first time made a difference from the first time. The first
time i was concentrating more on insurance and protection part. But as the levels
got higher and facing defeat made me realized that the research part was being
neglected due to which the probability of risk was unknown and there was no fun
of taking protection measures or getting an insurance of the development until
and unless one has complete knowledge of the risk, its severity, the extend of
damage it may cause, areas most vulnerable to damage, probability of its occurrence and the measures to be adopted to combat that risk. Inter dependence of all these factors greatly influence the vulnerability of development to risk and opportunity. As the number of developing units increased the in the region the safety measures also decreased and the probability of risk factors increased. Thus the game depicts that a sustainable development is one with balance between the protection measures, insurance measures and the research work regarding the probability of occurrence of the risk. Developing a new version of this game is bit interesting. All the key features of the game are efficient if some changes are to be added then that would be likely changing the research work. In spite of just gaining knowledge about the risk and its probability some other option could also have been added in the preparedness kit. Protection measures also includes appropriate planning of development. In spite of just placing the blocks on specified land. There can be way to substantially place the development blocks at a location where the damage by the risk would be least. As all the places do not have same level of risk vulnerability to risk. Variation in physiography of regions leads to variation in the risk susceptibility of the region. Thus the planning considerations should be incorporated in order to add another angle to this risk management. Risk management is also dependent on the level of knowledge gained through research and level of knowledge decides the measures to be taken in the coming time period to delay the danger or level of danger of the risk. </span><br /></div>
