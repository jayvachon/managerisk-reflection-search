    <h1>Submission 1689 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1574082, session_user_id: c804c4b11fc74dada580ac073ec6b9a75fa6d3dc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This game
shows exactly how the risk management is. In every moment, with any decision,
it is a risk that a comet can break all my work and I must invest more to grow
up again. I learn that there’s always a risk in our decision and always there
are money to loose or to win. But for win a game, you must assume any risk and
play without fear. And without fear doesn't mean loosing the minds, it means that I have to risk for winning and growing. </p>

<p>I play the
game twice. In the second game I choose to build once and to keep money for recover
the lost by hits. I tried to find a strategy, but I just choose to invest less,
hoping that the comet will not hit me. The game helps me to see the ways of risks in developing something. You can lose, you can be missed by a hit, but you always must be prepared.</p></div>
