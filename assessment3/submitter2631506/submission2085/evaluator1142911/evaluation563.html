    <div class="field-value">I agree with all except "the cost of risk management is not dangerous for your developing." what can be a subject of your next reflexion. If the risk management has to be effective, the assets have to be covered against risks. If you identify risks, and then say, that the assets will be not insured against risks due to the insurance price, for what reasons you then use risk management. If the risk management costs are in amount let say 5 percent of your assets /50000 USD from 1 000 000 USD sounds sure too much only for insurance/ and your risks will appear in extent of only one fourth of your assets value, without right insurance you will face 250 000 USD loss. Now we can compare the cost 50000 against 250000.Please read the world statistics, it is full of natural disasters with losses over the amount you can imagine. So risk management should not be dangerous for your development because his role is to support your decisions with aim to avoid expected risks.                                  </div>
