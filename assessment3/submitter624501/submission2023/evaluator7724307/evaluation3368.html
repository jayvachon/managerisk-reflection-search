    <div class="field-value">The writer clearly has a strong background in risk management and business skills. However, the writer completely failed to address the questions of this assignment. I felt like I was reading out of a textbook or reading my notes from lecture. The purpose of this assignment was to reflect on the game and how it allows players to relate to the complexities of risk management in real life. The writer briefly mentioned the game twice in the entire narrative and the two statements said absolutely nothing. Although the writing was informative, it failed to address the prompt. </div>
