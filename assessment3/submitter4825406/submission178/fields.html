    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.	I played the game several times, and the highest level I could attain was level 3.  The game was very challenging depending on what the given situation at the time.  Sometimes it was difficult to build structures, purchase the right amount of insurance, research the meteors, and raise the level of the planet.  Each time I played the game, I tried a different strategy.  I believe I played the game a dozen times.  Sometimes I built several structures and purchased the medium insurance, and did lots of research on the meteors, and still try to raise the planets land.  Other times I built a few structures, and tried to increase their strength by upgrading them, and at the same time researching the incoming meteors.  Most of the time I did not get to raise the level of the planet because I was too busy researching the meteors, and trying to improve the building structures.   I could not find the correct balance since I could not get beyond level 3.  The game is very challenging and to degree represents the balancing of risks.  My grandson who is 10 also tried the game and he could not get above level one.  He also found the game to be very challenging.
2.	Because each time the game changed it was hard to come up with a strategy that I believed would work.  When I had good insurance and did lots of research the structures did not cost lots of money to repair, but I found that the meteors came several at a time, with most causing some major damage.   The one risk I had trouble managing was the rising of the planet surface to assist with the protection of the planet.  I tried to build at least 4 structures and have a minimum of basic or medium insurance.  I also tried to do as much research as I could on the incoming meteors.  Sometimes it was more difficult because they came in several at a time.
3.	If I had the ability to change the game, I would make the cost of the structures and insurance a little more reasonable.  I would also give the game player the chance to create public buildings such as police and a fire station, and a hospital.  This would make the game more realistic in my opinion.  If a hospital were to be damaged it would hinder getting help to the citizens, and if a fire station was to get damaged it would hinder the rebuilding process.  Also I would create another type of natural disaster such as earthquakes.
I found the game to be fun and challenging. And also a very effective learning tool to deal with risks.  It is very hard to find just the right balance to deal with risk no matter how hard we try.
