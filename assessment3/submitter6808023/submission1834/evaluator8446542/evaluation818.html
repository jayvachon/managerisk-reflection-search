    <div class="field-value">The starting of the write describes exactly what was expected as the outcome of the game.
But clarity and comprehension was missing. Also it would have been better if the student would have tried the game multiple times as it would have improved his/her performance and would have helped in finding out as to what was going wrong.
Also the suggestion of " including an optional price list for selecting various level of raising the planet and the corresponding cost of the same" did not made sense as the level of raising the planet and the cost involved was already a part of the game. The more one raised the height, the more it cost!</div>
