    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is the last paragraph of the text. The last paragraph very well explains what kind of change the writer has proposed and why the uncertainty was his/her choice.

My opinion is that this text should be organized in better way, with better expression of thoughts and with more understandable paragraphs.
