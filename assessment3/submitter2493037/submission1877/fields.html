    <h1>Submission 1877 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2493037, session_user_id: 5ac2ba0d62328687a7aa99f0d9c8ac32fa304e6c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>The comet game is all about adequate preparation for
disaster in the face of challenges. The game allows one to look at various
risks associated with the disaster and how to manage it with the tool
available. For one to be able to manage risk effectively, one needs to do some
research to find out what could be responsible for such potential disaster. The
next step is to have some preventing measures against such risk, and insurance
could be handy to manage the situation should the unexpected happens</p>

<p>From my experience, playing the game could be very
challenging and tough, because it’s very difficult to move from one stage to
the next. One stand a chance to loss of the points and effort put in place
should the pod got damaged and therefore there is the need to start the process
all over again. However, the game is interesting because it allow one to
manipulate all the available choice in order to respond to such disaster. To
that effect, one needed to effectively respond in such a way by preventing any
catastrophe and by relying on all the tools available at ones disposal.</p>

<p>The comet game makes it possible to rely on community for
help in the time of adversity. However, there is the need to accumulate
research as that would enable one to have detailed understanding on what could
be responsible for of the potential disaster and how to manage it effectively. The
management approach would enable one to rely on the entire tools available for
crisis management. </p>

<p>The laminator powers available are; research, protection and
insurance. Each of these makes the game more challenging as one need to deploy
appropriate tool at the right time. To prevent disaster you have to manipulate
the laminator power available at your disposal. First of all, you have to do
enough research and after which you need have some protection against any
potential danger. The insurance policy enable one to have a sort of cushion and
the possibility of recovery should disaster happens. To that effect, all the laminator
power have crucial role to play in risk management</p>

<p>Another interesting thing about the game is how to prevent
the pod from being damaged and that could be a great challenge because if the
right choices are not made the pod could be damaged. The implication of that is
that all the efforts put in place to prevent the wave would end in futility. To
that effect, the possibility to progress to the next level is remote, and that
mean one is unable to achieve the desired result. However, by obtaining
insurance policy pod damage could be quicker and cheaper to rebuild.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to know what to do and the right
time to do it; and I think that is the essence of the game. The ability to make
the right choices is very essential in the face of challenges and risk
management. It’s only when this is done well that we could take advantage of
the potential opportunities  </p><p><br /></p></div>
