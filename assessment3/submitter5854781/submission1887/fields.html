    <h1>Submission 1887 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5854781, session_user_id: 494c4c436486e0e331207687918ffaf7c745f032)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The role of the risk manager was to ensure that there was a balance between the knowledge, protection and insurance aspects of risk preparedness.  The choices I had to make included: when to press the protection button only, when to purchase the insurance and when to purchase the insurance and press the protection button to prevent damage to the pods if the comet hit the island. In addition I had to make choices on when to build he pods and when o protect the already built pods from the falling comets. The trade offs included stopping to build the pods to either continuously hold the protection button or to purchase the insurance.  As for the way preparation affected development immediately was that either, the comet  missed to hit the pods or if it did, there was no damage and therefore, there was no time lost in terms of development  or resources wasted..<br />2) I played the game more than once and this is what  I did after the first time. I went back to the tutorial  and mastered it. It provided very good guidance. and when played the game second time I  made progress up to level four (4) of the game. The things that I learned are a) Knowledge is critical if one is to make the right decision. Decision on when to press the protection button only or press the protection button and purchase insurance at the same time was guided by the information provided on the comets. In addition the speed at which the comets were falling as well as the number approaching the island guided my decision whether to just press the protection button only or to press the protection button and purchase insurance to compliment each other.  2) Protection is important for risk management. By pressing the protection button, the comet would miss to hit the pods. 3) Insurance and protection compliments each other. When comet managed to hit the pod, there was no damage and was relieving to see no lost development as indicated by the development bar. 4) Action taken and on a timely bases makes the difference. I learned that that I had to take action and on timely bases to prevent the comet from hitting a pod or if it did, not to cause damage.<br />3)The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices  that matter in the place where I live  is to add  the aspect of coping </div>
