    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the description of the choices and trade offs the player had to make to pass the levels.  It was well articulated and shows that the player used the reading materials to guide decision making.  The reflection could have been better if the player played more than 2 times (it sounded like that) because certain things mentioned - comets not hitting due to raising the protection level and thus no incurred damages- were not the case.  Playing it a few more times would have exposed the fact that protection is more than just raising the ground (like connecting the dots reduced damages) and that insurance is a back up plan when enough money is saved from having upgraded infrastructure.  Also, a bit more about proposed change would have completed the reflection more.</div>
