    <h1>Submission 660 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 655752, session_user_id: 895d647f01d1bf90eca4ef93b85ee0e16aab06f8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.Risk management was one of the key factors of completing each level of the game. The risk in the game was getting hit by the comets and timely completion of the pods. The trick was managing development of the pods, protecting them from the comets while trying to develop them as the money allotted depended on how fast and how many pods were being developed. While playing the game I had to first choose to develop few pods while purchasing insurance to protect them. Since protecting the pods needed fund for insurance, I had to compromise on their faster development and also number of pods that I could develop. There was a trade off between protection/insurance and development in the number of pods.<br /><br />2. I guess the main things that I learnt from the game are; acting fast and 'in time' rather than 'on time'. I would first develop as many pods as I can, then get them insured and then invest in their development.<br /><br /><br />3. I would have allowance of more funds so that multiple purchases/ developments can be done at the same time.<br /><br /><strong>The factors of risk management has been well explained through this game </strong>. <br /><br /><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Acquiring Knowledge</strong>: It was important  first to acquire knowledge about how the pods were being  developed, what were the risks and what were the ways to protect the developments from the damages caused by the  comets.<br /><br /><strong>2.Obtaining Protection</strong>: Protection of the pods was very important,unless protected they were vulnerable to comet attacks , which led to delay in their development as the money and time was spent on their repair and yet with out protection they were endangered.<br /><br /><strong>3. Obtaining Insurance </strong>:Hence,getting the pods insured was a necessity as the damage is partially if not fully, covered by the insurance. The money paid by the insurance company to repair the pods in case of any damage is actually the money saved by the developers of the pod and that could be applied towards their  further development.<br /><br /><br /></div>
