    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The fictitious land of Alora is constantly plagued by calamities,somewhat mirroring the real life scenario that many countries are facing in today's world.Being no Titans,there is no way we can stop these drastic events from occurring.The game,however,teaches us the essentiality of acquiring information about the dangers we face,the walls we need to build to save ourselves and keeping fallback options.Not only can it save us from hitting rock-bottom,but also help us to get up and running again.<br /><br /><strong>Knowledge</strong>(Research) is an advantage to us as it reveals the relevance(chances of hit) and strength(severity) of the calamity facing us.It gives us an idea about the level of preparation and protection required.<br /><strong>Protection</strong>(Raising the island) is of utmost importance as it acts as a shock absorber,blunting the edge of the attack.<br /><strong>Insurance</strong> is necessary to bring back what we had built and lost due to unfortunate events.<br /><strong>Development</strong>(Building pods) is the way forward for a better society and should not be threatened or hindered by shocks.<br /><br />Initially,the strategy was to build more pods as they provided revenue and to provide protection(continuously raising the island),leaving out insurance and knowledge.However,the development bar is not affected by just earning,but also by developing.Hence,the battle was lost.Next approach was to keep insurance to the minimum,objective being maximization of wealth.Again,the damages were high and before everything was normal,another hazard struck,pushing me further back.Knowledge was still out of the picture.Third strategy was to boost development(building pods) and provide high insurance,keeping the protection minimum as it was cost-extensive and apparently provided not much benefit(an erroneous assumption).The strategy that made a difference was the one which was based on synergies between knowledge,protection,insurance and development.Knowledge conveyed whether raising the island was necessary or could it be covered by insurance,thus saving cash for other purposes.Protection was kept to a comfortable level(4 bars) so as to strike a balance between cash reserves available for development,repair and upgrade and minimum level of dependable protection.Too much protection left too little funds for development.Too less protection left me too vulnerable.Insurance helped in quick recovery as repairing costs were modest with insurance as compared to costs of repairing without insurance.Also the more the insurance(50% or 75%),the less cost-pressed was the issue of repairs against when the insurance was less(25%)<br /><br />Due to giant strides in science,we now know more than we used to a decade ago.The game provides a single means of protection i.e. raising the island.However,we have more options in real life scenario.The game could provide other means of protection,which,although costlier could act as sturdier buffers like building re-usable space vehicles which could change the direction of comets or deploy cheap relocatable decoys in the atmosphere that prevent entry or investing in cheap shock absorbing rubber embankments on coasts.<br />Also,Research information on a calamity should be constantly and readily available and not on-demand basis.Research is a continuous process and should not be left for D-Day.<br />Although,these shortcomings make the game more exciting,risk managers should not mimic this scenario in real world.<br /></div>
