    <h1>Submission 738 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2904405, session_user_id: 43ee244b8232c34b4a0ccff6511dfa9862e95711)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I found the riskhorizon game very enjoyable and useful. Addressing the questions, i emphasize the following:<br /><br />1. Risk management was the key to succeed. I reached level 6 following the above strategy: The first three levels, i focused on building and upgrading pods. The more i could the better. Research was the key point to succeed on avoiding damage, and of course to maintain the protection level according to the maximum meteor treat with severe chance to hit. From years 4 to 6, i focused on maintaining the protection level, to increase the research time, and i started buying a cheap insurance. On level 6, i bought the medium insurance plan, but never used it. I was never hit buy a meteor, thanks to research and protection level.<br /><br />2. If i played the game once, i would have bought from the beginning some insurance, losing valuable money from building/upgrading pods. I would also spent less time on research. Again i repeat that i think research and maintaining the correct protection level, were the key points. I conclude that almost everything we do has some cost, whether in time or resources. Appropriate risk management, which includes appropriate evaluation of the following danger, fast interaction with tthe world community, appropriate preparation are the key points to protect the community and develop. Definitely you must acquire some insurance, but you must evaluate appropriately, so not to expense excessively.<br /><br />3. If i was allowed to make one change, i would introduce the importance of institutions to the risk management, by adding a choise to construct and upgrade a "Risk Management Institution", which would reduce the damage made by meteors, but would be more expensive than building/upgrading pods.<br /></div>
