    <div class="field-value">This student demonstrates a good understanding of the principles of the course and that upfront investment in protection can have benefits later on. I like how s/he applies this knowledge to the global situation and that people should work together to develop better outcomes. 

The student did not address the first part of question 3 (what would you change in a new version of the game?), This may be implied in the final paragraph? I'm not sure. Stating the change would be useful for clarification and ensuring all questions are answered.</div>
