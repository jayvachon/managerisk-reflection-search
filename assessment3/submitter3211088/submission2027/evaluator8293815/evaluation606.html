    <div class="field-value">The article was written in 122 words which were all in bullet form thereby making it difficult to see what message was coming through. It would have been better presented if the author answered the questions as set out in the exercise. This would have resulted in more clarity and structure to the assignment.   

Whilst the comprehension was good in the form that it was provided, the potential to get a higher mark would have achieved if bullet points were converted into sentences and structured in a logical flow. 

On reflection there was evidence of what the author would do i.e. insure his house but the remainder was mainly a reflection of the game. The author could have converted and analysed the lessons from the game to make his understanding come through even better.
