    <h1>Submission 1348 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8268157, session_user_id: a613eeda0cdf9402e491547280336f3ba477bec4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is Building resilient communities. Resilient to mean physical structures and social relations have to be adapted to and protected from regularly occurring risk of disaster.

The management choices or decision is on resource allocation. Basically allocating money (capital) for development or protection (insurance and knowledge generation) although protection is integrated to development where structures are built to withstand shock.
I played the game a number of times. At first, I just did not understand the game but after some trying reached level 3 or 4 then back to level 1 where I stopped playing.

What I learned is that risk management is integrated to development. It is a key element in sustaining development. Another lesson is that development is risk taking and managing the risk.

The game could be farther improved with better and realistic graphics like the Sim City game. Another is having structures or development that generates revenues.
