    <div class="field-value">It is clear that the player did learn while playing the game and he/she was able to clearly described what happened. It is also interesting to suggest to make a game that is closer to reality. However, there is little apparent reflection on how the game reflects risk management in real world situations. It wuld have been more thought provoking to explain how the game is useful to learn risk management and how the basic principles are represented in the game.</div>
