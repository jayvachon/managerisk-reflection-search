    <h1>Submission 612 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7589027, session_user_id: e429853611c5f357fa887a94145dd8addd7c9d26)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.<br />Risk management in the game was about investing initially limited resources in development that could sustain comet hits and subsequent flooding from waves. The choices I faced were how much to spend on building communities (pods), on upgrading life quality, on insurance, and on structural mitigation versus how bad the impact of a comet may be. The trade-offs were: 1) spending resource on protection when a threat was detected and forecasted to be oncoming instead of spending resource on upgrade, and 2) spending resource on upgrade while there were no threats on the horizon.<br />2.<br />i played several games. I learned early that I mustn't let development of pods slide in favor of spending most resource on protection. I also learned that one should buy insurance with maximum coverage as soon as possible, as it was a cheaper than to wait when more upgrades were made.<br />3.<br />If an advanced version is possible, I would add public opinion as a layer of complexity, that one would not gain as much resources if people feel unhappy with their level of development, and also add public awareness programs as a form of protection to improve the public's understanding for why it is necessary to invest in protection.<br />4. <br />Although there is no question on the game itself, I would like to say that the game is very interesting for me, and I congratulate the development team.</div>
