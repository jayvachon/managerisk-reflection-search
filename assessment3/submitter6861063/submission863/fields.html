    <h1>Submission 863 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6861063, session_user_id: f6518beb4a3b83513a7bc6e56582c7fb8b06d7b7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I believe that in this game risk management has the role both of preventing the negatives effects of a shock, by building connections, elevating the terrain and upgrading the pods, and coping with the aftermath of the shock, by having insurance.</p><p>I played the game once, and reached level 4, having successfully completed 3 levels.</p><p>After building the first pods, my first concern was to buy the highest insurance, and I also did research for as long as possible so that I could have more time to build connections in order to minimize the risk. On the second level I upgraded the pods and did the research but I didn't buy the insurance and as a result when the sock it, it coasted more to repair the pods and my development level fell. On level 3, the last one that I completed successfully, I bought the insurance, again the highest and elevated the terrain as much as possible, I also did the research for as long as I could.</p><p>On level 4 that I didn't complete, if played again I would spend more time upgrading the pods, so that my development would rise faster and less time elevating the terrain.</p><p><br /></p><p>As to the last point on the assignment, the only thing that occurs to me now is making the elevation of the terrain faster, and not as detrimental to the development.</p></div>
