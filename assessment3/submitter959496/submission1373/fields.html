    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><pre>The role of risk management is to show that the risk should not be avoided, but studied. It is important to know the alternatives to adopt a strategy that allowed me to advance in levels. Maybe I should invest more in insurance,so that the reconstruction was cheaper. Preparation is key to knowing what to do when the comet is about to hit orreaches Alora: use the insurance, repair pods, raise the level of the city are some of the options we have.
</pre><pre>What I did differently the first time I played was to spend more time on research on comets, because the chance ofthe comet hitting Alora and severity decreased with it. The more information available, the better I can make my decision. It was necessary to balance time research with practical actions, such as improvements in pods and reconstruction when hit.</pre><pre>Involve the impact of decisions on other characters in the game, like the government, neighbors, for example. Riskmanagement is also influenced by others that are in the environment. That would leave the game certainly more difficult to reach the end successfully, making it more real.</pre></div>
