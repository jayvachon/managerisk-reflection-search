<p>Essay about my experience with Risk Management</p>

<p> </p>

<p>This essay has the objective of show my points of view and learning on
this activity of the MOOC Risk Management of Coursera. According to the course
design, I found particularly interesting my role as decision maker in the game.
I had some challenging minutes in the first rounds of the game trying to
understand how to make a proper trade-off within all the variables in my
control. I realized that to win I have to develop my community quickly since I
have a time constraint. Nevertheless; it was very important to keep an eye on
the possible factors that could derail such development. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I know that prevention towards risk is costly but in my opinion it
should be seen as a necessary investment. The preparation naturally takes
resources and time but the lack of it hinders the development for a longer
term. With such idea in mind I have always seen myself as someone willing to
prevent undesirable results. Therefore I started the game always purchasing
insurance to minimize threats. The study of the comets impact gave me a great
perspective on how to assess damage of potential risks with just easy
information. This could easily be translated to other contexts. As I moved
forward in the game I realized that risk management relevance can be easily
transmitted through this kind of instruments. And you can see with an easy tool
how grave could be to neglect potential threats.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As I played several rounds of the game trying to improve I started to
make a higher development to just one part of the island. Concentration gives
you focus and gives you strength in my opinion. The results turned the way I
liked it. One I developed in a deeper way some of the pods I moved to other
part of the island covering the territory in a more sequential fashion. I also
tried to concentrate a bit less on raising the island to save a bit more of
resources in order to escalate community development. Another important learning
I developed was the ability to respond quickly in crises connecting the pods to
minimize damage. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I would be in the role of adding something else to the game to make
the learning more evident I would certainly think in adapt new contexts for
students. I would check how to exemplify risks in a factory, in a services
company, perhaps within a home. The basic rules to understand risk seem
affordable enough to student to adapt them to other scenarios and make in that
way the learning process richer. Just as a closure of this activity I have to
say I deeply enjoyed it. </p>
