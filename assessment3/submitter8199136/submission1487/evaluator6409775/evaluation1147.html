    <div class="field-value">One of the key strength of this reflection: That the better one’s preventative protection is against the resulting impacts, the better position you are in to effectively (and at lower cost) utilize your resources to further sustainable development.
One thing that you could add to make this reflection better: Adding a response addressing the third question: “What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?”
