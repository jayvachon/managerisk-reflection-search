    <div class="field-value">(i) Key Strength of the Reflection, as I perceive: A careful Inter-play of components of (i) Protection, (ii) Research and (ii) Development, although it clearly portrays the approach to development through the phenonmenon of “Reflex Action” as an individual over viewing a larger scenario, which has adequately down sized the concern of “Risk Management”.

(ii) Suggestion to respresent the Reflection better: The reflection overall hasn't at all addressed the role-play of elements with reference to the externalities, while it has clearly narrated the sequence of the occurrence & management of disaster mitigation activites. However, in a real-time circumstance, research would be absolutely “Categorical” and “Dynamic”, with adequate “Qualitative and Quantitaive Assessments” as evidence to support the “Decision Support System” opearting within a composite mechanism involving a “Fulcrum” and “Pivot” as the coordinates.   Further the outline of the “Business Strategy” game which appears to be a mere sequence of recurring events, it is worth to analyse that the events dont not merely occur in an orderly manner, but also with varying “Intensity” & “Devastation” which is proportionate to the efforts of establishment in a negative manner, which is the key input to the assessment of efforts that needs to be input in a dynamic manner , without compromising on the upcoming development, through the elements of (i) Insurance & (ii) Knowledge Management & (iii) Protection.
Further, while the action that you've input has been illustrated more as a need based activity, rather than an effective response mechanism, along with the elements said above which as are not mere supporting factors but pillars of development leading to sustainability.</div>
