    <h1>Submission 2219 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4108074, session_user_id: 09c1f5d33c0fbf804e03b50efce74a276d1790a1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to protect the pods that produced income from the comets either by 1) purchasing insurance to help cover the cost of damages or 2) to defend the city by raising it above the sea. I reached level 5 after three failed attempts to pass level 3 once I realized that 1) I could not focus solely on creating and improving pods, 2) purchasing insurance was expensive, and if the buildings were damaged I would have to pay more, 3) that defending the city by increasing the height above sea level took time and money, and 4) it was very important to research comets prior to their arrival as it could improve the city's defense. Preparation for risk often involved taking away precious resources of time and money away from development. However, during these failed attempts I came to realize that a strategic combination of all four would be needed to pass level 3. 
In my successful venture I followed the following procedure. In the first level I developed five level one pods, which is how many you can make with the initial investment. In previous attempts I had developed as many level one pods as possible, but that did not allow for adequate risk preparation. I raised the city to level 3 protection in between researching comets. I took advantage of the end of the level after I had already reached my goal, because I had enough income and there were no more comets. In level 2, I improved the existing pods and developed the rest of the land with level one pods. I raised the city to level 5 protection. I usually tried to research comets up to level 6 to ensure I would have enough time to form enough connections. Otherwise I relied on the city's existing defense if the comet's damage was low. I continued this strategy of developing my pods, researching comets, and building my defense up to level 7 until level 4, during which I first purchased insurance, because the comets were becoming stronger and more frequent and I did not have ample time to build the city defense. In level 5, I purchased the maximum amount of insurance for $852 and after a level 8 comet damaged my city, I had to pay $161 per building for repairs. This burden of cost and lowered production created a major setback and I was unable to reach my goal. In addition, the time it took to improve pods to level 5 was much longer and after the attack, I did not have ample time and money to improve all the pods. 
If I were to play the game again, I would try to focus on improving city defense manually because it is the cheapest option and not to buy insurance because it is quite costly and after the city is damaged, it takes more time and money to recover which can be a fatal blow. I would also try to accumulate an excess income prior to level 5 in order to allow enough time for all my pods to be upgraded once more to reach my goal.
If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, a minor change I would make to better reflect the place in which I live would be to add the possibility to add more types of defense like missiles to intercept and explode the comets prior to impact. I feel like the US is a great military power and this is a typical defense for our country.</div>
