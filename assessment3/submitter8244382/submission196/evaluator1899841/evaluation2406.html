    <div class="field-value">In my opinion, your reflection on the game and how the different risk management tools are interconnected is really the strong part of your essay. Though there are some minor grammar and spelling mistakes in your short essay, you demonstrated very good analytical skills. All in all, this is a sound and good essay. I wish you would have written more. In addition, please consider wirting in paragraphs. Pasting the whole text as a single block makes reading less pleasent then it could have been. Anyway, keep up the good work. Cheers! </div>
