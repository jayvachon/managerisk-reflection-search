    <h1>Submission 196 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8244382, session_user_id: 35ea18464d7bbb3b880019a17994314281a2236b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is really interesting since it gives you the opportunity to take decisions within a possible risk of a natural disaster caused for a comet and it shows you clearly how to work to achieve risk management objective: build resilience and achieve prosperity . 

In the game the risk management is the key element to achieve development. During the game you learn how to prepare in face of a possible disaster and how to face the effects when the event occurs. What makes the experience unique is that in this process the game asks you to combine decisions in different but interconnected levels such as development, economic, knowledge, insurance and protection 

As lesson learned, for example, in terms of protection you prove that it is important to make an effort to know the probability of occurrence of the event and also to measure the possible consequences. By doing this research it is possible to undertake protection measures that will reduce the impacts in case of a disaster.

The insurance is also pointed out during the game and shows that the more developments you have the more you have to pay for the insurance. This fact demonstrate that even is the cost of insurance is high it is a necessary action in order to avoid disasters affect the path to development. 

The role of community is clear in the game because when a disaster occurs teamwork is key to reduce the impact in the society. 

Since I played the game only once what I would change if I play it again would be to be able to make more balanced decisions in terms of building new constructions and spending money in preparation. This because I think that may be I constructed new buildings too fast not always assuring its safety. 

Finally, I would only change a small thing about the game. My propose is to add a different kind of risk to the game so as you go truth the levels you have to take management decisions in a situation where you not only have to prepare and protect from a natural disaster because you also have to face with additional risk such as a financial crisis situation, or a technological disaster due to natural disaster such as in the case of Fukushima Disaster in Japan. 

I think this change  should be interesting since you can take more integral decisions in face of complex context that are more like the reality that we face in countries like Colombia.
