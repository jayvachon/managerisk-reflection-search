    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Management of Risks from unknown vagaries of nature :      <br /></strong>Through the game few roles for better risk management were tried to be taught.These can be summarized as follows:<br />The resources for mitigation of risks of any nature be it for any known or unknown are very limited and those resources are to be used in a timely and sequential manner to obtain better results.<br />Prior research based knowledge of possible intensity and likely impacts of any sudden shock from the vagaries of nature helps in timely precautionary measures in minimising the likely damages of life and properties as well as to take insurance covers to recoup the losses for sustainable well being.<br />The community working together helps collective power to enhance the collective protection and reduces the cost of recuperation.<br /><br />Trade offs were to be made between time allotted for acquiring knowledge and taking protection against impending shocks.<br />Trade off were also to be done by proving the heavy cost of insurance as against increasing the number of beneficiaries of development.<br /><br />The game was played more than once and a technical hitch for community connection was noted.Not very different lessons were learnt by playing again and again may be that few portions of the game were very fast while some others are very slow and these hitches needs to be rectified in next versions.Taking proper and maximum insurance cover appeared to be a prudent option. In low probability hits, ignoring the treat was a successful method by lifting the pods up from the water level.<br /><br /><strong><em>Migration from the risky places appears to be the only full proof solution other than the costly ways as has been taught in the class and through the game.<br /></em></strong><em><strong></strong></em><br /><strong></strong></div>
