    <div class="field-value">The student showed a lot of interest on the subject and tried several different actions to achieve the best possible results. That allowed him to explore the subject in a lot of different directions which allowed him to gain important knowledge in the exercise. Like him, I was very conservative in the start and learned to after a while risk more to get better results. I see that as one of the objectives of this course so that is a very positive outcome.
I think the student could have articulated his text a little better, trying to do a essay and not by simply answering the questions posed to him.</div>
