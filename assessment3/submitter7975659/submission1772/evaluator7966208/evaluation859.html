    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that it is a clear representation of the player's progression in the game, as the player has pointed out his/her failures and successes throughout the game. He/She took note of the mistakes he/she was making in the first few attempts of the game, and strove to avoid the negative aspects and take advantage of the resources available in a more efficient manner. 

One thing that I think would make this reflection better would be to emphasize more on the role of risk management in the game. While the game reflection covers the second and third questions very well, the first question has not been concentrated on as much as it should have been. Elaborating on the role of risk management in the game would give the reader a better idea of the purpose of the game and create a link between the role of risk management and its importance in real life, to be able to connect to the core of the subject that this course is based on.</div>
