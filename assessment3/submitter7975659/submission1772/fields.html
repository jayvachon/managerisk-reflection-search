    <div class="field-value"><p><b><u>Reflections of the Risk Horizon Game</u></b></p>

<p>The role of risk management in
the game was to develop a balanced community that was both protected from
things such as natural disasters but also at the same time to build the
community and take advantage of new opportunities. I had to learn how to
balance all the factors involved. Knowledge was very important, with that I was
able to research the comets and understand what their severity was, what the
likelihood of the comet actually hitting was and research allowed me to protect
my community. It was very important to have protection and insurance, without
protection the chances of the comet hitting were much higher and the damage
significant. By increasing my level of protection I was able to prevent a lot
of comets from hitting and in the cases where there was a hit insurance was
extremely important in order to repair the community in a timely and cost
effective manner. A fine balance of all elements had to be achieved in order to
properly develop and maintain the community.</p>

<p>I played the game multiple times
and as I was playing I got better at it because I learned the importance of
balancing, building the community, using upgrades and protecting and insuring
the community. The first few times I tried different scenarios such as not
purchasing insurance but using a high level of protection and doing more
research but this was not successful since when the damage did incur the cost
to repair the community was high and the time it took was very long hence I was
unable to meet my milestones within the time period allotted. Then when I tried
purchasing insurance and doing research but not using protection to raise my
community I learned that was also not successful because the severity of the
comets was very significant so there was always damage when a comet hit which
resulted in a lot of repairs. At the end I had to balance all three elements, I
made sure I bought insurance and used protection and always tried to raise the level
of my community to meet the severity in order to avoid or at least lower the
impact of the comet.Â  Research allowed me
to build community links that also helped protect the community.</p>

<p>If I could change or add one
thing to the game I would add another kind of risk. Right now the only risk was
the comet but in reality we face other risks besides natural disasters so I
would add another risk. An example would be to add workers and the possibility
of workers losing their jobs and as you play the game you would have to access
the likely hood of that occurring and then protect the worker against the risk
by having other alternatives to earn a living in place. Overall, I really
enjoyed the game it was a good way of learning risk management and how to
balance different factors to ensure that you are protected against things that
are not within your control.</p></div>
