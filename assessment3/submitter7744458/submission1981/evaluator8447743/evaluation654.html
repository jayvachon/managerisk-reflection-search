    <div class="field-value">I my opinion the main strength of this reflection is that it demonstrated learning throughout the game. For example the player learned that it is better to enforce at least some degree of protection before buying an insurance plan, as well as there is no need to buy insurance plans twice (better save up a bit and go for the one you originally wanted one straight away). Although the game was played only once, important conclusions were made on the completion of each level and alterations in strategy were made for future levels accordingly. This pretty much demonstrates how risk management works in real life, when people learn from previous experiences and hopefully avoid doing the same mistakes in future leading to more robust risk management systems. I also liked the game improvement idea a lot. I think that introducing specific means of protection, rather than just protection in general would make the game more realistic and challenging. It could be incorporated in a way similar to insurance. In the game’s insurance tab different policies offer different coverage and are therefore priced accordingly, same could be done for protection. Various means of protection (e.g. warning system, construction of waves barriers etc.) could be priced differently and increase the overall protection level to a different degree.

As for the negatives, I think that the reflection is a bit too descriptive and lacks in depth evaluation and analyses of risk management components and tradeoffs between those and development. It doesn’t have a clear explanation on how does the risk management preparation affect development and on what time scale do the costs and benefits arise. The explanation is not very clear and some bits are rather difficult to understand.
