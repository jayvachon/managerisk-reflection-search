    <h1>Submission 2376 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4317708, session_user_id: ca94eafddbd806616b2393bfdc693c6a1fd885bd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management in the game was very crucial. It involved </div><div>developing the village keeping in mind the available resources and also to develop smart mitigation </div><div>techniques. Those involved gaining the knowledge about the risk and finding ways to cope with them.</div><div>The insurance policy in case the disaster had occured was there in the game which covered the cost of </div><div>restoring the village. On and all the game was about the overall management of all the components of risk </div><div>management that are knowledge, protection and insurance and how to keep a good balance between them so</div><div>as to avoid any critical situation.</div><div>	The major choices that i made were proper development, a moderate insurance and also a thorough </div><div>knowledge ie research of the risk.It was very mportant to have a good research on the comets as a better </div><div>research gave more time for the community connections. Also better research sometimes reduced the potential</div><div>threat of the comets. Protection against the comets played a key role. The more you lift the land up the </div><div>better are your chances of less damage. Also making more pods and upgrading them helped to speed up all the</div><div>processes. Insurance covered the costs of restoration of damaged pods at a much lower price.</div><div>	The proper preparation helped a lot after the comet strike. It gave more time for community connections</div><div>and lower cost of restoration.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>I played the game more than once. The first time i played the game my pods were not upgraded and my research</div><div>time also lagged. Also i took the highest insurance policy which was not required in the lower stages of the</div><div>game. On playing for next time i took moderusiate insurance, lifted the ground to heights, developed the pods</div><div>and upgraded them and also did a good research on the comets.</div><div>	The most important thing that i learned was the importance of balancing all the processes for </div><div>properly coping with the disaster.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>The game was very interesting as well as very properly developed as it covers the aspect of risk management </div><div>in a very simplified manner. If i were to develop this game i would have added an aditional feature of </div><div>resource or tools otherthan money alone because even if you have enough money but still using the resource </div><div>efficiently is very important. This came to my mind because the place where i live is usually affected by </div><div>low rainfall, so managing the amount of available water efficiently is of prime importance.</div></div>
