    <h1>Submission 524 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7410969, session_user_id: 93e009c102ff7f08555cc37132b8bde7289765c4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of the risk management game was to help you better understand the relative values of each of the 4 risk management tools namely, knowledge, protection, insurance and coping.  Interestingly I thought that insurance would have more weighting than it did (perhaps that was because of my background in insurance) but after several poor attempts I soon learnt that this was not the case.  So early on I traded more insurance for less preparation and that did not work out for me.  Preparation clearly paid big dividends and this is true of real life situations.  So, early preparation proved to be valuable and research had a greater weighting than I thought, but on reflection, that also makes sense.  Good knowledge about the risk events that have the potential to make the biggest impact can only help in being better prepared.<br /><br />Maybe I am a slow learner but it did take me some time (about 5 attempts) to work out the relative merits and weightings for each of knowledge, protection and insurance.  Initially I was a little conservative in the way in which I utilized resources (particularly "pod building") but once I learnt the value of of protection I made much better progress.  The key learnings for me from the game were:<br /><br />1.   Effective risk management (in any situation) is best achieved by the right combinations of insurance, protection and knowledge.<br /><br />2.   Being prepared for any risk is just as important as having the resources to manage an event after it occurs.<br /><br />3.   If you have good protection then you probably need less insurance (good protection enables you take a larger excess or deductible).<br /><br />4.   Good knowledge of the risks that you face is also extremely valuable.  Fir example, historical data about weather patterns will greatly assist in determining what type of protection is best suited for differing conditions.<br /><br />The game, while simple in it's concept is a lot more difficult in it's execution.  Perhaps if the context of the game was to more realistically reflect a real life problem then that might make the game seem more like a risk management tool than a game.  I note some on the discussion forum were critical of the role of the game in this course, preferring to solve problems more analytically but I thought the game made you think without having the ability to refer to notes and maybe this is more of a test than simple multiple choice questions.  So, if I was to make an improvement to the game I would adapt it to reflect real life risk management situations such as major weather events (cyclone, flood etc), earthquake, pandemic etc.  The risk management strategies in each case remain the same (the right balance of knowledge, protection and insurance) so I presume that the underlying components of the game need little change, just the visual presentation.  If this was done then I would put more weighting on "passing" the game test than multiple choice questions for the reasons outlined above.<br /><br /><br /></div>
