    <h1>Submission 1885 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2755410, session_user_id: 70b970cb7158a86882815e676fd23359923a534a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game I learnt that it is very important to prepare for a risk but you can never be certain of whether or not a risk will strike. At times you really feel it inside yourself that a risk is definitely going to strike, only to be surprised when it does not strike. When you really feel confident that the risk will not strike, it does. At times it will be too late then to prepare for it. But with some insurance, the burden of having to shoulder the full impact if the risk is reduced. I also learnt that resources are also limited, one can not do what one might have wanted to do. The important thing is to make do with whats available in order to reduce exposure. Should a comet strike a coping strategy will be made easy by having insurance in place. Little protection is better than no protection at all. I also find it very important to invest in research so that the knowledge levels available can help mitigate the exposure to risks.
Should I have played more games I would have invested more in research and insurance and not try to work outside my budget limit. At times it is better trying to do just the minimum than trying to do everything.	
Improvement I would have on the game is to have available information about the likehood of a strike. Use of probabilities may inform planning better than working with no information at all about how likely the shock is.
