    <h1>Submission 460 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7972559, session_user_id: 5205cc085cfe16acaa150f34344d59fa091538d9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In playing the game, I took a couple of attempts to
understand the interconnecting conditions to pass the first level. I would
surmise that understanding risk management for this type of environment is
important and with that comes trial and error to create the right conditions. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>There were times when I was learning that I didn’t react in
time nor did I find the most optimum set of solutions. When I was able to sort
it out, the next level changed the dynamic again and I couldn’t use the same
processes. I really felt like I was blindly taking steps that I thought would
help and couldn’t predict the outcome. Trial and error could help, however it
does take a significant amount of time, the conditions need to be similar for
it to work the next time and I consumed resources that I many not need to if I
was better at the game. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I was allowed to change one simple thing it would be to
have a game/job aid providing examples of what worked well in the past. These
can be in the form of research, other planets in similar situations or outcomes
that have occurred that I should take into account.  There may not be easy solutions to play all
levels of the game, however collective experience/knowledge to gain the best
outcomes in this game would have been appreciated. </p></div>
