    <h1>Submission 1310 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7932862, session_user_id: 81ea792dd9a6acc040f0482236706a29f63cd9e9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management plays a main role in the game. Thanks to it, the village is able to prevent or reduce the negative effects of risk and to develop with a very fast pace. In the game, there are three fundamental parts of Risk management: Knowledge ( research ), protection (raising the ground) and insurance. The game shows how importnat is to find the right balance between these three elements because a perfect knowledge needs time and it is also necessery to build protection, so is importnt to make a decision about how to spend time. Another trade off is about money because both insurance and protection are expensive and resource are limited. moreover they also have an impact on the development of the village: money are actually necessary also for development. as we learned in a past video, this is a obstacle for risk management because in the short term there are only costs that are visible (less resources for development) and it is posible to see benefits only after some time. Although the protection and the insurance have a central role in the village's growht. Furthermore information allow to understand the level of risk and what risk management tools are better to use. It is a necessary and essential part of risk management. An higher level of research allow to have more time to find connection between houses and, in this way, to raise the overall level of protection.Â <br />I played two times and I completely changed the strategy used in the two games. The first time i played, I undervalued the role of research. So in the second game i invested more time in research, in particular for asteroids with a very high level of impact. I also reduced the expense in insurance and invested money in protection. I prefereed to use insurance ( both the medium and highest ones) only with very risky asteroids. I tried to stabilize the protection to a medium level in order to be ready to face every kind of risk. I think it is and essential decision because there is not development if there is not a right protection against risks even with the best insurance.<br />Thanks to this game, I learned hoe the different tools of risk management work and how they can be combine to accelerate the pace of development. in addition, the first thingh at the base of risk management is the information: people must know what type of risks are present in their country and what effect they have on their lives. Information allow to find the better solution for managing these risks and reduce the negative impact that they have. I also learned that risk management has a cost in the short term but, in the long term, its benefits are often higher than the cost ( it depends on the ability to use risk management of the decision-makers).<br />In a new version of the game, I would like to have a positive effect against asteroids also thanks the upgrades of the houses. In this version, i think that upgrading houses you have only a positive result in the level of development and in the money per minute but houses are not more stronger. In my opinion, it is a very ssimple improvement but it makes the game more realistic.</div>
