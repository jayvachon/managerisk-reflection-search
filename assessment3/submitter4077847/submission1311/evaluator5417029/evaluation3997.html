    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is that the writer thought much about what they learnt from  the game is this evidenced by the suggestion son how the writer could have played the game differently. The essay was not very clear about what the writer learnt from the game otherwise it was good and also has very good suggestions on how to improve the game. </div>
