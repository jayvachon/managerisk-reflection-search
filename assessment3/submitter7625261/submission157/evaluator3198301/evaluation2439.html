    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is it's ability to set the reflection to real life situations. The references to your home country and the difficulties it has encountered and is overcoming was inspiring. Your reflection also considered the topics that have been brought up in this course so far.

One thing that was a bit short was "If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game". But considering the rest of the text was so good, and there was a maximum number of words allowed, I see no problem with this</div>
