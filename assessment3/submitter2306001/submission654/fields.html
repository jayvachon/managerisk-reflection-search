    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management was capital in playing Risk Horizon. I doubt I would have cleared even the first level without it. I struck a good balance using minimal insurance and research, but a lot protection. I found that protection was the most cost-effective way to protect the village since it carried over from level to level, unlike insurance. Minimal insurance provided a good coverage for the cost, compared to no coverage, but higher insurance was costly. I could rarely afford the highest insurance package at the start of the level and by the end of the level, there were few meteorites left and it would not have been worth it. As for research, in many cases the first estimate was usually close enough for me to prepare the adequate protection. There was definitely a case of diminishing returns for research and since it took the entire screen, it prevented me from doing other actions like building or upgrading. Also, research had no impact on say the probability of a hit. Whether or not you knew the meteorite was going to hit, it could still hit or miss. Being prepared was a better solution and less costly than coping by repairing the buildings, even with insurance.
 
At first, while playing Risk Horizon, I found myself using a lot of risk-mitigating tools that sometimes hindered development. It took a while for me to strike a balance, but after playing the game multiple times, I was able to reach level 5 with a good balance. I learned that you must pay attention as much to global development than to punctual events like a disaster.
 
I would add the notion of opportunity to the game, perhaps in the form of technological improvement. This could be another form of research and knowledge. The more is invested in this type of research, the lower the intensity and lower the probability of a hit. In addition, this type of research could itself be a driver of development since it fosters employment, unlike insurance. Concretely, this could be making buildings more resistant.</div>
