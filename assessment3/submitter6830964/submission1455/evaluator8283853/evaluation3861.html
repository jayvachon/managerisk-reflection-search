    <div class="field-value">(I) Key Strength of the Reflection, as I perceive: While it is acknowledged that the game evaluation you've made several times has assisted in risk analysis and further in management to succeed in building pods, imbibing on the “Knowledge” factor more than the coping or protection mechanisms, is quite a think-tank approach to strategising an implementation plan.

(II) Suggestions to respresent the reflection better: The challenge of the game is to primarily establish the  quantum of risk vis-avis the financial implications that it shall incur for protection and coping, which has been neglected to a large extent, which is the foundation to the strategy to be imbibed upon.
While the trade-offs depend fundamentally on the assumptions made, the reflection statement implies that it is based  on a sterotyped mode of addressing an emergency circumstance. Therefore, to have it more accurate and specific, a string of multiple indicators on the outputs that shall contribute to the supplementary activities of protection and coping, to be strengthened as one builds on the pods to each level.
However, the ultimate mechanism that would have guided this in an apt manner would be the one of CPM assessment for Risk Management, which would be the factorial of all elements in consideration within the “Business Strategy” game. 
Further, civilian mechanims suggestions, are more a sort of reflief mechanisms rather than an evadence sort of factor.</div>
