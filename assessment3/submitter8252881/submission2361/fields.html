    <h1>Submission 2361 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8252881, session_user_id: 7c7557c4e64eb458556ce30df54544783ff37e07)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management was crucial in mitigating for the effects of the meteors on the development of Alora. The choices that I made were important in advancing to the next level. This often involved tradeoffs between the risk management activities; for instance I had to chose between building and upgrading and protecting. Research helped in knowing the possible damage capacity of a meteor and buying appropriate insurance, or increasing protection. often times, focusing on protection mainly, ended up in failure. when i developped a balanced risk management, it helped in development of the building.<br />The first time, i focused on protection (raising the bar) and it ended in failure. The second time I concertrated in building and it also ended in failure. it was thru balancing insurance and building as well as research that i was able to move to the second stage.<br />It appears, the components do not have the same impact on mitigation; building and insurance have the highest impact followed by research, and coping (repairing).<br /><br />The highest risk in my area stems from natural elements; seasonal flooding leads to destruction of property, livelihoods and lives. Early warning mechanisms (Research &amp; Knowledge) on the timing and amplitude of the floods (would be the most important in saving lives) but insurance would cover for crop and property losses. Community resilience would be an important aspect that I would introduce.  Protection measures such as constructing dams to slow seasonal water surges, or planting rice in the valleys repesents an opportunity to improve people's livelihoods while mitigating for floods.<br /><br />I would love to see more involvement of the state, to offer other livelihood opportunities not based on farming. </div>
