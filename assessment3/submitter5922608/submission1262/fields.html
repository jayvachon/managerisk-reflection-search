    <h1>Submission 1262 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5922608, session_user_id: 0a8b560c7284fe86c31abb7559eb1d79d413874e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Horizon is game that teaches a valuable lesson. The player gets to manage the resources of an alien civilization in a distant planet with the objective to grow and develop in certain time, while overcoming the hazards the natural hazards of this planet.<br /><br />The particular strategy i picked on the very first level was one where most of my resources frist went to protection for the pods, it would be useless to develop more of them if they would inmediately get destroyed by an incoming asteriod! I supose this is the case with less developed countries too, because the economic development can only be accomplished when you give your citizens some guarantees. That was the first lesson i learned while played the game. <br /><br />I choose to not buy insurance at first but as i progressed the levels it became clear that i needed to invest in insurance to protect the pods i had built upon that moment, without neglecting the investment in protection. It was arround level 3 that the game let me know that i wasnt developing fast enough to pass, and i realized was in the sitiuation described in some of the lectures: I was afraid of taking risks and i didnt see the oportunities because of this. Another risk management lesson right there. <br /><br />The third main lesson came when in higher levels where the hazards that the pods faced became more menacing, I started to rely less on protection and insurance(i never got the highest return plan) and depend more on research. That minigame that represents comunity links really gets to the point of teaching us how valuable they are, at this point i was  spending most of my resources on developing the pods.<br /><br />I lost at level 6. I lost because some particular damaging asteriod with low chance of impact hit my pods and i couldnt recover fast enough. If i had to do it again i would probably spend more time researching big treats, no matter how unlikely they may seem to happen.<br /><br />Its been said the game captures at some very basic level the main aspects of risk management. I guess if i really had to make a change to the game it would be to vary the fees for insurance depending on the asteroids in the sky as you could neglect insurance until impact was inminent and get it for the same price or at least it seemed that way.</div>
