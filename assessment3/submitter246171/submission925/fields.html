    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It is obvious
that the game was designed to train risk management skills and it had it almost
all – probability and impact of the risk, research (gaining knowledge),
insurance and protection and limited resources. I would confess that it was
quite difficult for me to manage all the possibilities and to find the right balance.
I actually did not succeed in finding it. I managed the levels from 1 to 3 but
passing level 4 was impossible for me. The reason was that the severest impact
were just at the end of the game were despite the knowledge, the protection and
the insurance the impacts were so big that I actually did not have the time to
rebuild what was lost. It tried to build different strategies by managing the
level of the different components – knowledge, protection and insurance, it
tried different building strategies but all was in vain. The huge impacts at
the end of the 4 level destroyed all my efforts. I played the game several times
even on different computers. What I noticed was that on some computers the
level of protection was increasing with different speed. On one of the commuters
I was not able to raise the land enough to light the firs bar on the right. </p>

<p>I few words
should e said on the game itself. It covers the basic understanding of risk
management and it gives some tools to train risk management. What I couldn’t find
was the opportunities given by the emerging risks. I also could not understand
the way the money in the account was increased. Was it a rent from the units build?
Was it random? Because money and time have very restrictive influence on the risk
management strategy. So restrictive that it was impossible for me to find the
winning strategy. </p>

<p><span>If I had to
design the game I would definitely try to make it a little bit easy to find the
winning strategy for each level. As the game is designed at the moment the
learning is quite difficult and there for the knowledge gained by the player is
very limited. I would definitely create a feedback loop to help the player see
the pros and cons of each strategy and to help him compare the different
approaches. Other wise most of the players will be suck only to basic knowledge
and skills in risk management.</span></p></div>
