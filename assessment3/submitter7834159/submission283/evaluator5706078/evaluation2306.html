    <div class="field-value">The student has obviously reflected on the game and demonstrates how each of the risk management tools affects the development of the pods. However, there was not a clear understanding of the cost return benefits of protection versus insurance. There was also no explanation regarding the role of communication in risk management, represented by having greater knowledge when the comets hit. Overall it was a good analysis, however, it could have been better if the student had used a real example at the end to clarify the issues that they faced with the game.
Well done </div>
