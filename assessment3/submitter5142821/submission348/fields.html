    <h1>Submission 348 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5142821, session_user_id: 00e8fa9d38fc0739f9f4e9e1e0fec4f737494e25)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Â </p><p>The role of risk management in
the game was clearly to build resilience by mitigating the severity of negative
shocks and to enhance the ability to cope with the after effects of adverse
shock, fostering quick recovery. It also played the role of achieving
prosperity by improving development through undertaking risk coated
opportunities for prosperity/development. All of these involved getting
insurance and the necessary quantum of it, engaging in research with respect to
the expected or envisaged shock as well as elevating the area mapped out for
development as a protective strategy.</p><p>Different choices and trade-offs
were necessary in the process of playing the game. For instance you had to
sometimes make a choice between what insurance to purchase at what time, when
to elevate (protect) at the risk of loosing the game as the side bar turns brown and then
red upon attempting to elevate; choices also of the pursuit of research with
regards to the approaching comets, which research also had the effect of
reducing or sometimes eliminating the severity of the damage; there was also
the choice of applying available funds to developing the pods, creating new
ones, repairs and further insurance. Sometimes the development process was
sacrificed for research and continued research to mitigate the severity of
impact, at some other times repairs were expedient and inevitable just as
continuing the development of the community was and at other times it became necessary
to hold up the key to elevate the platform in order to reduce the impact of the
shocks. In essence, insurance was always necessary while the whole development
project was underway and as it became expedient from level to level the
insurance cover had to be increased. Knowledge was key and protection
necessary. But knowledge ahead of protection reduced the severity of the risk
faced while it also allowed for time to increase funds necessary for both development
(including repairs) and buying insurance cover.</p><p>Preparation for risk either
completely eliminated the risk or greatly mitigated its impact. However,
preparation for risk limited the time available for development but gave the
opportunity to accumulate the funds needed for further development.</p><p>Playing the game more than once, I
learnt to take my insurance early enough otherwise the insurers were at some
point of imminent danger not ready to insure even though you had the fund for
the insurance cover. Also learnt the increasing the spate of development was necessary
as it increased also the availability of funds just like research and that
early insurance resulted in low cost repairs. Research was expedient always and
as aforesaid reduced the severity of the shock and under certain circumstances
eliminated it; protection created some risk of losing the game if one was not
careful but if you got the timing right it was good. I observed also that the cost
of repairing severe damages was on the high side and without insurance it was
exceptionally high. The cost of development was as well high especially when
you had to improve on the pods.</p><p>









</p><p>On question number 3, the need to
include the ability to engage in several risks management options at the same
time perhaps with delegation strategies.</p></div>
