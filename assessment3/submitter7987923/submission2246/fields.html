    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">What lessons have I learned from this game ?
After plaing the Risk Horizon game, I learned some lessons, and I wish to make the following reflections about managing risk.
First Lesson : Whether risk is imposed or taken on voluntarily, the impact of shocks can be amplified or reduced depending on people’s external environment, their internal conditions, and their risk management. Some people may be vulnerable—that is, especially susceptible to losses from negative shocks—as a result of their exposure, internal conditions, and risk management.

 Second Lesson : Risk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the ability to cope once a risk has materialized. Preparation (or ex ante risk management) includes a combination of three actions that can be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge, obtaining protection, and obtaining insurance.This is what is known as the interlinked components of risk management.

Third Lesson: Protection and insurance can provide complementary means of managing risk
Protection can decrease the likelihood of very severe losses, thereby increasing the probabi-lity of routine losses relative to extraordinary losses. 

Fourth lesson :
Risk management is cost-effective—yet not always feasible Not only can risk management save lives, avert damages, and unleash opportunities, but preparation for risk often has high returns. 
 
If I were to play this game a second time, I will first focus on three main things. First knowledge of the type of risk ; then preparation in order to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits ; and finally I will insist on insurance so as to face  potential outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty.
What change would I propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live? I will design a game that reflect the reality of my own context, that is focussing on risks that people may encounter in my own environment.
