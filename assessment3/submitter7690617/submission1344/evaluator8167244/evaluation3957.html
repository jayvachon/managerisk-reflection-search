    <div class="field-value">This reflection was very interesting as it constantly reflects at each stage of the reflection. There was a good understanding of all working aspects of the game as well.
I believe that it is essential to maintain your 'additions' to the game within the current framework of the game. That is, it is a cartoon and yes it is not real, but the art of reflection is to transcend your world, your beliefs, your biases and move to understanding of that, which is presented to you.</div>
