    <h1>Submission 1051 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4059291, session_user_id: e13b7e1f9b0361b84507827556b24d1a9d766b26)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Role of Risk Management in the Game:</p>

<p>The game inculcates the principles of Knowledge Protection
and Insurance as a part of Preparing for Risks. It also takes into account the uncertainty
(eg: Impact/chance of hitting).Balancing Development and Risk management is
crucial and is emphasized by the scoring system of the game.</p>

<p>Learning from the Game:</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Based on Chance of hitting –adjust protection or
choose insurance policy</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Based on Insurance Policy-decide need for
frequency of Knowledge</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Match Severity with level of protection to
ensure safety</p>

<p>Suggestions for Improvement:</p>

<p>The game can depict the change in insurance policies offered
with reference to the risks (uncertainty/impact).It would also help if the game
tried to emphasize the factors that went into the development versus risk
conundrum like for example..How people would value development in an area where
you are prone to risks.</p></div>
