    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game I learned a lot.First of all is you must know the art of balance,and you should be very clear about the numbers of incomes and potential losts.Each decision you made was based on the data of the resourses that you got and data of potential dangers,you must learn to make iquick decision and observe the outcome of the decision,then you should conclude and analysy the decion,try to do it better in the next tern.I am very sorry I was too busy to spend too much time on the game,but I Iwill try it when I am free and write an essay about what I have learend from the game.In fact,you need a specific research about the game before playiing it and  plans in  different conditions and b e good at stastics.Never be blind with your former experience,dynamic imformation leads in dynamic competent strategy.I almost do not play games at all,but I am facinated by the simple and frustrating game(I only get level 2 after 2 hours trying).In my personal experience,the tough tasks always tautht me a lot.It is obviously that game is a big challenge to me.And I am not agree with the opinion that the game is a waste of time.In fact,it is a good model to help us understand our thought and behavior when facing risks.Thank you for the developers of the game,for me,It is the essence of the course.<br /></div>
