    <div class="field-value">The student provides outside information in his reflection, which shows that he understands the game's objectives. Making comparisons allows for a better understanding offen how the game is relatable to real issues in the world.

However, I don't think he clearly understood the role of research. Research was not free, nor was it specific to only one comet.If you had enough research it could cover the severity of several comets.

All in all, good reflection. The student did a nice job of recognizing his weakenesses and then learning from them.</div>
