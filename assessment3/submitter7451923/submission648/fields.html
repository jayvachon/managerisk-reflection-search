    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>                                                                                                                     Game Reflection Exercise</b></p>

<p><span>            Throughout
the game, risk management needed to be planned well and executed due to the
difficulty of later levels, and to some extent the earliest levels.  In my successful attempts at playing the
game, I focused on using early resources towards two plots of land and
upgrading them as soon as possible while also maintaining the protection bar
4-5 bars up in order to avoid damage. 
Elevating protection any higher was too costly and slowed down the
progress bar in reaching the next level, which led to multiple failed played
attempts.  The multiplying factor in
connecting the community was essential for the protection bar to be effective
when comets struck; therefore I needed ample time for the connecting mini-game
and required high research of dangerous comets.</span></p>

<p><span>            The
first few played games resulted in early failures around level 2-3.  This was due to filling all the land plots
with low level villages and keeping the protection bar high, within three bars
from the highest protection level.  I
also spent money on insurance in all of the early levels, yet this was never
utilized due to high protection levels resulting in no damage.  This resulted in resources being
inefficiently used and leading to failure after two or three rounds.  I learned that saving resources for insurance
in later rounds was necessary towards successful completion of the six rounds
but was detrimental in the earlier rounds when there was little risk that the
insurance would be used to cover damage costs. 
After finding the right mix between when insurance was needed and how much
progress and money should go towards protection levels and time researching
comets, I found advancing levels much easier and less frustrating than the
first few game attempts.</span></p>

<span>            In a revised version of this game, I
would add a village readiness mini-game that is different than the protection
level.  The protection level can relate
to how a public institution or the local government aims to keep their
community protected; however I believe the readiness of citizens to be prepared
when needed and/or have the awareness and knowledge on how to act when a
disaster occurs can have a huge impact on lessening the overall damage done
after a disaster hits.  This is why the
use of emergency drills in communities under constant danger, either due to
natural disasters or outside actors, is so prevalent around the world when
history has shown that communities are most vulnerable when they are not
prepared for unforeseen events. 
Emphasizing village readiness in a mini-game would highlight one of the
major insurances that cities employ around the world to best avert damages in
the aftermath of a disaster.  Though
there are some costs to increasing readiness through public tutoring or
informing citizens, as well as staging large-scale emergency drills; the costs
are still likely to be less than large insurance plans to cover future
potential damages.</span></div>
