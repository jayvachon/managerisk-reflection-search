    <h1>Submission 417 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4183208, session_user_id: 042e405d23c1c28d2ccb97ba09fb81898f6c55c1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is that there is a trade off between different ways to prepare or protect against risks. Knowledge is a powerful source, but without protection, it is not worth a lot. Same the other way around, you can protect all you want but without proper knowledge, it is not worth as much if you would combine them. Insurance appeared to be the one with the least impact. Interesting that you cannot build protection while gaining knowledge, which is possible in the real world. <br /><br />During the game (I played it several times) I changed my strategy. The first time I started to invest lots of money only in protection. Even to a level of protection which was insane. I wanted the highest level of protection. But then I found out that without knowledge, the city is still damaged a lot. So then I knew I needed to change my strategy. The second time I first invested in a fair amount of protection, as a quick fix and immediate relief, and then focus more on the knowledge part, the long term solution. During the time I followed a comet, I made sure the houses were upgraded if there was money available. Then it is a challenge to keep those balanced: sometimes focus on the knowledge, sometimes on protection and sometimes on building more resilient houses. This helped me to complete level 4. However, I did not reach level 5 with this strategy, so maybe there is a better way. Anyway, the game shows perfectly you need to combine the different risk management factors.<br /><br />For me the most important thing missing is the incentive-factor. I think it plays a big role in if and where to spend money on/invest money in. The government certainly doesn't always care that much, because it does not affect them personally. Especially in countries where there is a huge gap between the poor and rich, the ones that live with great risks and the ones that make the decisions for everyone else. This point will however be impossible to integrate into the game without making it too complex.<br />Personally I found it weird that knowledge does not cost any money in the game (right?). Were I live, research costs lots of money. This is one of the reasons why not everyone wants to invest in knowledge. You need to invest the money in something you don't know exactly how big the benefit will be. Protection is more hands on, quick fix, but will not suffice in the end. So one thing I would change is that research also costs money. Then you have a real challenge: focus on the long term while a city is potentially in danger, or focus on the short term and trying to minimize damage for the rest of time. <br /></div>
