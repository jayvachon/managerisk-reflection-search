    <div class="field-value">I think the piece was well thought out. It fulfilled the assignment requirements, yet It was a bit pessimistic and did not allow for a view of the opportunities that could arise from the recovery of “the comet hits, and the rebuilding ” . Personally I believe when there is a disaster ( “ as a comet hit”) and there is rebuilding there should something good to express to show the resilience. The power of hope should be mentioned. "There is always something good that comes out of the bad events".
