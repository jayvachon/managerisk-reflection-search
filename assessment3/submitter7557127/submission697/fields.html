    <h1>Submission 697 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7557127, session_user_id: c115443f2585fe184685d83406884914517167ba)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>I have only written approximately 400 words as that is what the original description of this assignment stated rather than 600 as appears on this page.</strong></p><p>I enjoyed playing the game but certainly found it
frustrating at times! It took a few rounds to figure out some strategies that
would work the best. I still didn’t find the best strategies, however, as I
couldn’t get past level 3 in the 30 minutes or so I spent playing it.</p>

<p>Initially, I tried doing as much of everything that I could.
As soon as I had money I would build or buy insurance, etc. However, after a
few rounds I found that often the best strategy was to wait for a little while.
Also, instead of trying to build as furiously or raise the island as much as
possible, sometimes watching the comet for as long as possible was the best
course of action as it maximised the time for creating community connections
and that was important when there wasn’t enough time to try and protect before
the comet hit.</p>

<p>If I were to play again, I would focus on determining
exactly what worked when so that I could do better in the next round by
employing what I learned. I found that initially, I didn’t really pay attention
to exactly what I did and I think this would make a great difference in the
future.</p>

<p>One option that may need to be employed for this game (and
something that some island nations are needing to discuss) would be the option
of leaving entirely. Given the shocks in this game are entirely
non-preventable, there may be a need to relocate in order to ensure the viable
economic future of the people or else they will all spend their entire lives
just dealing with shocks. Although fictional, this game exemplifies the fact
that the area is unable to pursue opportunities because they are always dealing
with the effects of shocks. Due to the effects of climate change, some small
island nations are facing this very dilemma – do we secure our future by
leaving our home or put all of our resources on trying to protect the home even
though we have no control over the shocks.</p>

<p>Overall, I enjoyed the game and think it is a great concept.
It would be nice to have opportunity woven into it to really demonstrate the
essence of this course, but perhaps that will come at another time!</p><span>
