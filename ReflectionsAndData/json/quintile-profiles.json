            "reflection": "Refleciton on Risk Horizon gameRisk management is to\nprotect the community (i.e. pods) from damages by the comets, thus helping the\ncommunity to grow sustainably.   The game offers three choices for risk management, including Protection, Insurance, and Knowledge (i.e. Research).  Protection and Insurance are money-costly and I normally need to trade-off one for the other.  Knowledge is time costly.   To successfully manage the risk of comets hit which causes waves, I used the following priority order: Protection, Knowledge and Insurance.   Using the above three choices may\naffect development in both way (i.e. immediately or after some time).  For example, protection and insurance are costly, which may slow down the development\nprogress.  Obtaining knowledge on the comets may help to avoid, or reduce the damage if the risks realize (i.e. the comet hit causing waves)\nin the future.  I changed my strategy\nseveral times until I get to the level 6 of the game.  The first times I played (from 1st  to 4th times), I focused on developing the community\nfirst, then doing the risk management (i.e. protection, research and insurance).  Normally I passed level 1 and failed at level\n2 after getting 1 or 2 damages caused by the comet hits. I changed my strategies after\nthat.  I kept the number of pods in\nthe community at 3 or 4 at the first two levels, while using the bank and the time I have to do more preparation for risk\nmanagement (i.e. improve protection, do more research or buy insurance).  Later on, when the bank grew up, I invested more in the pods and did more preparation for risk management simultaneously.  After getting to level 6 (which I failed at the latest attempt), I have learned the following main points from the game:  To develop, we need to\ntake risks (no pods, no damage). Resources for risk\nmanagement are limited, we may need the trade-offs among the different types of the resources.    Utilise time to learn\nabout the risk will help to improve protection significantly. Risk management is the\nkey component of developments. For sustainable development,\nwe need to balance the development level of the community and risk\nmanagement.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I can change or add one simple thing in this wonderful game, I would add the function \"Differentiation of the Position of the Pods\".  In the game, the locations of\nthe Pods are not really important.  All pods are located in the same place, contributing the same level of development to the community, and getting the same damage if the comets hit and cause waves.  Thus, I would\nlike to add the above-mentioned function to choose the location for the Pods.  For example, the pods located at higher place (e.g. a mountain) shall get less damages by the comets hit, while their costs are higher.  In addition, the money they bring up may higher while the costs for protecting them may also higher.    In this regard, the player may have a choice of where\nto locate the pods, what position should be better protected, and in an extreme case, the player may choose to abandon an individual location of pods when the comets come, for the development of the whole community. \n\n\n\nI believe risk\nmanagement choices should also include what region (in the community) to be\nprotected, and the level of protection as well.  Thus I\nbelieve the above function will better reflect risk management in the real\ncommunity.",

            "reflection": "The game is about assessing the “shocks” (meteors) and matching it against what resources you have or needed to have to mitigate damage and destruction. I have to play it many times before I was able to fully understand the dynamics and needed “skill” to succeed. Just like in the real world, if we are confronted with something that we have little knowledge of, we will end up “shocked”. But we learn from experience and the next time something similar happens we become more prepared. \n\nIn my first two games, I was buying an insurance – the premium one. But I learned that I don’t have to buy the insurance, I just have to study the meteor and/or increase protection while at the same time developing the pods. Basically, I just use the resources (money) to improve the pods and increase protection (raising the elevation). There are meteors that you just ignore because you have already enough protection to survive its impact. Another element that I was ignoring at first was the green indicator of progress at the left side of the screen. I didn't know what it was really for, until I started adding more pods and developing them, the indicator starts to rise according to the number and the development of the pods. I thought it would just advance (improve) in time…and all I have to do is just to prepare for the meteors. All in all, it is about managing resources - time and money to achieve the objective of surviving the meteors.  \n\nWith regards to the the changes that I want to make to the game, let me first describe where I am from and what is our current situation. \n\nI am from Zamboanga City, Philippines. Relative to the other parts of the Philippines, we seldom experience natural calamities and disasters, especially, storms and flooding. There is also no known active volcano in the area. However, what we enjoy in terms lesser natural and disasters and calamities is shadowed by the threat of peace and order. Just recently, our city was under sieged by a breakaway Muslim rebel group. This is something that the whole part of Southern Philippines is experiencing (in various degrees)– a constant conflict…unstable peace and order because of cultural and ethnic differences of the people and because of others who take advantage of the situation.  \n\nAnd so, if I am to make a simple change in the game, it will be adding dialogue or replacing insurance with dialogue. I feel that a constant dialogue between people of different tribes and cultures can bring about better understanding between them. Allowing people to be more tolerant, patient, and sensitive to other person's culture which in turn'll bring about harmony...and hopefully a lasting peace. \n",

In terms of trade-offs, depending on the severity of the hit, the research\ncomponent of risk management gives an edge over insurance since it provides a better\nassessment of the risk and more financial resources to upgrade the pods in\ncontrast with the upgrading the level of protection which is very costly. In\nregard to development, preparation for risk has a positive effect in the long\nterm as in the short term since it helps reduce the loss of lives and material resources\nimmediately and any perverse effect on economic growth in the long term.\n\nIndeed,\nI played the game many times to reach level 4 and after the first time I have focused\nmore on research or knowledge in order to have more resources to upgrade my\npods and therefore reduce the impact of the comets.  As I was progressing through higher levels,\nthe main things I have learnt from the game is that the better way to manage\nrisk is to: \n\n(a)     To do some research about\nthe threat in order to assess the severity of the risk;\n\n(b)     Raise the level of\nprotection either by buying insurance or most of all by upgrading the level of\ncommunity connection.\n\n \n\nFinally,\nif I had the opportunity to change or add a simple thing, I would propose that “Raising\nthe level of awareness about risks facing the most vulnerable” represent better\nthe risk management choice that matter in my country.",

You have to manage the risk of a flood, while investing enough in production to win the level and enough in protection for not losing for a flood caused by a meteor.  My strategy was based on investing a lot in development in the beginning ,  to gain some flow of knowledge and have the resources to apply. On the firs attempt I bought insurance, on my second one ( I won level 5 and the game crashed ) I did not buy insurance, I invested a lot in my buildings and always get the green bar with some time left, and than I studied the meteors and invested in protection according to the maximum impact of them. So I manage to win investing everything I could in development, nothing on insurance and no more than I needed on protection, that was the best optimization for me. With this combination I could reach the green bar with a lot of time left.The help between the development spots, ( the ones you had to click after the flood ) didn't make a lot of sense to me, because you gain protection after the meteor hit. The community can't help between the meteor fall and before the flood, they can help prevent and reconstructing. ",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection1.\nRisk management in the game was about balancing\ninvestment and expansion with knowledge, protection, and insurance.  I chose to build conservatively, investing in\ninsurance and balancing my time to maximize protection and knowledge.  By preparing for risk I had to delay building\nall my pods at once which in the short term slowed down my progress.  In the long term, however, because I was\ninvesting in insurance, carefully establishing protection and keeping a keen\neye on knowledge when the comets hit I was not badly damaged.  My subsequent pod expansion and upgrading was\nsafer and more resilient even when substantial comets hit.\n\n2.     \nAfter I played the game several times I became\nmore adept at achieving a balance between pod building and investing in\nknowledge, protection, and insurance. \nThe first time I was so concerned about risk that I failed because I was\nnot devoting enough time and resources to building pods and upgrading\nthem.  I was also overly concerned with\nprotection to the detriment of knowledge, or in the case of the game tracking\nthe comets.  The main things that I\nlearned from the game are that risk is calculated and there are as many\nnegative consequences to not investing enough of one’s resources in building as\nthere are to building without proper regard for risk.  I also realised that time is also a resource\nthat has to be invested wisely and that knowledge and protection are each\nequally important if an asset is to be secured. \nLastly I learned that community connections are the difference between\nlittle or no damage and complete destruction; therefore, it is vital for the\nsuccess of any large project to be part of a community.\n\n3.     \nIf I were going to add one thing to a new\nversion of the game I would make it health and social security insurance for\nthose that live in the pods.  I live in\nCanada where we have universal health care and social security and I know that\nsome of the risk of investing is mitigated by the knowledge that after a\ndisaster medical costs will not bankrupt an individual and there is a social\nsafety net to help individuals if a disaster means that work is temporarily\ndelayed.  We pay a high cost for this\nsocial insurance through taxes but it gives individuals the peace of mind to\nnot just build but also rebuild after a natural event.",

The social and economic investment's chances for a long lasting success must take into consideration the following factors:the nation's financial ability to meet the various costs associated with building such investment.the scope of the preparations: financial, insurance, technical and human resources.the role of the world bank in helping and offering assistance in case of a disaster.the role of international community to assist in real time.country's participation in an effective insurance system.These factors are very important in establishing an effective system of risk management. However, any nation must take into consideration the physical nature of its climate and land in order to reduce and minimize the negative impact of natural disasters, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. You need to build a stronger structure and better building code to ensure safety against the damaging effects of natural disasters.It takes a social responsibility and accountability to establish an effective risk management system. People at different level of national responsibility must work together to protect communities against natural events. For example, you don't build a nuclear reactor near an area that sits above an earthquake fault., or building factories near densely populated areas.Protecting the environment is an essential element in risk management. Deforestation is disastrous practice that leads to a great imbalance in the ecosystem. People must understand that they cannot go forever taking earth for granted. The best risk management starts with respecting the physical nature of earth.    ",

            "reflection": "1. Role of Risk ManagementThe \"risk horizon\" game provided a visual method of showing the importance of risk management techniques for risk mitigation. These were:Growth: ability to take risk by building pods to generate more revenueKnowledge: the importance of research and the ability to track probabilitiesProtection: methods of protecting pods from floods caused by cometsInsurance: use of insurance to enable rebuilding at lower costsCommunity: ability to band communities together to share risk and rewardKnowledge enabled buying protection and insurance based on probability. The result was the ability to better resource growth when probability of a comet hit was lower. It appeared that high growth with a lack of risk mitigation was an unsustainable strategy.2. What to do Differently When Playing AgainIt is not clear how the algorithms for knowledge, protection and insurance play out. In other words, the value per dollar spent on protection or insurance is not obvious when first playing the scenario. One needs testing by making the pod development the same in 2 games and adjusting for high protection/lower insurance in one and low protection/higher insurance in the other. Once protection and insurance return is understood, the next stage is to adjust for growth. The problem with this \"A-B\" testing approach is that it may help get better points in the game, but might be immoral in real life. For example, eliminating protection for flooding through insurance may result in far more deaths even if this was more economical.3. Recommended Change to the GameThe game could provide feedback about risk appetite. Game players are faced with examining risk probability as multiple comets fly overhead and deciding on growth, protection and insurance. It might be helpful in learning risk management to provide a risk matrix that shows users where their risk mitigation strategy falls in probability by impact when clicking on comets. This would be more useful than attempting to visualize probability by impact with the little bars. Users may get focused on probability rather than the combination of probability and impact. This may also require a little more explanation about the risk matrix in the course. This explanation would be helpful because the risk matrix is a very useful visual tool for evaluating risk and getting agreement in a group of people.",

All these methods have certain monetary\ncost (for example insurance costs certain amount of money), cost related to forfeited\nopportunities (for example when a player is engaged in research he or she\ncannot engage in other activities), or a combination of the two costs (for\nexample increasing protection with the slide bar costs money and results in\ntemporary forfeiture of development opportunities). \n\nI played the game multiple times and tested various risk\nmanagement strategies. First, I tried playing without any risk management, but\nconcentrated on building and upgrading pods only. This very quickly led to a\nloss in the game. Then, I tried to employ one of the risk management tools at\nthe time (knowledge, insurance, or protection). This usually led to a loss in\nlevels 1 or 2. Therefore, I realized that in order to succeed in the game, all\nrisk management strategies had to be employed and balanced at the same time. By\ndoing so I was able to reach level 4 of the game. It is also worth mentioning that the first few times I played the game, I did not feel comfortable enough to employ all risk management strategies at the same time. In particular, I struggled to understand the importance of comet research. \n\nWhile the game was really good at capturing, in a simplified\nway, various aspects of risk management, it suffered from one deficiency, in my\nopinion. Based on my experience with the game, it seems that it does not\npromote savings in any way. I was actually more successful when I fully used\nall the money at my disposal, as soon as it became available. I feel like\nhaving savings in the face of a serious risk is actually good, and provides a\nsafety cushion, which allows for a better recovery. Therefore, it would\nactually be nice to allow users to set some money aside so that it can be used\nto deal with the damage caused by comets. This would actually make it a little more realistic. \n\n",

Research\nincreases, while protection deletes it but continues to be useful even after\nzero. Preparing for risk impedes development and competes in the allocation of resources.\nHowever, the component of Research, Protection and Insurance were of a good help. However, they became stumbling block as well against time and resources. Research, took most of the time because the cursor has to focus on the comets and wait upon the progress. While doing so, another comet is coming in a short distance from the first. Insurance, plays a good bond, whenever unexpectedly been hit by a severe comets.I played it countless times and I would have been more\nconscious and careful with my combinations and to take more risk and study the\neffect and respond on it simultaneously. My first trial has been just for fun. But\nwhen I was hit and there is damage in my pods I slowly become serious and\nserious thinking strategies and combination. But been disappointed with the\nvery limited time given. Thus, when its comet free, it was also no time left to\nconstruct new pods or improve existing ones. I’ve learn in the game; balance, courage, coordination and\nguts. Balancing development and protection with the aid of research and\ninsurance, while keeping in mind the constraint of time and resources. Courage\nand guts, to try different strategies and combinations. Coordination, the whole\nthing has to be coordinated to be able to develop and protect the Alora.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I were to add something in the game, it would be Resilience.\nThat after being shocked, the place would be somehow recovers and be able to be\npositive in continuing growth.\n\nMaybe, I underestimate the whole\nthing and or I myself wasn’t prepared for a risk. However, Filipinos in real\nsense were resilient and very positive. So, if and only if the game shall be\navailable for long even after the quiz. I would love to re-take and will do my\nvery best to study the matters. It’s very interesting and challenging. My experience\nhas been a thriller and I am yes confused and shocked but happy to have tried\nit with my very best. I am certain to do it over and over again. Learning to be\nmore calm and think and be conscious of the factors affecting and will be\naffected. It’s a good thing to be reminded and to witness such catastrophe in\nthe game setting wherein adjustment could be done and correction in every\nerror.\n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "1. The game brought out the relevance of the risk management and\nthe application of available tools for development.\n\nWhile development is the KPI in this game, there are\nuncertainties which affect development. This game illustrated very well the application\nof risk management elements and tools viz. knowledge (research to gain that\nknowledge about events), protection by raising the level of pods, insurance and\ncoping (making community connections and having to rebuild the pods by saving\nahead for those repairs).\n\nThe trade-offs were quite apparent in the sense that you\nwould have less resources for development while you devote some towards\nprotection and insurance. I made a choice to start development immediately,\nprotect existing development by raising level to reduce damage and have\ninsurances in place for repairs, early on in the game. The initial costs\nrelated to protection and insurance far outweigh the benefits of damage from\ncomet hits later on.\n\nOne thing was, I invested in research as soon as I sighted a\ncomet on the horizon, so it gives more time to prepare and make community connections\nin the event it happens. Another thing I did, was to make sure there were some\n$ always available to make repairs – the lesser the damage.2. I should admit I did a few iterations to reach level 3 but haven’t\ncrossed it. So obviously, I haven’t got the development-resource-risk equations\nor the diversification part right. Perhaps I invested too much in protection\nand insurance. After the first attempt where I lost in level 2, I was trying\ndifferent combinations of resource allocation to development, protection and\ninsurance. The equations were not apparent and there was not enough time to\nfigure them out.\n\nIf I were to play only once I would try to broaden development\nfirst and then focus on protection and insurance in that order. It seems a\nlogical way to approach development in general. The uncertainties such as\nnatural disasters depicted in the game could result in any outcome but I think that\nthis approach could work in the long term as more development would more\nresources to protect, insure and cope.\n\nFor me, the game was quite insightful in thinking about my approach\nto the development problem (rather to life in general). My learning is that for\nsuccessful development, you have to figure out the development-resource-risk\nequations. Community connections are very important in expediting development\nby sharing knowledge and coping experiences.3. First of all, fantastic game with a lot of insights and practical\nrelation with life/development, in general. One thing I would like to add the\ngame is community connections before the event to share the coping experiences.\nI think if one were to have advance information about preventive actions and how\nto cope, one would be better placed to cope with the risks and outcomes.\n\nThis is the same change I would encourage to better manage\nrisk in my workplace and community at large. I believe we don’t have to reinvent\nthe wheel every time to discover solutions for successful development. We can\nlearn vicariously from others’ experiences and approaches. However, blindly\nfollowing others’ approach will not yield success. Every context has different\nequations and requires tailored solutions.",

            "reflection": "1. The game, simple as it is, teaches\none to maintain the proper balance between research, investment,\npreparation, insurance.\nThe risk management had the role to\ncorrectly assess the damage after being hit, to take the best\nmeasures for the less possible damage and for the better recovery.\nMy preferred choices were to research,\nbuy insurance and build, the trade-off being a slower development.\nThe impact on development was both\nshort and long-term, as the investments in research and insurance\nreduced the development speed but also the energy level was more\ndifficult to keep over time.\n\n2. I played the game several times,\ntrying to change parameters from one game to another. I started by\nfocusing on the quick development of the “town”, upgrading the\npods, then I decided towards the strategy of building as many pods as\npossible and neglecting to upgrade them. At the beginning I observed\nthat it is difficult to withstand the damage received by the\nbuildings, and that research is an important part of the process. I\nfound out that no matter how well developed the “town” is,\nneglecting the community is a bad idea: community connection can help\nyour long term protection. By connecting to neighbors and community\nyou manage to decrease the shock and of course the impact that the\nrisk will have on the community, so I invested more in research to\nallow me more time to develop the mutual support of the pods.\nObviously, the first step I did at the\nbeginning of each level was the insurance. It costs more and slows\nthe upgrading down but the repair costs are lower and it looks better\nwhen you draw the line at the end. I also tried to the raise the\nplatform to a level that does not influence my research time very\nmuch but together with the research allows the best protection.\n\n3. Since the primary threat is comets,\nI would add one single item: a weapon that can be used to blast off a\ncomet before it hits the sea once per level, so the comet assessed as\nthe biggest threat would be eliminated.\nHowever, to maintain the balance of the\ngame, I would condition the firing of the gun with a drop of the\nplatform level.\nThe changes I would propose concerning\nthe risk management choices that matter in the area I live would\ninvolve the climate induced risks, such as floods, heavy rains or\nsnows, fires due to storms.\nI would improve real estate insurance\nstrategies, I would increase prevention for damages produced by\nstorms, hurricanes, heavy rains.\nI would focus on building new dams or\nimprove the existing ones to prevent floods.",

            "reflection": "Greeting from Alora!While Alora is not a real place, the choices are!  Basically, the game is an illustration of \"scarcity.\"  It is a story of asset allocation and risk mitigation.  It is an exercise in lowering \"shocks\" (comet crashes) and increasing prosperity (pods and pod upgrades).  The game, RiskHorizon, uses very limited but effective variables to teach these lessons.  The player can choose different risk allocation by changing their choices in the game.  Game choices for risk mitigation are:  1) knowledge, 2)  protection, and 3)  insurance.  The assets to be allocated are:  1)  wealth and 2)  time (after all the game is timed and you only have a certain time to reach the desired goal).  Accordingly, a player must constantly make trade-off choices between the various risk mitigation safeguards while effectively maximizing their asset allocations.  For example, a player can gain \"knowledge\" on a comet by simply clicking on the comet in question.  This builds up \"connection time\" should the comet actual strike and allows for risk mitigation in that way; however, while a player is engaged in this \"knowledge\" pursuit, they can not do any other activities as their cursor is \"locked\" on the comet---so, the players cost is time.  This is only one example of the myriad of choices that this simple, yet effective, game teaches.I played the game multiple times, varying strategies each time.  I constantly struggled with the question:  Is it better to build several small pods or a few larger ones?  Is it better to have more insurance or more time (\"knowledge\") for community linkage?  In the beginning,  I took the approach that I would just build out as quickly as possible and take my chances with the comets (what the financial analysis would call a \"risk on\" approach).  The results were not good, and it quickly became clear to me that attempts to \"overpower\" the risk by simply attempting to \"out-grow\" the resource problem would not work.  In order to experience any long term success (to reduce the \"shocks\"), I had to engage in all elements the game allowed for risk mitigation---insurance (often at the 75% level), knowledge (often building up the maximum community connection time), and protection (raising the cities level above the sea).  If I could redesign the game, I think I would try to increase the \"knowledge component\" of the game.  It would be a \"super-knowledge\" component where it not only cost time but a great deal of wealth---maybe this would be like a \"comet shield\" or \"under ground/water\" pods.  The protection afforded by this \"super knowledge\" component would be higher (perhaps complete), but it would have a high ongoing expense to maintain. However, while this may enhance the choices and outcomes, it would not change the basic principles of economics at the core of the game:  all resources have a scarcity factor; diversification produces better overall risk mitigation; and, at some point, virtually every action has a point of diminishing returns.Signing out from Alora!",

            "reflection": "The risk horizon game is a beautiful representation of the importance of risk management in real life for individuals, firms and societies. In real world, risk can be perceived and experienced by entities because of a wide array of probable and possible events and similarly there are gamut of risk mitigation and management strategies that are available. The game succinctly classifies the various risk mitigation strategies under the labels of research, protection and insurance.I played the more than once as I had difficulty understanding how to reach the next levels in the first few instances of the game. However, I realized the importance of the various options of risk mitigation by the end of the third iteration of the game and could reach level 5 in the fourth instance of my game. The wide range of choices and trade-offs I had to make to pass each level amazed me. I will try to explain what I had learned through my decision making process in the game in the next couple of paragraphs.To start with, I had to first make the choice of how many pods I have to build in the first couple of levels as I had a limit on the amount of money I could spend on building them as well as upgrading them. After building a few pods in the first few levels, I had to focus on the risk mitigation strategies based on the severity, chance of impact and speed at which the comets were arriving. I focused mainly on playing safe by protecting Alora by investing in insurance and protection before even the comets started to fall on the island. In fact I have realized that protection was more effective than research in the instance of my game. Research was equally (or slightly less) important as it reduced the damage due to the impact.To sum up, I focused on these issues in this order (first one most important)1. Protection2. Insurance3. Development and Expansion of Pods on the Island4. Research Thanks to the team for conceptualizing such a nice game. The game in itself was very good but if I was given a chance to modify or make a change to the game, I would bring in some spatial and temporal elements. Disruption risk events do not impact each place in a region equally and recovery from these events also takes different amount of time for different places in a region. This would also mean changes in the protection and insurance levels for different pods at different places on the island.For example, if Alora was placed as an island in the middle of the sea and comets keep falling at different places, how would an individual make choices on levels of protection, insurance and research. This would add slight level of complication to the game but nevertheless would be interesting according to me.",

            "reflection": "1.  The role of risk management in the game was preparing for the potential disaster (shock) caused by the falling comets.  While building and upgrading pods, I also increased protection, did research on comets (enhance knowledge), and purchased insurance.  The preparation for risk affected development by reducing the damages caused by the falling comets.  For example, by continuing research on comets and increasing protection, the damages caused by the falling comets could be minimized. By clicking on the comet and keeping its box focused on the screen, I was able to accumulate research.  Doing research on the comets will also provide knowledge on the chance of hitting and severity of potential damages.  Using the knowledge, i increased protection and purchased insurance accordingly.  Because of the accumulated research, there is more time for creating community connections.  When the falling comets hit, the damages could be reduced.  However, sometimes, there could still be some damages.  The insurance could help cover part of the cost for rebuilding the damaged pods.  2.  I played the game more than once.  At first, I didn't really pay attention to research on the falling comets.  Thus, initially, I only increased protection and purchased insurance in preparation for the potential damages that could be caused by the falling comets.  However, after I found out about clicking on the comet and keeping its box focused on the screen to accumulate research, I did that and was able to reduce damages significantly.  Moreover, when I see a comet with a potential for severe damages, I increased protection level even further and purchased insurance to cover the potential risk of damages.  By doing so, I was able to minimize the damages caused by the falling comets. I learned that it is important to balance development (building and upgrading pods) with risk management (preparing for the damages caused by the comets).3. If I am tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows me to change or add one simple thing, I would propose to add the risk of scarcity or depletion of natural resources available for building the pods (materials needed to build the pods).   This could potentially increase the cost of the materials for building the pods.  One way to solve the problem would be to use alternative materials that are more abundant.  This may require research for new technology and innovation to find methods and materials that are more accessible and sustainable.",

By \npurchasing insurance I was able to cover the damage caused by the accidents.  I \nhad only limited financial resources and short time to invest in different \nactivities (like building pods). I could not do everything that I \nwished for. A balanced view on preventive actions and insurance and community building seemed to be the \nbest way. I think in real life the situation is like this, and people (and policy makers) need to think \nhow to use limited resources in the best possible way. There was a time gap between \nthe protection and development, so the results were not visible right away. That made the cause-effect relationhip more difficult to understand first.\nI played the game many times, and as things in life usually go, practice \nmakes perfect.  I needed to read the instructions again when I noticed I still didn't know how to play well. I learnt many things after the first trials and always adjusted \nmy actions for the future strategies. For example, I learnt that I don't need to \nsave my money but instead should invest more in developing the community.  Only \nafter I did that, could I move on to the next level. If I should change something in \norder to make the game better, I would show the instructions somehow better in \nthe beginning. People must have a good knowledge on things in order to know what to do. This would in real life translate into having an education on the topic of risk management and tools related to that (either formal or informal education). I think also trial and error teaches us a lot, but knowing the rules of the game, i.e. being educated on important things in advance, is vital in my opinion. Overall, I learnt quite a lot from this game. Most important lesson I learnt was that I should study instructions before I start something, i.e. have an education or training in real life. That changes a lot.",

            "reflection": "The game shows that risk management is dynamic. It is necessary an optimum resource application. Even with a good strategy, time is a very important issue. You can´t focus on a rapid development without taking care mainly of your protection. There was a\nclear trade-off situation between development and protection (competing for\ntime) and also between development (either in upgrading or building new plots) and\ninsurance. During the investment in protection development freezes, so it is\nnecessary to invest in the right time. I´ve chosen for maintaining a high level\nof protection (around 6 bars after level 2), keeping only a 33% level of\ninsurance and trying to upgrade the plots and observing the comets all the\ntime. After I´ve reached the wealth needed for the next level I started\ninvesting in protection. The first time I´ve invested in lots of plots right\nfrom the beginning, 50% of insurance and not much in protection (around 4\nbars). After 2 or 3 times, I´ve started investing more in protection, upgrading\nthe plots and ‘researching’ more to get more time for the connections. I´ve\nlearned that repair is expensive (both in time and money), research is ‘cheap’\nand development must be smooth.\n\nI´d add a social aspect, giving one more\ninvestment option (e.g. infrastructure and health) to force the player thinking\nboth in internal and external issues. I´d also change the research aspect, it\nshould be cumulative to reinforce that education is a long-term investment.",

            "reflection": "In this game, it was the most important to handle preparation for risk and dont let meteors to damage your community. I played it two times and in the second attempt I decided to purchase only 33% insurance every round, because I found out, that it too expensive and I rather spent my money to preparation and building and upgrading my pods and community. And further I found out, that I dont have to spend all my money to make the best protection for my community, but I rather decided to make a research every time a new meteor appeared in the sky. When there weren't any meteors, I focused only on building new pods and upgrading them to make more profitable community and my protection was average. 1. Preparation for risk affect development after some time, especially, when more big meteors (it means meteors with large probability of hit and large severity) came in the same time.  In this game was the role of risk management very important, becaus without preparation it would lead to many shocks and the community could not be developed. I described my choices above this answer.2. Like I wrote above, i didnt buy the most expensive insurence every time, but only the cheapest one, because when I realized, that if I take care about preparation very well, I dont have to have any damage on my pods. Second time, I didnt try to make the perfect protection, but only to the point, that was required. It was necessary to check the severity of every meteoir and make a lot of research if some of them had significantly higher severity then my actual protection.  I learned from this game, that preparation, research and  insurance are more important that i thought and it is convenient to invest my money into that, even when it is not easy to implement in real world. I will think about that in my life.3. I would definitely add some information about upgrades. When I played this game, I didnt know, whether I should prefer to build a new pod or upgrade one of the existing ones. And I would make text tutorial too, because when i wanted to find one sentence from tutorial, i didnt want to play the whole tutorial one more time.That is all. Thanks for a game and very instructive course to its creators. ",

For starters, it has\nput me in a situation where I have had to balance many different issues,\nhowever small in amount, to achieve the growth required in the limited time\ngiven. It has opened my eyes to how important these decisions can be,\nespecially in terms of what is given up in return for development. \n\n                For\nexample, at the beginning of the game, I gave each element equal importance,\nand failed miserably by the end of level 2 or 3. However, when I gave very\nlittle importance to research, and cut down my insurance by one level, I was\nable to maintain the growth the game required of me in the limited time.\n\n                The\nmain things I learned from this game was how important certain aspects of the\nresources given allows you to judge what is more important. I did give\nprotection quite a bit of my attention, but by level I increased it and relied\non community connections to make up for the shortcomings.\n\n                If I\nwere to add a simple element to this game to make it more realistic to where I\nlive, I would add the human element. I think we rarely look at how human behaviour\naffects the outcomes of risk management. With insurance, adequate protection\nand even research, human behaviour matters greatly. If the population is\nunhappy, the effort they would give to rebuild and develop would be mediocre,\nto say the least. I believe adding that extra ‘population response/happiness’\nwould add more challenge to the game instead of just increasing the number and\npace of meteor hits.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "1. Role of risk management: Once there are 1 or 2 communities created, purchase the most amount of insurance that can be afforded, while keeping some money in case repairs are needed. Increase protection in small increments once 1 or 2 communities are created.  This provides incremental protection in the event of a hit. Over time, as I have more money to increase protection, my communities are better shielded from hits, and they take lesser damage. I have more time to make connections when I am hit and often are able to completely mitigate damage.In time, knowledge in the form of accuracy about meteor severity and chance to hit helped me decide when to ignore a meteor completely and focus on community building (allowing the bar to turn green).2. I played it more than once. What would I do differently next time? Build slowly. Ensure that building and protection are being built at the same time.  The first time, I grew my communities too quickly and I was unable to provide enough protection when struck by a severe hit. Expand communities (increase level) slowly too. After building or growing each community, wait to make sure the bar can turn green before building/expanding more. Always buy insurance. 3. What change would I make to better represent management choices that are relevant to where I live:Biggest risk: Risk of systemic financial shock coupled with high risk of earthquakes common to this part of the world (California Bay Area).  While systemic financial risk is not specific to where I live, the housing market in this area is very closely tied to the financial economy. I fear a major earthquake, which has been predicted to be long overdue for this area, coupled with a simultaneous shock to the financial market, which would in turn affect the high-tech industry (main-stay industry in this area), would cripple the economy here. Many will be out of work, unable to pay mortgages, forced to abandon or foreclose, etc. To reflect this in the game, the game could introduce unforeseen earthquakes. Since earthquakes are not easily predicted in real life, the fact is we never know when the big one will hit. In the game, there would be no way to achieve the right level of protection for it.  Some scenarios in the game can feature earthquake-only hits, with random levels of severity. Other scenarios can represent the culmination of a large financial shock and an earthquake (or several small earthquakes to represent a series of aftershocks), which will likely send the player scrambling to regroup the resources, and hoping there is enough money saved up for necessary repairs, sufficient insurance to mitigate damage, and some level of protection to reduce damage caused.",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection: Risk Horizon GameThe role of risk management in the\ngame was in the same line as the World Development Report, they both agreed. It\nfocus its importance in preventive actions, information to reach a better\nunderstanding of the problems and their possible outcomes through research (knowledge), protection from defensive mechanisms and the community power,\nthrough actions to diminish the likelihood or size of the impact; and copying\nwith damages or losses in bad times, thanks to the insurance through effective reparation (these are actions to\ntransfer resources to the most affected sectors). Among the strategies I used to\nachieve better results, I start purchasing the most inclusive insurance, I kept\na constant medium level of protection at least, especially in the periods when\nthere were no imminent risks,  and I did\nas much “research” as I could, to maximize the level of knowledge. Preparation for risk definitely worked better in\nthe medium-long term, when the three elements (knowledge, protection and\ninsurance) were at a good functioning level. In a low level, consequences were\nmuch more negative and severe. So preparation for risk affect development later,\nafter some time.To answer the second block of\nquestions, I played the game few times and I have tried different strategies: I\ngave more or less importance to several options, discovering that research\nusually helps the most ,along with insurance, to minimize the negative effects,\nto the point of even avoiding them. The first time I played, I tried to\nincrease the protection over research, but I found over time that it was not\neffective. The main thing I learned from the game support the leaning process\nin this course: One interesting thing that I have learnt is that despite some\nmedium level protection interfaces, community power could really have a good\nimpact in mitigating the damages; this is, through communication, mutual\nsupport and preparation. Also, I noticed risk is variable, and it is important\nto research and pay attention to all kinds constantly: slow, non-frequent\nevents could be as damaging as quick or repeated threats. To me, the wave\nindicates the consequences of this negative event, so it represents the  harmful consequences. After those, community\ncame back to a previous stage of protection (less good), which outlines the necessity\nfrom the state to revise constantly this methods, keeping them up to date,\nimproving them, to maximize the benefits for the community and to minimize potential\nlosses. Besides, placing myself on the policy making side, on the\nadministrative side, on the high responsible side I realize about one thing:\nthere is never enough time, risk is constant and there is no idyllic risk planning,\nit should be done at the same time as the population develops, it is not to be\npostponed.Answering the third question, if I\ncould give some ideas to improve a new version of this game  I would introduce risks of different natures,\nsuch as socio-economic, for example an economic recession; or related to\nhealth, illness for instance. In the game the risks are simplified to natural\ndisasters and in reality we experience broad, complex, different kind of risks.\nThe way they are tacked varies, so I guess it would result very interesting to\nmake it a bit more complex.",

            "reflection": "The risk management game combined situations of an economy needing to build up it's infrastructure while gaining knowledge about the environment. It was, at times, a tricky balance knowing when to build-out the community versus research a potentially catastrophic event. One of the ways I chose to mitigate risk was by always purchasing the highest quality insurance at the start of each new level of the game. Though sometimes expensive, it allowed me to focus my time on knowledge and protection. By allocating insurance funds at the start of the level I didn't have to spend my time worrying about whether my properties would be destroyed/ critically damaged when the next comet hit because if they were I would have the funds to repair.The first few times that I played the game I didn't research the incoming comets. Once I understood how important the research portion of the game was I was able to maximize my research time based on the severity/ chance of hit.  I live in a flat area of the United States. The region sees many tornadoes, often occurring spontaneously, providing little time to react. Our community has installed warning sirens. When the siren sounds, everyone makes their way to the basement. This, in some ways, represents the protection bar. The largest differences here would be damage faced based on infrastructural damage versus the damage a community would face with human fatalities. Luckily, the game doesn't try and quantify these things -- providing a simpler \"percentage damaged\" statistic. This is where the game and reality heavily differ. A risk manager, in any part of the world, will have many more complex factors to consider when identifying risk management strategy's.  The game also allowed for infrastructural development. Though not mentioned, this may signify the development of technology, health care, education etc. A community that is developing may be able to get to a point of specialization thus, allowing for faster research, better transfer of knowledge/ protection, and a generally more streamlined ability to grow. This wasn't well represented in the game. Both, knowledge and protection, grew at the same rate from level 1 through level 6. This, of course was an oversight needed for simplicities sack but, may actually play in the favor of reality. By creating this simplified world we have been able to further understand the need for balance, to combine the need to develop infrastructure while also mitigating risk.",

            "reflection": "Risk management was an obvious and important part of the\nRisk Horizon game. The easiest and least costly form of protection was to keep\nthe Comet info screen open, as to increase the quantity of research. It was my\nstrategy to have, whenever the game required no action on my part, to have to\ncomet with the highest impact or highest probability open, as to increase my\nprotection if/when the comet would hit Alora. A second part of risk management\nwas protection, in the form of raising the island. Every level I tried to\nincrease the amount of protection by 1 or 2 bars, as indicated in the game. The\nprotection combined with the research had a significant effect on the risk\nmanagement of the island. My island was only hit by a few comets with minimal\ndamage. However, on the instances that a comet with high severity and high probability\nof impact would appear, I would purchase insurance, mostly for 75% of the costs. I think that in the 6\nlevels, I only purchased insurance three times. The other levels I would have\nsufficient protection to keep comets at bay. Furthermore, when these high severity and high probability comets would appear, I would stop investing in the island as to generate enough reserves to be able to quickly rebuild the island after the hit. If the comet did not create damage, then the money I had saved would be quickly invested in the island, sometimes upgrading as many as 4 buildings at the same time.\n\nI played the game several times and I changed my strategy slightly\nbetween the games. In the first few games I constantly bought insurance,\nwasting both money and decreasing protection. After realizing my strategy was\nnot working, I switched to investing more in protection and only buying\ninsurance if the risks faced by Alora were very high. I also had the bad luck\nof getting very severe impact comets in the last 10 seconds of the game, not\ngiving me enough time to rebuild the island, even with insurance. \n\nIf I would recommend one change to the game, I would suggest\nadding a third factor of protection. The research conducted in the current game\nis only relevant for 1 comet. I would suggest giving the player the option to\ninvest money in a ‘research center,’ which would increase the speed of research\nfor all individual comets. The center could have 4 levels, of which level 1 and\n3 would increase the speed of research, and level 2 and 4 would create an ‘early\nwarning system’ making the research into any comet start at 1 bar, rather than\n0. The addition of this research center would be modest, but would make the\ngame a closer reflection of a real life situation.\n\n",

            "reflection": "In the Risk Horizon game, we have to allocate resources (money and time) between development and risk preparation. If too much money is spent on risk preparation and not enough on development, we will not be able to hit the development milestones in time.  On the other hand, if we spent too much money on risk preparation such as insurance and protection, we do not have enough resources to develop and upgrade the pods.  A balance has to be found between development, research, protection and insurance at each level.  For the first 4 levels, I put more emphasis on development (building new pods) and raising the island to increase protection.  In terms of research, I would only spend time on research when the chance of comet hit is high and when severity exceed the level of protection of the island.  With the island raised high enough to protect itself from almost all comet hits, I did not spend any money on insurance as my focus was on long term development and protection.  Unfortunately, I could only reach level 4 but I can see insurance being more important in higher levels as number of falling comets increases.I played the game a handful of times.  My first attempt put too much focus on development and neglected risk management.  Each comet hit would set development back enough to lose the level.  In subsequent attempts, I allocated resources to protection (raising the island) and research to minimize chance and severity of damage.  Risk management can minimize damages and shorten development setbacks.  Long term development needs the support of risk management in order to be sustainable.  Natural disaster can wipe out development progress in blink of an eye, developing countries need to invest in risk management to ensure their long term growth.I live in the pacific coast of North America where a major (9+ scale) earthquake happening in the next few decades is a real possibility.  While development continues at a rapid pace in the city, enough protection and risk management has to be put in place to minimize casualties and damages in case of earthquake or tsunami.  If I am allowed to add one simple thing to the game, I will introduce the element of popular in to the game.  In the real world, there cannot be development without people.  Insurance can only replace the monetary loss and damages, not human lives.  Without protection and research, insurance alone is not sufficient in terms of risk management.  There is no point having all the money and resources without people.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game about risk management is a fun and\neducational game.  The point of the game\nis to reach developmental targets within a set time limit by building pods while\nprotecting the community from damages by comets. Using money to buy and upgrade\npods, buy insurance, or increase protection, there are trade-offs to be\nmade.  Tradeoffs include building\nprotection temporarily stopping my development meter from increasing,\nresearching the comet preventing me from building more protection, or building\nmore pods and upgrading them which increases the cost of insurance. Events occur\nin real time so decisions need to be made quickly.  I learned during the tutorial that spending\nmoney only on one aspect of the game, such as pods, will quickly lead to\nfailure without looking at the entire problem I am facing.\n\nMy strategy at the beginning of the game was to quickly buy\npods and some protection. While waiting for pods to build, I would research the\ncomets to ensure that my protection was good enough, and I would purchase more\npods to gather more income when I felt safe. \nI found that building a lot of pods and protection early made it easier\nin later parts of the game to upgrade and take no damage when comets actually\nhit.  Preparing early for risks negated\nany damages I would have experienced and this allowed me to quickly reach\ndevelopment goals in each level of the game.\n\nIf I were to play the game again, I probably would not\nchange my approach since I completed all of the levels. I didn’t find a need to\nbuy insurance if I kept my protection at maximum levels, and early upgrades for\npods meant that I had a very high income to further upgrade pods and recover my\nprotection when comets did hit.  However,\nif the game continued on and higher severity comets began arriving at higher\nfrequencies, I would be more inclined to purchase insurance to compensate for\nthe lack of time I would have had to prepare my defences against the hits.\n\nI learned that minimizing risk is extremely important, and\ninvesting for risk today pays dividends in the future. I am sure that if I did\nnot properly balance out building up pods with protection, I would have run out\nof money quickly and failed to reach my development goals.  Focusing only on one task while not looking\nat all factors that would impact my work as a whole would likely lead to\ndisaster.\n\nIf I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I\nwould add some more interactions that would force the purchase of\ninsurance.  For example, upgrading many\npods impacts the environment in such a way that all comet impacts hit with higher\nseverity, or high pod upgrades force the protection to be depleted faster. This\nwould demonstrate that our actions have consequences, and if we tamper with one\nelement too much it can impact other elements negatively.  Having some comets that we cannot protect\nourselves from would also force the purchase of insurance. We cannot protect\nourselves from everything in life, but we can mitigate the impacts of these\nsituations when they do occur.",

            "reflection": "Risk management had very critical role in the development of Pods. Risk management helped mitigate the  risk and allowed development to continue. Research provided knowledge to prepare against the comet. Protection provided physical protection for minimizing the impact. Insurance took off high costs for repairs. Knowledge of the risk i.e. severity of the comets, potential damage covered by flexible insurance cover, and protection measure to increase the platform height were pivotal. I utilized little knowledge,  more insurance and lots of protection to mitigate the risk. Preparation paid off after sometime as first comet caused damage but pods were repaired before next comet hit. Costs were taken care by insurance. More research allowed more time to update communities which was very crucial to minimize the risk.If I played game differently, I would try to do more research and start applying protection immediately. I would choose minimum insurance plan at the start and change it before comet hits based on severity and possibility of hitting. Pod development would continue meanwhile. I would develop existing pods to next levels so that green barometer levels are achieved faster and development momentum is maintained.I learnt that effective risk management for development is right combination of knowledge of the danger, protection from potential damage and proper insurance to cover monetary losses. The concept can be applied for all kinds of risks we face in our lives. Preparation is the key!One change I would like to have in the new version of the game is to have coordinated system for doing research and applying protection accordingly. So that I can put resources for doing research while utilizing the real-time knowledge to apply protection measures accordingly well well within time. ",

            "reflection": "The role risk management was to manage the development of a community and to prepare this community to confront risks. In the game we learnt in a practical way how important is:-manage resources: mainly in terms of economic resources and time investment. Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages. -manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks. -invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis. -the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles. The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risksThe game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones.     In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, \" Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity\". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community. ",

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game? What\nchoices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of\nknowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk\naffect development?\n\n Risk Management had\nan extremely important role in the game. While on one hand, the objective was\nto maximize the growth and development (of the pods), on the other, it was about\nensuring that the risks (damage caused by comets) be minimized, efficiently. Thus\nthe role of knowledge (research), protection, and insurance was critical. The\nchoices that I made related to using knowledge (research on comets) to\ndetermine how I should spend funds on protection and how much should be covered\nusing insurance. Since all three options costs money, the core trade-offs had\nto be made on the amount that I can spend on buying research, insurance and\nprotection while at the same time ensuring development. Preparation for risk\nwas directly related to the development; the better prepared we were, the rate\nof development, either in the short or long run, was also higher.\n\n If you played the game only once, what would you do\ndifferently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game\nmore than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the\nmain things you learned from the game?\n\n When the first time\nI played the game, I went ahead and immediately bought the most expensive\ninsurance to protect the planet against the destruction caused by comets. Later\non I realized that I could do better by first examining the severity and probability\nof the impact and the level of development that I have (high level pods costs\nmore to repair) and then deciding on the amount of funds to be spent on buying\ninsurance. Therefore the main things that I learned from the game were:\n\n 1.    \nThe role\nof research is very important in decision making (about investing either in development or buying or ensuring protection) and the knowledge about disasters play a very\ncrucial role in managing them\n\n2.    \nAny\nexpenditure on infrastructure development has to be backed by protection\nmeasures and insurance. However, the decision on how much to spend depends on the\nlevel of knowledge that we have about the disasters: the higher the knowledge,\nbetter would be the utilization of funds\n\n3.    \nIf\ndisasters are managed properly, the rate of development is also higher;\nhowever, the highly developed infrastructure requires high level of risk\nmanagement and protection.\n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of\nrisk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the\ngame, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you\npropose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the\nplace you live?\n\nThe country, in\nwhich I have lived, has a very high level of corruption. This corruption not\nonly undermines the development process, it also inhibits ensuring protection against\nnatural disasters or other types of shocks. Thus, if I were to develop a new\nversion of the game, I would include a mechanism for capturing this aspect. One\nway of doing this may be by using a corruption meter which changes according to\nthe right or wrong decisions that we make in the game. For example, if we buy\ncostly insurance for a disaster with low severity level and low probability of\nimpact, then this may reflect high corruption and the player may be penalized\nin some way, probably by lowering the development to a certain level.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "I played the game several times before successfully reaching level four, so I'll address questions 1 and 2 together.I do not expect that any single \"recipe\" can guarantee success in all repetitions of the game, but playing the game several times gave me a better sense of what I needed to focus on at different points in the game. I think initially I was a little too \"timid\" in starting the development process, but, in fact, at the start the game provides us with a relatively large amount of cash and until a substantial amount of development is done there is really not \"much to loose\", which means the needs for protection is small, so, in subsequent replays, I became a more aggressive \"developer\" in the initial stages of the game. As the value of the developed property increased, I also shifted my risk management strategy to a steady, progressive increase in the protection level (to 5-6) as the best \"first line of defense\", This, together with a reasonable amount of \"research\", allowed me to \"ignore\" a good number of less threatening \"comets\" and optimize the speed of further development. Only when a comet with a potentially very severe (7 or higher) impact appeared did I purchase the highest insurance I could afford. Overall this strategy worked well, allowing me, in the last round I played, to comfortably meet the targets up to level four (I have not yet tried the higher levels).Withe regard to question 3:One thing that was not clear to me in the game were the rules related to the rate of increase/replenishment in \"liquidity\" (cash) that could be used for further development or risk management. In particular it was not clear to what extent this was this process was \"random\" and to what  extent the earlier development choices made affected the rate of accumulation and/or replenishment of available cash. From a financial standpoint this is critical, as one needs to match the timeline of expected receivable cash-flows and payments (financial assets and liabilities), allowing for \"uncertainty\"  (comets). I think clarifying this aspect of the game so that the player can take \"financing\" explicitly into account would make the game richer. and more realistic. Along similar lines, adding a \"credit\" option could be interesting: for example the player could be allowed to drown a credit line equivalent to a percentage of available collateral, the \"developed property\", with some appropriate \"rate of interest\".",

            "reflection": "Risk Management was an essential aspect of winning each level in this game, as the planet was constantly facing the risk of annihilation with comets. Raising the level of the planet, buying insurance to protect the revenue stream and doing research on the comets were all part of risk management. In terms of choices or trade-offs, I had to decide early in the game if I should spend the money on insurance or building more pods. Later it was a choice between raising the level of the planet at a growing cost versus upgrading the pods. I also had to trade off comet research with raising the level of the planet as both had a benefit in terms of protecting the planet from damage. Preparation for risk hampered development of pods, as while I was raising the level of the planet, further development used to stop, or while I was researching the comets, it was difficult to focus on upgrading the pods.As I played the game multiple times, I learned that there was a fine balance between meeting the revenue generation target to cross each level and having sufficient risk management in place to survive severe damage from comets which sometimes set me back by a lot. After the first time I tried to sequence my pod development, insurance purchase, raising the level of the planet and researching the comet such that I could do a little bit of everything in the limited amount of time which was made available for each level. The main thing I learned from the game was balancing risk management with revenue generation so that a catastrophic event would not cause irreparable damage to my prospects of success.One useful thing for a player would be to get a summary of how much does each pod and an upgraded pod help with revenue generation so an individual can optimize the amount of money to spend on that versus purchase of insurance or raising the level of the planet. Another feature could be to provide some statistics or commentary on what other people have struggled with so players can learn from each others mistakes. Also, the game should allow storing past scores as during my first round I reached level 5 without noting down the codes assuming that after I lose a level I will get the code for my last few levels which I have crossed. In the absence of that feature I had to play again all the way from the beginning which had limited benefit for me from a learning point of view.",

            "reflection": "To start to\ntalk about what I learned with the Game, first I need to say that I’m not a\n“Game Player” person, so I don’t have any track record on this field, and I suppose\nthis is the reason of my lack achievement on the game result.Saying that, what I learned at first point is that, if we want to have a protected community, we need to focus on infrastructure for the inhabitants, building safe houses, strengthening its own infrastructure in order to face a threat in a more resilient way, reducing time and resources to rebuild it afterwards the disaster.The second lesson that I learned was about the knowledge necessary about the what kind of threat the community could face more likely than others (in the case of the game was the \"comet\"), when we know in depth what could or would threat our community, we can provide the proper protection in order to prevent the event, get good preparedness and readiness for facing the threat, and when it really happen, our community would be able to recover from it in a better way, using the proper resource and rebuild it in less time with fewer efforts and fewer damages. So, getting together all the relevant information about the threat, using data from research and the observance of the previous events, allow the community to get ready to face the threat, and make them recovering faster and cheapest than whether all this would occur without this knowledge.The third lesson learned from the game was about the insurance. When we are able to get the better coverage for our community, we can face the threat more easily, because we don't need to use all the resources that we have to rebuild from the event, the cost will be shared with the others members of the community, making easier to recover after the event hit the community.The last lesson learned was about the integration of all strategies to make the community stronger to face a shock, because if the community have all the information related to the threats it faced, combining with the protection action as reinforce the infrastructure or building a good alarm system and training people for using preventing disasters tools, and be able to share all these systems in a coordinate way, and furthermore having a good insurance coverage, the members of the community created a very good plan of alternatives that reduce the damages and make them stronger getting a very good resilient strategic plan and actions, reducing the efforts to rebuild the day-by-day life of the community after facing the shock, including reducing damages at social, economic and finance levels.",

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the\ngame? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms\nof knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk\naffect development?\n\nThe first\ndecision was how to play, the strategy would be different between repeated\ngames and a one time game, if the goal is to reach as high as possible.\nRepeated games allows you to take more risks early.\n\nI decided\nto view it as a “one shot” game as that would make the simulation more\nrealistic. This also would mean that I had limited experience of the variables\ninvolved.\n\nI started\nout developing level two buildings on about half the area, then pumped up the\nprotection, probably higher then needed. So, I had a short term weakness for\nimpacts at the start of round one, then fairly high level of built in resilence\nlater on.\n\nThis more\nor less allowed me to “check green status” on the left and build/protect\nwithout any fails for a long time; balancing protection vs. growth. I\neventually lost at round 5; a 2 impact combo made me to slow to rebuild.\n\nThe choice\nin the early rounds is mostly if you want to overdevelop or overprotect, and I\nfor the most part did the latter, that reduced the overall  optimal growth path a little, making later\nrounds harder, but also increases the probability you actually make it to later\nrounds.\n\n                               \n\n \n\nChanges\nin gameplay in the future\n\nThe\nresearch bit is ”free” in terms of money, as you actually have two recourses in\nthe game, money and time. On replay I would probably do more research on each\npossible impact event generally, but focusing on high impact events. As I had to learn while\nplaying, I spent a lot of time on “nothing” as in using the interface for other\nthings.\n\nI would\nalso try to observe more closely, the building to income connection, and how\nprotection is reduced by impacts. The latter is very important at high levels\nof protection as it takes both money and time to gain that back. Those are the\nfrontiers that limit development, more or less. At higher levels of protection\nand game levels (higher) insurance might be more optimal, in part.\n\nI have a\nbackground both in economics, risk management (financial), gaming and game\ndesign, so I mostly viewed this as very meta, as in what are they trying to achieve.\n It would be very hard for me to view\nthis game with fresh eyes.\n\n \n\n\n\nChanges\nin game mechanics\n\nYou can\nmake the economy slightly more complicated, instead of one input\n(buildings/machines) you could ad population (I would make it a “roof” for\nproduction that grows over time but is also affected by impacts).\n\nAlso, while\nit might be advantageous to have lower protection then max, and boost insurance\nhigher up, adding a “popular opinion” measurement that drops on damages and that\nkick you out would also mean more realism. There is a general trend towards not\naccepting risks in more developed societies (regardless of costs involved).",

The game in “real-time”,\nmade you take fast decisions in a horizon of time that will affect the\ndevelopment of the community and the way they face the imminent risk of a Comet.\nThe trade-off of investigating the comet, that will generate a systemic shock, or\ninvesting in the development of Alora was the main theme and the key decision.\nInvesting in research helps prevent further losses and take insurance, each one\ncost an amount of money, so that with each one of the comet impacts, the\ncommunity could coup with each one of the risk and expand even more. But as you\ninvest in counter measures, you have also to take into account that you need to\ndevelop the community.  The game made me\nconfront the trade-off affecting the way I took decisions constantly, in the\nway that you have to stop investing in development of the community to make\npreparations, taking insurance and research the comet so the impact doesn’t\ntake too much of the development I have to the moment. The game summaries and\nexplains the way that preparation affect both, immediately and in the future,\nthe development of the community. As you are more prepared, the events became “less”\ntragic and the development more steady. \n\nThe first\ntime I played, I focus more in developing the community than facing the risk of\nthe comet as the probability seems lower. The lack of research made me took for\ngranted the event of a comet impact, and didn’t take into account that extreme\nevents (with low probability) may occur and didn’t pass from the third level.\nThe second time, I took as one of the basic decisions, to buy insurance as it\nbecame more important to advance in the game, a good balance between investing\nin research and protection (including insurance) and investing in devolvement is\nthe key for getting further in the game and reaching the last levels (I reach the\nfifth). Managing the income gets, naturally, harder as you go forth so the decisions\nhave to be coherent from the beginning of the game so you don’t have it\ndifficult to develop the community in the highest levels.\n\nTo better\nrepresent the risk faced by the community, I would add an Idiosyncratic effect,\nso the impact doesn’t affect all equally but some more heavily than others.\nThis matter brings more realism to the game as each part of the community don’t\nface the same risk equally, and the cost furthermore be equivalent to the\nimpact. And as the community develops more, facing another risk not only comets\nbut other types of risk like population over growth and in a systemic way,\nfloods or frosts that destoy also the food. Facing other types of risk (more probable) will make the participants\nto face situations more common in the everyday life, like manage insurance in case of floods (Future contracts) that are the most common risk in tropical countries.",

            "reflection": "I have enjoyed playing the game so much. it was really fun and helped me understand the position and vision of the leaders who are entitled of taking decision regarding how to deploy risk management and  to what extend should they commit to it.With no protection and no clear knowledge of the type of the asteroids in terms of severity and a possibility of a hit, someone can not even hope to make it pass level One. just like in real live, although the preparation for a threat or a shock that might never come seems a waste of good money and time at the first place, it plays the major divider between wining and losing.Too much risk management is not the way you can do it either, If you geared all your resources toward that goal you will absolutely lose the development race also. so you basically need to find the magical balance that allow you to develop while securing your self against shocks.in the first time I forgot about insurance thinking i can totally relay on protection a thing proved me wrong with one quick moving high severity asteroid. thus in the following turns I have made more commitment to  the insurance. one other thing I was doing too much risk management while completely forget about development. So in the following turns I have payed a little more Concentration to the development part of the game  I didn't like the fact that the development bar just lag whenever you hit  the protection button, I would rather make it cost more money and make the money harder to obtain to make it more related to the real life. In my country risk management is costly and a lot of people feel an urgent need for other things to be done instead with the money. A concept that has been brilliantly inherited in the game to represent this very real life fact. however I would have pushed it a little more by making the insurance a little more expensive to obtain making it more challenging to get a good insurance plan that save you for another day when a shock take place. In a planet with only one type of shock to be feared of, it was relevantly simple to develop and implement risk management, however in real life it more challenging to see the size of the risk especially in developing countries.finally,  As English is not my first language please accept my deepest apologies for the grammar mistakes.  ",

In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The game aims to prepare the community to manage the potential shocks caused by the comets and the following waves. My priority is to build a minimum set of luminated blocks and upgrade them as high as possible, meanwhile increase the height of my island. Clearly protection is my priority. I did not focus much on research and insurance until I reached Level 4.I prepare for risk immediately. 2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I played the game twice. The first time I did not even pass Level 1, and the second time I reached the highest level. The main difference between the two times is at the second time, I focus more on upgrading the luminated blocks. I think it is critical to ensure the quality of the protection.  3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Provide more selections of protection. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game is to save life. build a city strong enough to resist to a natural disaster, comets.Firstly, my strategy was to prioritize most of my resources to build enough household (3-4) and start investing in the protection.Then, household produced enough resources to let me invest in insurance and knowledge. keep building more households and invest more in protection and knowledge.Because of the preparation for the risk, the development of the city has been slowed down.With this strategy my city grown up slowly but without fear. i get quickly enough resources to reinforce the facilities of the households and keep a strong protection. Protection that i was able to complete with the knowledge of the disaster and the time obtain to build more connectionif i were play the game again, i would invest more in insurance at the beginning. Less protection but a good coverage would help more to develop quickly the city, thus gain more resources. I noticed it was more useful and efficient  at mid-term. to get a good insurance coverage compare to build a strong protection immediately, The main things learned from this game are to prioritize the tasks in order to insure the well developing of the city. Oriented my strategy on a long term development. Better to go slowly for developing facilities but be sure everything is safe. If i were tasked with developing a new version of the game, i would have added the psychological dimension of the population. In other words, the behaviour approach of the human being. For example, more you invest your time to educate the population about the risk of disaster and their consequences, less the cost to protect the city will be expensive or faster you could build your protection. That can be a good to understand the importance of the public actors as government to make their population aware about the risk.The change i would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i am living would be to develop more regulation about the protection of food resources, particularly about the access to the clean water. Also develop the protection against the rising of the sea. I am living at the  border of the sea, lot of building and infrastructure has been build on the 70's without any consideration about this kind of risk.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was very important, in order to gain the\ngoal of building and developing the community. First of all was to get\ninformation of how long it would take to have enough money to buy the plots and\ninsurance. In my game was always important to have insurance and then obtain\ninformation of the comets to make efficient decisions related with giving more\nprotection for the village or invest in better plots. When I past the level 4 I\nrealized that insurance and giving more protection, gave me the opportunity to\ninvest faster than other level in better plots and houses, and also I chose a\nless expensive insurance. For me investing in protection was more effective for\ntaking care of lives of the community, so then we can grow in an organized way,\nand also do not have a bigger damage after a comet hit the community.I\nthink is important to get information of the village, the time and money you\nneed to get protection, the proper way to grow and with all this research make\nthe best decisions that benefits all the community. The priority was to develop a mitigation plan and\nuse in a wise way wealth and resources I have for the community. I could\nrealized that maybe do not focusing only in improve the shelters was the\npriority, and instead it was to invest in a better insurance or protection, and\nthen buy more plots. In my case, I prefer to buy fewer plots and increase the\ninvestment on them, and in the next level complete the plots and making them\ngrow. With this decision, I can have strongest plots and when disaster appears,\nthe plots can communicate better and damage is not that bigger.\n\nAbout the game, I think it was a good way to introduce ourselves to make\ndecisions and realized what trade-offs we are able to do in order to manage\nbetter a risk. It is not easy for policy makers to prepare a plan prioritizing\nnot only between one or two risk, they are more and the idea is to invest in\nthe best way our wealth to save more lives. For that, stronger protection is\nneeded and it is important that community stay connected and organized. Also,\nthat government always use information and invest in technologies and\ninsurance, because with it the can save more lives and spend less amount of\nmoney in it.  ",

            "reflection": "Reflecting on the game money and vision where key factors in the game and the advancement. Risk management was mostly centered on preventing the infrastructure from being ruined or halted from its development and dealing with the after effects of the meteors. When it came to money i was divided between construction of new buildings, improving old ones, buying insurance or some other means of risk prevention. Development was affected both in the long run and the short run, being limited to continuing on a project, fixing an old one, upgrading or starting again. Risk preparation was a limiter to continuing the project but also one that helped it continue after a meteor strike. The times I repeated the game, I built less buildings and focused mostly on research of the meteors, buying insurance and other measures to prevent a large impact on the project. Also the few buildings I made I continued to improve and upgrade them until I had enough money to build smaller and cheaper new ones. As for Risk Management in general it is a constant and never ending process, even after a project is finished. Being constantly ready to notice a possible event that will hinder the place where the project is moving forward. Not only that the stress this causes is considerable which also means that any risk manager must have a clear mind, iron will and sound judgement. It was interesting how the time researching took from the time to build and improve, even when some buildings where already finished. Which I think makes an important point on how to manage ones time when managing risk. The brings me to my second point, the tactics one chooses to create their risk management  strategy does not have to have a lot of elements in it, just a few right ones will do. Not only prioritizing resources but the measures that will prepare one for any event. If I would change the game in any way it would be in the different types of catastrophes that can affect the project, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, heavy rain ect. I would leave the same geographical location for constructing the infrastructure, also I would limit the amount of measures that can be taken after increasing the different things that can be done to prevent a catastrophe. I would expande the research tool to be used on varios factors in the game, in order to make decision making much more challenging and resource managing even  more so. Probably the thing that I would like to add but find difficult, would be human interaction as a form of risk management, like a lawsuit, an accident or shareholder disagreements. A bit complex but those are factors that arise when taking on a task, people as a a source of risk. Not to be negative but it is a real life dilema and learning how to deal with it is something that is not taught in most schools. This factor would make the game more complicated and would not make the player rely to much on the measures of probability and possibility. Relying only on numbers and equations is not enough for good risk management, they are important but relying only on them allows for tunneled vision of the environment one is in.",

            "reflection": "This game was created in order to see how right risk management could save the city. It was based on decision-making process where Courserians should consider knowledge of risk, protection and insurance. We also had to find some equilibrium or trade-off between these principles, maintain it among levels and tried to be prepared for potential disaster. If this strategy was strictly maintained, we could reach higher kevel of the game.Considering the influence of number of games played, I have to agree that every time I lost the game I tried not to do the same mistake in the next game. And I learned one thing: \"Do not be nervous about approaching asteroid but try to identify the threats, determine risk rising from that threat and find ways to reduce it.\"In my opinion, I find the game very well-designed in terms of acquiring basic knowledge about risk management. Maybe it would be more beneficial if there was more than one threat (fall of asteroid). The threat was differentiated just in the severity, not in variety. It would bring near the reality since we face a large number of threats every day.",

            "reflection": "            The game\nreally showed the impacts of knowing how to balance protection and growth when\none is handling risk management for a settlement such as the simulation within\nthe game. Without a good balance and knowing how much of each one needs to\nfocus and not tipping the scales, the city would not grow or get completely\ndestroyed before the city can truly reach its growth potential. There were\nseveral things I learned in the game about risk and development but the biggest\none was that one needs to know that growth sometimes needs to be put on a\nstandstill when the risk is too high for safety. Knowing that a comet was about\nto hit the city and create major collateral damage or when there is no\ninsurance at the moment creates a point of fear in myself and probably the\npeople of the settlement. Insurance in particular always took priority in the\nbeginning of every level as well as protection so one would know that the city\nis protected to a point where, if a comet were to hit the settlement, the city\nwould not be destroyed to a point where the funds will not come in time to fix\nall the damages. \n\n            The first\ntime around I did not realize how big of a deal research was in making sure the\ncity was safe. Research was more than just seeing when the comet was coming. It\nwould say what is a good level to have in terms of protection as well as\ncreates research levels to get outside help. Knowing when to get this research\nis a big deal also. I would not do it if I needed to build stuff or increase\nprotection but if I was waiting for more revenue to come in I would wait for\nmore research particularly with a comet I knew was going to be severe since\nwhen it did hit the settlement I had tons of help to increase the protection\nand keep the settlement safe. It really showed what a big deal international\naid does when preparing for a disaster. \n\n            Protection\nalso seemed to not be as big of a deal after a certain tipping point. Once at a\ncertain level, using the money for protection is more of a waste and can be\nused to grow the city. However, insurance was always a huge deal. Basically\nwhenever I did not do insurance at the very beginning and even waiting for\nenough money to come in to buy the insurance before growing the city, the city\nwould be destroyed to a point of no return. It really shows the power of having\na good insurance plan for cities and for life in general. \n\n            If I were\nto change the game, I would probably add permanent protection in the game such\nas walls that one would built rather than raising the land. The walls could be\ndamaged and protection seemed kind of a nuisance in the game rather than in\nreality where they would be built from the ground up such as in New Orleans and\nwould be built higher and higher as the water was more likely to hit. \n\n",

            "reflection": "  We were tasked to play a game which had an objective of risk management.  I was expected to determine where to allocate funds in order to develop the \"country.\"  The risks presented were comets coming at the country.  I chose most often to protect the country and insure it against natural disaster.  By doing this, I was unable to develop the country to it's capacity.  I made fewer pods and did not develop the pods to a higher level.  I did, however, protect the country from a great deal of damage from comets.  Initially, protecting against losses was easier because developing a small country took less resources.  After a while, however, it became more difficult to protect the country while maintaining a steady development due to the increased resources development was taking.  I played the game a couple of times to try to better understand the concepts and functions.  If I were to play it again, I would develop more of my country as it got bigger instead of putting my resources towards protection.  I did find it most valuable to have the country insured against the comets.  The first time I played I did not protect enough at the beginning, which I am starting to believe is where it is most beneficial to develop your protection.  I mostly learned that there is a balance to be achieved between development, insurance, and protection when managing a country.  If you put too many of your resources into one of those three areas, you will not be able to survive a natural disaster.  I also learned that it was impossible to predict when natural disaster might occur, and sometimes you can be over-prepared and lose an opportunity to develop the country.  If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would change one simple thing.  I would allow for more opportunity to research the comets.  By having greater opportunity for research, I could better determine where my resources are needed.  At times during the game I over-insured or over-protected, simply because I did not know enough about the comet and what risks it presented.  In order for the game to better reflect where I live, I would change the comets to tornadoes and the pods into neighborhoods.  Protection would look different due to the different dynamics a tornado presents, but the insurance and development would be quite similar.",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon game has been a learning experience in terms of\nthe management of multiple resources to develop a community, meeting milestones\non the way by managing shocks, to the best of the ability of the ‘Luminator’. The\ngame involved risk management lessons as there was a need to build capacity to prepare\nfor the impending shocks so that they can be tackled in an efficient\nmanner.  The various interlinked factors\nof risk management were effectively represented in the game, which gave a real\nlife experience. I confronted trade-offs to development, as represented by development\nbar, in the form of resources- both time and money, which had to be spent on\nresearch, protection and insurance instead developing new pods or upgrading old\nones. Constrained by both time and money, the rate of development of pods was\nslowed due to diversification of these resources to prepare for shocks. The benefits\nof being well prepared did exceed costs though, the right amount of research,\ninsurance and protection- all helped in coping with shocks in a very efficient\nmanner. \n\nFrankly, it took me a couple of attempts to understand the\ngame and to design a strategy involving decisions on the major trade-offs I\nfaced. The risk management lessons and examples I learnt from the video\nlectures came to use as I identified various provisions in the game to factors\nlike knowledge, protection and insurance. My behaviour towards these provisions\nalso changed, as I understood their role in developing the community by\nmanaging imminent shocks. I was able to manage all the different provisions in\na smarter manner, which helped me reach the development milestones within the\ntime which was provided. Like any role playing game, Risk Horizon also involved\nmanaging multiple features, with each action having consequences and no provision\nof going back. A couple of times I even paused the game to decide my next step\nby looking at the level of severity and probability of a comet attack. \n\nThe game has been successful in capturing various aspects of\nrisk management. Simplifying the game meant giving up a little on how realistic\nit is. Being from a rural background of a developing nation, with a fair\nunderstanding of economics and finance, I would try to add features\nrepresenting risk and factors required to mitigate it in a village setting, for\na group of farmers. This would involve access to land, labour, credit and\ninsurance markets-the risk and returns from each of these factors. In the\npresent game, the returns from a protective measure in not visible with a\nquantifiable variable being absent. I would like to incorporate such variables\nto understand returns with respect to the risk involved in making a choice.",

            "reflection": "The risk management played a crucial role in the game by helping one \ntake adequate step towards protecting the pods from falling comets. It \nprovided information which enabled game players take adequate measures \nwhere necessary. Information such as severity, chances of impact were \nvery important in taking a decision whether to purchase insurance or \nraise the platform by clicking the button on the bottom left side of the\n game window. During the game two things played important role in my\n choice of protection and insurance, they are information gotten from \nknowledge about comets in terms severity, chances of impact and \nknowledge. Protection of my pods was of topmost priority. At every \nchance, I was always seeking to elevate my platform so that impact from \nthe comets will be minimized on the pods. As I did this, I noticed I had\n a greater chance of surviving and succeeding to the next level of the \ngame.Preparing for risk took some time to pay off. As the moment the\n game begins I started preparing against  possible risk posed by falling\n comets. This was helpful in keeping my pod alive later during the game.Ans to Question 2I\n played the game more than ones. At first, I was just interested in \nbuying new pod and getting as many as I can buy, sometimes obtaining up \nto four before loosing the game. But in subsequent plays I stopped \nbuying more pod and restricted myself to protecting the one, two or \nthree I already have. This helped me stay alive in the course of the \ngame. A take home lesson from the game is \"to be successful one most\n take risk knowledgeably and also take measures in protecting self \nagainst future risks\". Ans to Question 3 I will reduce the \nnumbers of time a pod need to be shielded from the impact of the comet \nfrom 10 to 4 or from 5 to 2. Ones I have assurance that my pod is \ncompletely shielded from impacting comet I will take more steps \ntowards buying more. I will also make it faster to lift the platform in \norder to reduce impact from comet. I notice that the existing game takes some reasonable amount of time to be able to raise the earth platform.Finally I would include a faster option for shielding pod even if it is at a higher cost. This will be of tremendous help.",

            "reflection": "Role of Risk Management- Intend optimize allocation and use of our limited resources (knowledge, protection and insurance) as means to impulse a time - sustained development for this reign within a uncertainty context. - It´s a decision game. Always you must make a decision, an option and seek a rational equilibrium between different composite of resources after an informal cost - benefit analysis. Learning from the gameAt the beginning, I relied on my capabilities and knowledge but failed. After several attempts, my knowledge grew, but if you don´t make use of it, then return again to level 1. Then I began to study intensely the comets, its data (severity of impact, likelihood of impact) and the impact to insurance cost. Additionally, I taught  to manage scarce money and try assign it rationally between buying insurance policy and/or getting up the protection.  Time and money resources and its management represent a key issue. Meanwhile time going on, I must thinking not under a inmediate shock but future perspective. We need doing some kind of investment (protection, etc). No matter the first comet. Whichever next are important, too. I observed that the first levels (1,2 and 3 indeed), factor protection is necessary and less insurance. If we´ll get advanced up game, the relative position compared protection is more reasonable. Without forgetting, the more knowledge, less insurance is necessary. As insurance as protection, both are not cheap. Up level, cost gets up. In theory, the more research, more relations and links with other communities. So, it´s useful when you need to repair your houses. But, if you overdo in any resource, just then, the meter gets into red and the development is getting down again. Resilience down??  If anyone promote the development in a quickly mood or style, failure will come, because it needs to be more assured and if your insurance coverage is limited, again bad situation. We don´t know the next shot, its potential danger. So, we are to protect us. But if you protect too much for tiny potential damage, money will fall down for constructing more development. It´s key to discover the balance between resources. From level 3 or 4 to take more consideration to insurance resource, I think it´s important because we must support, defend what we´ve already got it. Of course it´s unthinkable if we haven´t handle appropiately protection and knowledge before.So, one fact I also taught was to upgrade the community, securing it but gradually, stepping. If the research is fruitful, then severity downgrade. This matter helps us to waste too much money in protection adequating it. So I arrived until level 5, but never didn´t overpass it. Perhaps, I didn´t know how re-balance my resources structure, specially the role of money stock and to re-gain more time, achieve a good resilience position.Many times, we ourselves let us falling into self -confidence and the past may be not repeated again in the future. New level, distinct comets and its hit specifications. Bad cost - benefit analysis very likely and wrong decisión. In spite of rolling in money, I suppose if it is not employed wisefully, meter paints in red. Perseverance and CopingChanges A potential improvement will be introduce estimated loss in each comet or potential shock, linking impact to cost. So, you can manage even better your assignment of resources.Other change will be to clarify a bit more the roIe of money and how you see the Coping.Having in level 5 1000 $, good insurance coverage and respetable level of protection with a good community development, no useful to overpass it.",

            "reflection": "Pertaining to risk management as embodied in the risk horizon game,\nhereunder are my observations. Firstly, risk management involves\ntradeoffs. While  protection enhances the capacity to mitigate the impact\nof future disasters (elevating the island tantamount to creating  wealth),\n it also has its  downside\nwhich is   reflected in having less time to spin the comet off its destructive\nsea-bound path. It also means that the higher one elevates the island, the more\nexpensive insurance becomes (reflected in the cost of any repairing the damaged\npods). This is because at lower level of the island insurance costs less than\nwhen the island is elevated.  That said, early preparations and\nprotection  allow the player time to acquire knowledge through research\n(more time to focus on spinning the comet up the sky). What I also found out\nduring my second attempt was that If I bought sufficient insurance and raised\nthe island to a certain height, it took sometime before comets emerged, which\nmeant that I had more time to develop the island. \n\nI played the game twice, and for sure I found it scintillating but\nchallenging all the same. This is because the game gives the player a glimpse\nat what it takes to tackle risk. While protection as manifested in elevating  the island enhances the capacity to mitigate\nloss in the event of  future disasters,  protection by itself is insufficient to do\naway with loss entirely without buying  insurance  protection that reduces the  cost of damages, albeit mitigated. In other\nwords,  eradicating the destruction from\nfuture  disasters is not possible let\nalone feasible,  rather risk management\nshould be done through proactive measures  (preparations knowledge acquisition, protection\nand buying insurance).  I noticed that\nthe interface changed during my second attempt. During my first attempt, as far\nas I can recall, the message on how much I gained by protecting the\nisland(elevating it), was a lump sum  figure as was the amount of money I\nspent during my repairs and research work. However, during my second messages\npertaining to those aforementioned issues popped up as I engaged in the\nactivity.\n\nThe first time I played the game, I got so messed up that I almost gave up.\nHowever, with time I realized I had to develop some strategies right from the\noutset.  I realized that raising the island, provides the player with\nresources  and saves on the insurance premiums initially, allows more time\nto undertake  development, acquisition of\nknowledge, that bolsters preservation and social capital harnessing\n(relationships). However, overtime Insurance cost rises, with the implication\nthat cost of damages soars substantially. One takeaway: not to deprive vital\nresources for future development , investment  in  protection\nand insurance should be early and at just sufficient level. Moreover, insurance\nshould be bought early before premiums surge once a disaster strikes, saving\nample time to acquire research knowledge that hastens development\ncapabilities.\n\nWhat I would add, or enhance is the feature that shows underscores the\nimportance of  collective effort (social\ncapital) in preparing  for disasters, mitigating\nsuffering or losses in the wake of disasters, and recovery from disasters.\nSocial capital increases societal  awareness of the potential loss from future\ndisasters, fosters capacity building through information creation, updating and\nsharing on potential disaster  cost,  possible ways to protect individual\nlivelihoods (solidarity), reduces the burden of  rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. Adding\na feature that highlights the importance of bridging and linking social capital\ncan make the game more realistic.  It\ncould also be better if a feature that underscored the importance of learning\n(acquired knowledge is not easily lost but becomes an asset is bequeathed to\nfuture generations.  \n\n",

            "reflection": "1) The role of risk management in the game was to use knowledge (research) protection and insurance to protect the development (building and upgrading pods) take into consideration resources (time and money). I made a lot of choices from balance among risk management tools (using them with the same priority), choose not to buy insurance and increase my protection, choose to sacrifice the development or to stop the development using money to increase risk management by buying knowledge or increase protection or buy best insurance to take risk of shock missing. Each strategy in the game has a cost so sometime you can buy insurance and at the end you do not use it or increase unnecessary your protection or build pods but with weak risk management and at the end the shock will come and destroy them.  The preparation for the risk affect the development at any stage and especially in the medium term( after some time). 2) I played the game more than once, for the first time I did not have good knowledge about the development (update of pods) and research. I was wasting too much time in research). The second time I reduced the time allocated for research and increase a bit my wealth. At the end, some time when my insurance is unused I stopped increasing my protection at the level required by the severity of the shock, so in the case where the is a shock I can use my insurance.3)  I think that we can improve the game by making it more realistic. My suggestion is that we can first  distinguish the type of shock such as drought, flood, job, etc. second develop a combination of different risk management strategies that fit well with the shock ( in which the player will have to provide his choice depending on the shock) then after that we can introduce the severity of the shock so that the player can use his wisdom to determine the type of insurance to buy, the level of production and the type of pod to develop ( the type of pod now can be related to the type of predominant or regular shock). We can also add the coping measure as well.Thank you",

            "reflection": "Risk\nmanagement skills were key to succeed in this game. Both the game’s name and\nfeatures were explicit indicators of that specificity. Concretely, you had to\nprevent as well cope with the consequences of a natural disaster, namely the\ncrashing of meteorites, while building and developing a sustainable community.\nFor that purpose, you had to compose with protection, effective building,\ndifferent insurance bundles, and research.\n\nI had to\nconfront constant trade-offs between all those components as privileging only\none of them, whichever it was, led to a deadend. After some time, preparation\nfor risk induced less damage from meteorite crashings and more rapid additional\noverall preparation degree.\n\nI played\nthe game many times. I especially learnt how to adapt the research level for each\nmeteorite in regard to its potential impact, and to focus good enough on\ncommunity development as an asset in itself. I also learnt that the maximal\ndegree of insurance taken from the beginning was not a valid option as it cost\nmoney that was essential to a sufficient level of community building at the start in order to pass the levels.\n\n\nWhat I\nespecially learnt: how to adapt systematic research to coming potential\ndisasters and adapt it both to its potential level of impact and its actual\nchance of occurring, without neglecting that research can take time that is\nhard to evaluate, and that it protects most of the time, yet not every time. I\nhad to remember how important community building AND community development are\nkey. I also had to consider this last double aspect as a partial efficient substitute\nfor individual insurance. Last, I had to consider how lessons from the past are\nessential yet do not immunize against new coming disasters by themselves, as\nadditional research and circumstantial adaptation are necessary as well and all need time, energy, and a lot of attention. I first disliked then liked the game.\n\nI live in\nFrance. I think a positive improvement of the game could lie in a more detailed\nemphasis on the necessity of building communities, as we are a society\nindividualized to a high degree in my country. For example, in the case of job unemployment, which\nstays among causes of disaster exposed in the course, the loneliness of the\njobless is impacting very dramatically their health, their perspectives of\ngetting a job again, and their economic and family situation. Thus, there could\nbe two components instead of only one to represent community building in the\ngame, the additional element being explicitly linked to human interconnections\nand interactions, through daily communication, learning, freely each-other-assisting.",

There were times when no matter the preparation, I was\noften decimated by severe impacts. It has taught me an important lesson beyond\nprepare for the worst and hope for the best. I has taught me to anticipate\npotential disasters and to prioritize projects. \n\n \n\nWhen I began my colony in Risk Management, I built three pods immediately\nand purchased Tier 1 insurance in case of damages. I continued expanding until\nI colonized all of the available land. \n\n \n\nI continued upgrading my structures one at a time. I was half way through\nthe upgrade of my third tower when a meteor struck damaging most of my\nstructures. The insurance helped reduce the time and cost of repairs. \n\n \n\nI raised the elevation two bars. This did cause a delay in my progress. I\nissued repairs and upgrades. A medium severity meteor crashed, causing\nfifty-percent damage to colony. This was a devastating blow as I raced against\nthe clock. I issued more repairs and watched yet another medium severity meteor\nstrike. I went from nearly reaching my goal to falling to half way. Fearing for\nthe loss of my colony, I chose not to elevate the plateau to avoid delaying the\nreconstruction efforts. I managed to upgrade all of my structures to tier four\nand purchased additional insurance to help protect my investments. \n\n \n\nOnly a third of my pods had fully recovered from the last wave. As the\nclocked ticked closer and closer to the end of the round, I saw that my chances\nof survival were slimming. Much to my dismay, I saw three meteors in the sky. I\nclicked on them for research. Every single one had an eighty percent chance to\nhit with approximately a ninety-five percent severity. I knew right then and\nthere I would not make it. Ultimately, my colony was lost.\n\n \n\nI was frustrated; I felt that I was dealt a very bad hand. In that moment,\nhowever, I realized that this was what happened in the real world. All too\nfrequently, natural disasters all too frequently have little early warning. Preparation,\ninsurance, elevation, all of it can easily be washed away by a series of\nunfortunate turn of events. \n\n \n\nI tried again. My second attempt, I first began by raising the elevation by\nfour bars. I felt this to be the safest way to begin as I was far above the sea\nlevel. My expectation was that this would reduce the overall potential damage\nshould a meteor strike. Immediately afterward, I set out constructing more pods.\nI upgraded pods as quickly as funds became available. After each pod upgraded, I\ncontinued elevating the plateau higher. I finished constructing all of my pods\nand fully half of them were tier two.  I\ndid not purchase insurance beyond Tier 1 as many meteors missed my colony\nbecause I felt my colony was sufficiently high above the water level.\n\n \n\nI was constantly checking the status of meteors. I would only raise the\nelevation for impacts with a high chance to hit. I managed to survive the first\nthrough rounds without trouble. Naturally, as I progressed, more and more\nmeteors continued to assault my colony. The first impact affected approximately\nten percent of my structures. I was able to recover from that.\n\n \n\nA very severe\nasteroid struck that demolished my colony with close to seventy percent damage.\nOnce again, I knew I was out of the match. I saw my progress bar plunge to the\nbottom and waited for the time to run out. \n\n",

            "reflection": "I played the game many times not making\nit pass level 3. I tried many different strategies from\nbuilding all pods in level 1 to having minimum pods with high\nupgrades in level 1 (fancy structures and trees). Knowledge added\nmore wealth than protection. Insurance was necessary; I did not make\nit pass a level without insurance. I always purchased the highest\ninsurance plan. I quickly noticed there was a balance between adding\nupgrades and increasing protection. It was pointless to have high\nprotection without upgrades or visa versa. Upgrades were costly to\nrepair, sometimes my wealth was insufficient to cover the repair\ncost. So, I had to increase my wealth through knowledge before the\nnext comet collision.  Rebuilding required time. I had to constantly check my wealth making sure I can maintain the existing pods (with upgrades) before I could build new pods.  Knowledge was\ncorrelated to the time you had to develop the community connection (the flashing lights).\nThe community connection patterns I did not understand; I assume it\nwas random. At the end, it determine the severity of the impact. The\nseverity effected the development meter. How quickly it turned from\ngreen to red!!! Do have have sufficient wealth to cover the all the repairs at once or do have to repair over time.  \n\n\nThe take home message: A balance exist\nbetween knowledge, insurance and protection. At the beginning it is\ndifficult to establish the balance. In the beginning you may have\nmore access to knowledge than protection. Knowledge tells you what\ntype of protection your need. Eventually, there will be a need for\ninsurance.  In reality, there is no set order in what comes first\nknowledge, insurance or protection; all are required. In some ways\nknowledge, protection and insurance are depended on each other,\nwithout one they other two are useless. Over time, balance will be\nachieved between the three. When knowledge is increased, protection\nand insurace most increase also, but not at the same rate. It is\ninterested how wealth plays into the risk management equation. In the\ngame knowledge and protection added wealth to community, but reality\nknowledge (acquiring/research) and protection (providing) can reduce\na community wealth.  Only in the longterm does protection and\nknowledge become cost effective. Community wealth is difficult to\nmanage and balance, always having sufficient funds to cover daily\ncost (without risk), yet have surplus money to cover the repairs from\na natural disaster, disease or food/water shortage.  Community wealth\nis key piece in risk management. Communities having financial\ninvestors and/or access to markets, will help people survive all\ntypes of events from covering basic daily cost to severities cause by\nnatural disasters. Wealth also helps coping with a disaster and preparing for future shocks.\n\nNew game version: Buildings located\nfarther from the cliff (shore edge) should have different pricing for\nrepairs and cost for building. Geographical location influences building and repair prices for protection and insurance. Add more ways to increase wealth for example access to an investor or a market,besides knowledge or protection, to have more\nmoney for repairs and building. It is difficult repair or build without wealth. \n\n",

            "reflection": "Gamecode: bAG7rZ8Risk management is all about\ncollecting information, as was in the game. Once you are sure about the\npossible damage you can expect, you’ll be able to use your resources wisely, to\nmatch the possible outcome and minimize losses. You start to go further in the\ngame when you realize that focusing in research to find out the chance of hit and possible damage is way cheaper than expend all your money on a ultra-hi-tech not needed security and insurance. \n\nIt’s important to match your defensive\nsystem to the size of the threat you'll face; building the “best defensive system\never made” may be way worse than a very simple that matches the specific\nneed. Why would you build a 3 meter wall if you only wants to stop your neighbor dog from enter your yard and eat your journal? You will be expending\nmoney and time on something that could be solved by just talking to your neighbor about the\nproblem, or just building a wood fence, or buying a mailbox. The important\npoint is to match your needs, save precious resources, and apply them on other\nthings that are really important.\n\n            To do this, you'll need\nInformation, and information is key on risk management. Accurate, reliable, updated\ninformation. Bad information can be many times worse than no information at all.\nKnowing you don’t know something will make you search for it or adopt a secure\nroute, just to be sure. Having bad information will make you believe that what you\nare doing is the right thing. You might end expending a lot more money and time\non something that might never be used or even worse, when it actually happen,\nit will not work and people will be confident that they are safe, when\nthey are not.\n\n            Last year, on\nBrazil, a fire in a nightclub killed more than 240 people that thought where\nsafe, but when the crisis striked all systems failed and they are dead now. When\nyou go to a place you think you are safe, because at least in theory, you\nshould be, or the place shouldn’t be open. That’s just one example of how bad information can endanger\npeople.\n\n            The outcome of having reliable, useful\nand updated information is to have the certainty of how much money you need to\nexpend and how much money you can save for investments or others purposes. When\nthe subject is money is all about finding the right amount to do what you need,\nno more, no less. Expending just the right amount will allow you to use that\nentire amount that would be expended unnecessarily, on useful things.\n\n            It will happen, in certain\nsituations, where you just don’t have the money or for some reason the expense\nis so high to prevent the situation that it will be cheaper to let it happen –\nif it happen – and fix the damage afterwards. For those situations there are insurance, you pay for it, and when the crisis strikes you are protected, at\nleast financially. Having insurance allows people to take more risks, because\nthey feel safe, the same way of having any other system that guarantee they\nwill make it through.\n\n            All of three have their own role and\nare important to outcome adversity when it happens. It is up for the risk\nmanager to make the balance between them and chose the right one on each\nsituation. But undoubtedly information is the first thing to be taken in\nconsideration, reliable, accurate and updated information, to guide everyone on\nthe right way.Guilherme Thomas",

            "reflection": "First of all, this game is really great to know how research, preparation and insurance are important.　Thanks for giving this opportunity.Related to 1. -This game requires the development of our community in Alora land. But some comets attack the land and destroy our facilities so that we have to prevent from those disasters. There is cost constrain between the development and the preparation. We have to consider the balance how to spend our money to develop our community with lowest damage from comets. -I confronted which I should spend first. e.g. If I develop our community first, I could not buy a good insurance due to lack of money. If I spend a lot of money for preparation, the speed of development will be slow. Timing was also very important.-At first, I tried to buy good insurance before start developing our community as I know comets attack several times with high possibility. Next, I researched to analyze how dangerous the comets coming to the land.When comets came close to the land, I tried to raise the height of the land.I could not avoid any damage completely but my insurance covered the recovery cost minimum.      Related to 2.-If I try once, I will be more cautious to avoid any damage but if I could try several times, I will repeat trial and error to look for the best scenario to achieve building ideal community. This is the game to learn risk so that I thought prevention was important but I have learned that too much preparation would not be best way. The balance of developing and cost is important. At the same time, the timing of preparation is also important.Related to 3.-If I am tasked with developing new version, I will make several kinds of risk from small fires to big earthquakes with possibilities. Depends on the risks and possibilities, our way of preparation will change. - I live in Japan. In March 11th, 2011, we had an experience of big earthquake and big tsunami. Japan has been experiencing big earth quakes several times so that the damage from the earthquake was very limited despite of huge magnitude. But many people died due to big tsunami and Fukushima daiichi nuclear plants were destroyed. Big tsunami was not unprecedented event. There were several big tsunami attacked those regions every 60 to 70 years. You can find some makers warned about big tsunami attacked there made by those people who had experienced long time ago. The scale of risk and the possibility of risk are two main factors to evaluate how to deal with. How to prepare from the rare events would occur every 60 to 70 years but the scale of damage is huge if once occur should be kept thinking.  　     ",

Risk\nManagement is also described as 'all the things you need to do to make the\nfuture sufficiently certain'.\n\nIn context of the\ngame,game shows the point by point relation between various institutions  in reference to a disaster of falling comets\nfrom sky of varying hitting probability and severity  . \n\nThe role of risk\nmanagement in the game was to successfully balance the four main key elements\nnamely Protection,insurance,research and the most important one development\n growth which included setting up of pods(like industsries of a country)\nand upgrading them from time to time. \nProtection level indicators included how high our island was from the\nground and the number of luminated blocks of in the meter. Research methods was\nby hovering the pointer over the falling comets and gaining knowledge about\nthem whereas research which was the most effective tool in risk management\nhelped counter the losses in the game,and alongwith reaching to the critical\nlevel of required development in the given timeframe.\n\nChoices and\ntrad-offs included taking risk after getting insured. In the whole game ,the\nincome or the cash in hand is the most affective factor towards  decision of choosing in between 4 elements of\nrisk management i.e. which one to empowered the most. The most effective method\nfound was to get insured and get going with the process of development with\nbalanced investment on research and protection. I found the insurance and  development the most effective then\nprotection and then research.Although giving less attention on protection and research\nis not a good idea but at the same time winning the game was the ultimate goal\nso we have to make tough choices.\n\n \n\nPreparation for\nrisk affects development in ways that it helps the community to resist the\nshocks well,and if at all any losses are caused coping them at minimum cost(via\ninsurance) and the given timeframe so as to bring back the pods in there\noriginal condition. In the initial\nphase investing more on one pod rather than setting up new pods was a  mistake that needs to be corrected while playing\nthe game again since it takes more time and cash to upgrade the system rather\nthen setting up new systems and getting started to generate revenues from\ninvestment. And the  most important\ncorrection is to take insurance plan as soon as possible, because once hit by a\nsevere comet it becomes almost impossible to do a come back in game if you don’t\nhave insurance.   If there arises a\nneed to create a new version of the game :the most annoying  thing i found upgrading research ,why there is\na need to stop ourselves while doing research upgradation.In the new version i\nwould be introducing a cash flow button for research i.e. when to allow cash\nflow  in research and when not to.  ",

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk management was decide when/how much to develop with the threat of the comets and the consequences of the comments. In terms of choices, I decided to research the level of severity and to then build up adequate protection. I would only purchase insurance if there were a large amount of high-severity comets in the horizon. Preparing for risk certainly impeded development. If the comets were particularly severe, it did not make sense to further develop some pods or even create others, as the amount of protection/resources needed would out-weight the benefits of development. This however, impacted the development goal, which lead to its ultimate failure. It demonstrated that even though you may have all of the tools, knowledge, and resources available, it cannot always lead to success if the threat is too large and varied. 2. I played the game more than once and I kept making mistakes (although different ones) at critical points. When building up too much protection, I may have had money, but I still failed to reach the development goal. When developing at a faster rate, I sustained more and more expensive damages. If I spent too much time on research, I was spending enough time on protection or development. While it was easier to succeed in the early levels, it was much harder to maintain a good balance of protection, research, and development in the later levels. If I played it again, I think I would try different balances of those three aspects. In a way, this is an interesting way to experiment, as you would not have this ability in the real world. There is no 'restart' when discussing real people, disasters, and communities, which demonstrates the high-level stakes those involved with international development deal with on a daily basis. 3. I would propose an \"ask for help\" button. This would mean that a certain amount of money (there could be degrees, such as with the insurance) would be go to an outside group. In return you could choose for 'outside research', 'outside development', or 'outside protection'. However, you do not get a say in how it is applied. Thus, the 'outside development' could develop pods further or it would just create new pods. 'Outside research' would either perform long research on one comet or short research on several comets, and 'outside protection', would raise to be just enough protection or too much. These would have an effect on your continued actions in the game. I think this would reflect how outside help can sometimes work in real life situations. The places that need research/development/protection cannot always do it themselves and have to hire others, but as a result, they do not always get to decided how it will be done, whether it is for the better or worse. In each case, it would be a gamble if it would help you progress to the next level or not, which is how it is in real life. ",

            "reflection": "What\nwas the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what\ntrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?\nIn what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after\nsome time)?\n\nThe\nrole of risk management seemed to be applying a trade-off of knowledge,\nprotection and insurance. The relationship between the three was ambiguous.\nInsurance was the easiest tool to apply and seemed to be worth hit given the\nfrequency of comets and the damage they caused. The fact that insurance lapsed\nautomatically when the level changed was a problem and had to be found out by trial\nand error. It was also a problem that I could not upgrade my insurance during a\nlevel once I had more funds.\n\nTo\ngain knowledge I tried to build large numbers of level one pods but only got to\nlevel 2. Then I tried building a few pods and put them up to higher levels.\nThis did not get me past level 2 either.\n\nI\ndid not understand the protection tool at all. Sometimes it seemed to help get\nthe land higher but at others it did nothing. There was no feedback as to why.\n\nPreparing\nfor risk affected development. If there was a comet in the sky a decision had\nto be made to upgrade now or wait to see what it would do first. I took the\npath that it is better to get on with things than wait around. This may have\nbeen a factor as to why I did not get past level 2.\n\nIf you played the game only\nonce, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?\nAlternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do\ndifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from\nthe game?\n\nI\nplayed the game three times before I got bored and frustrated with the appalling\nmusic. I varied the amount of pods I had and varied the speed in which I\nupgraded them. In one game I had one pod up to high levels while in another I\nhad lots of pods at low levels and in another I had a few pods at mid-levels of\ndevelopment. None of these option got me past level 2.The game captures, in a\nsimplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with\ndeveloping a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one\nsimple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management\nchoices that matter in the place you live?\n\nI live in Hong Kong which\nis a wealthy city with lots of risk management practices and infrastructure in\nplace. We are most at risk from flooding from heavy tropical storms and\ntyphoons. The drainage system is well built and maintained and there is a\nconstant reminder to citizens not to block them with rubbish and waste.\nDrainage not only keeps the low levels of the city (and its underground railway\nsystem) dry, it also minimises the danger of high flow water coming down from\nthe sheer mountains that the city is built around.\n\nHong\nKong is at risk from rising sea levels. Hong Kong island and Kowloon are\nprotected in a large part by sea walls. But if the sea levels above the levels\nof the storm water drainage this water will not be able to flow into the harbor\nduring storms and this will cause flooding. I am unsure what to recommend to\nmitigate this risk other than to advocate all the options of CO2 reduction that\nwill reduce the melting of the polar icecaps.",

            "reflection": "1. The role of the game was the development of the community of pods, and making choices with limited resources of how to defend the pods from the danger of crashing comets. It was difficult at first to recognize what defenses worked best against different types of comets with different risks of impact. In particular, I believe that I spent too much of my resources purchasing insurance, and not enough time doing research on the comets. When I adjusted my strategy later in the game, my results were better.2. I spent a lot more time doing research the second time I played. I didn't realize at first the impact that it had on mitigating the effects of the comets.3. I would add the opportunity to add other mitigation features to individual pods that have more importance, and that require bigger investments. So for example, it might be possible to completely insure a level 4 pod, or perhaps build a specific fence or mitigation feature for that pod.",

            "reflection": "From the start I have to say that english is not my first language, sorry about any mistakes you may find.1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The very important thing in the game is the decision making. You should evaluate what are the best decisions you could take to get to development in the planet and win the level each time. I found risk management and the economic concept of “opportunity cost” very seemed. The opportunity cost is what you are willing to lose when taking a decision. For example, if a very strong meteor is coming and it’s very likely that it will hit my pods, I would prefer purchasing insurance or protecting my pods by raising them than upgrading them or creating new ones, because what I could lose is much bigger than what I could gain upgrading or creating some pods. So, using the knowledge (information) you have and the resources you can afford, you can evaluate what will be the best decision, this is the principal key in the game and I think that’s what risk management is about. I faced many situations in the game where I had to protect or purchase insurance when a very strong meteor was just about to hit my planet, but it was worth it because what I would have lost if I didn’t do that would have been much bigger than what I would gain if I would’ve upgraded my pods. I used to get a lot of protection even if there were no meteors because it was very likely and almost inevitable that at any moment a destructive meteor could hit my planet, so, that affected development after some time, but when I upgraded or created new pods I noticed that my wealth increased a lot faster, so that would affect development immediately.2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I played it many times. The first time care about protection or insurance and didn't care too much about research and evaluate the impacts of meteors, losing a lot of resources and loss development . Obviously that wasn't a good decision. Them I adapt to every circumstances an create strategy's to achieve win the game. 3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I will suggest the possibility of anothers form of insurance will be fun in the making of strategys. Other thing that I really change for better is more information about wealth generator of pots and upgrades of insurance, research's.",

            "reflection": "While I found the game quite interesting and addictive, I didn't see quite as much risk management in it as I had expected. I expected more focus to be placed on issues such as insurance and mitigation. That being said, however, after having played the game several times, I realized that the focus should be on development, while keeping research and protection under control. During my first few games, i mainly focused on risk prevention, rather than on developing the buildings and doing research. During the last, winning, game, i focused more on development, while also ensuring that I am protected enough against possible risks. For instance, during this last game, I never even had to buy insurance. I simply did not need it, since my buildings were all at the latest development stage, with ground was high enough not to be damaged by the meteorite impact, and my research gave me pretty accurate information on what was to come. So, preparation for risk did affect development when i focused mainly on risk prevention. However, once I have found a balance between development and mitigation, I had no problem keeping everything in check. The lesson I can find in all this is that development cannot do without risk management and vice versa. If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would bring two changes to the game. First, I would add some other potential risks - thus making the players have to decide which hazards should take precedence and thus learning that most threats usually do not come alone. Secondly, I would like to enhance the community communication aspect of the game. I believe that pre, during and post communication is vital to proper risk management. ",

            "reflection": "The role of the risk management in the game was to build up sustainable village community. The houses had to be upgraded in order to reach higher profit, but at the same time the island had to be protected against natural disasters. I tried to evaluate the risk of each comet by reaching minimal research level. If the possibility of damage was low, I invested my resources into upgrading  houses or building new ones. It does take some time, so until new resources were generated, I came back to research of the comet, in order to gain time for making connections (this seems to be the easiest way of protection, since it doesn`t cost any resources. If the the probability of damage was high, I spend the resources on insurance and raising the island. In that case, the preparation for the risk was delaying the development.When I played the game the first time, I didn`t pay much attention into research. I build up massive protection, but then the resources were missing elsewhere and the growth of the village decreased. The second mistake I made, was investing too much money to upgrade the houses, but I was not building new ones.Then their maintenance become costly after catastrophe, and it took a long time to \"regenerate\" from the economical point of view. The main thing I learned from the game would be the necessity of balance. It is impossible to focus on one or two aspects, but the development has to approached in complex way.If I should change something in the game, I would add a measurement of the income speed of houses. Like this it is difficult to evaluate and compare the options for building new houses or developing existing ones.  ",

            "reflection": "The performance of the writer in the game illustrates some of the perils of risk management. A reasonable assessment of the failure to pass round 4 can be ascribed to excessive use of risk management techniques. The costs of risk management for the writer have exceeded the benefits gained from these techniques and drained precious resources, which could, therefore, not be accumulated fast enough to pass round 4. \n\nThe writer used both preventive measure and risk transfer measures to offset comet risk, investing heavily into raising the level of the pod village and purchasing, initially, level 1 insurance, which was eventually upgraded to level 2 insurance. The excessive risk prevention and mitigation (transfer) costs have drained cashflow from the pod village and resulted in a loss during level 4 of the game, as the costs of risk management, which had decreasing marginal returns per dollar spent, exceeded the returns and thus resulted in missed investment opportunities (the opportunity cost of investing into risk management was decreased/slower investment into building/improving/upgrading the village. \n\nThe lesson learnt for the future is not to skimp on risk management expenditure, but to delay some of the expenditure, so that it can be invested into growth, until the asset values reach a level, where investment into additional risk management provides a benefit that exceeds the value at risk times the probability of the risk occurring. \n",

            "reflection": "1. Well, while risk management did matter in the game on some level (pun intended), overall it really didn't.  For me it was too heavily dependant on randomness (from now on RNG). Either that or I'm simply terrible at the game. Didn't get past level 4. You have to heavily focus on development to get anywhere. I found out the hard way  that you need to heavily invest in protection as well and use insurance only as needed. Insurance almost always served as the last resort, when things were going south. What I learned and the game conveys really well is that not preparing, be it protection, insurance or research, can set you back  by a lot. Which is one of the key points to take away, I think. Nevertheless, I got angry at the game pretty fast. First of all for not saving any of my previous scores, and then for not being really friendly with my ungodly wrist pain. Click click click click. 2. Differently than the first time? Everything. Tried to heavily invest in protection, then insurance and research. Then I tried out different combinations. To get past the level 2, you need good management. To get past level 3, you need good RNG. What did I learn? Well, nothing I already didn't know - RNG is a b*tch and universe is completely indifferent about how many nicely looking things you have built or how far have you come in your development. So could you get hit by a bus tomorrow. Just like anybody else. So better be protected, err... prepared. While in the game insurance won't do you much, in real life it can be quite a bit more useful, especially in some places of residence. 3. Oh, you know, just this one little thing called \"How about NOT trying to settle our porcelain teapot nation on the surface of a planet being CONSTANTLY bombarded by comets roughly EVERY MINUTE\".   Also caching previous results and codes would have been helpful. TL;DR: Key points: Not preparing for the threat, be it protection, insurance or research, can set you back by a lot. Universe is indifferent and doesn't care about you nor your level of preparedness. For me game was frustrating, and too heavily dependent on RNG. To fill in the rest , I would like to ponder over some things. First -  why people with no video creating capabilities have to write more?  Because, I sure as hell cannot speak at a rate of 200 words per minute comfortably. I'm not a bloody auctioneer. Are video responses preferable and encouraged then? Me: What about what I want... justice? Coursera: If you want justice, then you've come to the wrong place. To you, whomever rates this: Are you interested in sci-fi? http://sifter.org/~simon/AfterLife/  check this thing out.  Won't regret.",

            "reflection": "Risk Management has been a very essential entity for the progress of the community. This is what the game symbolizes and makes us realize the importance of the Risk management. Development  for a nation or an entity needs research which in turn is dependent on technology which also is based on the resources. A developing nation or community cannot plan to focus on research avenues available for development mainly because of high investments. After surpassing the initial stage, resources can be utilized and invested in research avenues. On the whole, the game paid importance to between the growth in development percentage and the level of the ground barrier to be made. Also the research was essential for the community development and overcome the losses occurred during the period. The more time spent on each , the more data gets gathered. Planning and preparation towards research enables the community to showcase better communication and quicker rehabilitation. An arena which needs to be developed, also needs better communication network. For example Disaster Management Devices need to be used in disaster prone areas to save humanity and life stock. A better insurance needed to cope up with losses and essential for minimum investment. Insurance provides a better outlook and more opportunities for development. An insured person can do more work and utilize better resources in better manner. A real truth is that shows that time and resources utilized. That resulted in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I kept some resources for research and preparedness also. Most important, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community. ",

The attitude and counting in this game are completely irrelevant (and childish), though content (aka rules and set-up) appears in line. I would rather design a game  like .those in economics and finance. In the  place I live in, poor work hard to keep rich in their palaces. The myth called taxation never works until  50% is spent on people (That's what they do in Gulf, USA and Northwest Europe. Communists did it without taxation.).

            "reflection": "I found that the game did not always work well depending on the system being used.  E.g. when I used my linux based system, it made the game almost impossible to win, but when using the same system but loading a window OS, I had no problems getting to the higher levels.  This made playing the game increasingly frustrating to play, because on my linux system, I could not use protection to help manage risk and did not know why.  Without protection, risk management became close to impossible, using only two of the three tools.  Once I was able to use all three tools of risk management, the game became quite easy.  In particular, when playing the game I found that it was best to concentrate more on protection and research than insurance.  I found insurance to be close to useless, and instead only used it if there was a remote possibility that a huge meteor would hit and I would be unprepared for such a major hit.  The problem is that the game algorithm was broken, in that you could buy insurance of the highest level just moments before a huge meteor would hit, and prices would not alter.  This does not make sense because you would think that no one would insure a society, knowing that a meteor of great size was just about to hit.  I did find research versus protection to be an interesting dynamic.  But I found that research was a bit too powerful, because it didn't use any resources, and allowed a society to cope and have no damage when a major meteor crashes despite protection levels being relatively low.  Therefore the game needs to be balanced a bit more between the three four tools, protection, insurance knowledge, and coping.  I also found the choice of using protection versus developing the pods to be an interesting choice.  I lost on level 5 a few times, because I did not concentrate enough on development, and instead of protection due to the artificial 3:00 time limit.  I found being just a few seconds away from making the level quota and losing the game in such an artificial manner to be frustrating.  The fact that you had to restart the game from level one was also frustrating.  They could have made the game e.g. to start at two levels back.What I learned from the game is perhaps not the lesson that the writers of the game would want me to learn.  E.g. insurance isn't that important, despite the fact that in reality insurance should be used as a buffer which can transfer resources that one gains in good years to years that are bad, therefore is key for recovery and coping.  The game doesn't really accurately map what insurance does, because it makes insurance a one time fee, rather than collecting over time.  E.g. they could have made the game such that it deducts % of your income at time passes, rather than just having to pay a lump sum.  I also found that research and the subsequent ability to cope was a little too powerful.  If an earthquake hit an actual city, I don't think research alone would help save the city at all.  However with this game, it was a good possibility that research and coping alone would allow that city to survive with no protection preparations.  Overall I found that game to be a little to simple to really get an understanding of what risk management is really like, and could have employed more concepts of cost-benefit analysis.  In addition, perhaps adding in the concept of obstacles, e.g. corruption, lack of information, vested interest, etc. to prevent development and risk management might be interesting component that developing nations have to face, and would make the game instantly more complex and interesting.   ",

This oversight avoid development in the construction of the city because he was unprotected Alora of flooding and destruction by the impact of comets, to the ignorance of this type of kite that would impact adds. Therefore the construction of Alora is difficult when you take into account the factors that favor its development and this is directly related to the elements of risk management such as: (1) insurance to transfer resources across people and time, from good to bad states of nature (2) knowledge to understand shock, internal and external conditions, and potencial outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty (3) protection to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits (4)  coping to recover from losses and make the most benefits, After several attempts to start game note: research (for comets), insurance contracts, and protection (use slider to keep high the city). These precautions are adequate before the impact of the comet, because raising the city, flooding is better scale damage by comet impact are reduced recovers faster losses, greater benefits are obtained to develop city ​​also selogra a higher level in the game. So to achieve a higher level and started playing with the constructs (four units), hired insurance (50%) and investigate comets, according to the available budget. The construction of four units that I would secure better performance was 50%, 25% helped the little, while 75% was a bit difficult to recruit (time and scarce resources). I learned the importance of having a safe time before the negative impacts (comets and floods); Also use protection - slide-bar before impact (reduced damage) Among the difficulties of understanding of the game was: (1) understand categories (1, 2,3 and 4) to investigate comets (2) to determine the amount of insurance available to me after each impact, only indicates the percentage of destruction does not indicate insurance reimbursement. In developing the new version of Risk Horizon I suggest: a table of information about the amount of insurance available after each impact.",

Every possible action\nhad a cost attached. Risk management took the forms of knowledge, protection,\nand insurance, while development took the forms of developing new plots, and enhancing\nand repairing damage to existing ones. The costs of the elements of risk\nmanagement added up quickly; at any point in the game, to have full insurance\ncoverage, protection and knowledge likely meant little or no development was\ngoing on.\n\n            I played the game multiple times, to\nget to level 4 (and 5). The main things I learned were that development and\nrisk management must be equally weighted, and also be coincident; resources\nsitting idle were as detrimental to being able to advance as extensive\ndevelopment with no risk management.\n\n            The game is great. But, for\nimprovement, I would have the knowledge graphic a bit smaller and off to the\nside. Another level of detail could be added such as infrastructure, like basic\nroads. Damage could be to the roads, or power station, airport, etc. Furthering\nthat idea, the setting and overall theme could be slightly more “earth- like”,\nwhile still being abstract and alien, to be a little more engrossing.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The game \"Risk Horizon\" simulates a fictional world \"Alora\" where there's a constant risk of Comet strikes from the heavens. It is our duty as \"The Luminator\", to help Alora develop and grow, while taking necessary precautions against the destruction wreaked by the Comets. We have at our disposal, the ability to \"research\" a comet, thus predicting more accurately, the dangers posed by it; we have the technology to physically raise our community so as to protect against the waves caused by the Comet strikes; and we have the option of buying insurance, to help pay for any damages.In short, we have a system where there's an interplay between knowledge (researching a comet, thus removing uncertainty of the threat), protection ('raising' the community, thus physically protecting from the adverse effects of a comet strike and roping in community involvement), insurance (buying insurance, thus spreading the costs of a comet strike over the insurance network) and coping (recovering from comet strikes), the fundamentals of risk management. Our aim is to mitigate risks as we strive to develop our community, essentially dividing resources (time and in-game cash) between development and risk management. The ambiguous nature of risk was exemplified in the game by the fact that the comet strikes were stochastic events and not completely determinate. Thus, it forces the player to deal with uncertain knowledge, and resort to hedging his/her bets on protection and insurance. Also, since protection gets carried over from one level to the next (unlike insurance), it was easy to see how protective measures taken at one time, contribute towards deflecting a huge threat at a much later time. For example, filling up the protection meter over the first two levels enables us to meet the really huge comet in level three. Of course, protection and insurance also helps us meet the immediate threats as well.I played the game multiple times, and soon realized that time is a precious commodity that must be properly managed. While I was researching a comet, I was not working on developing my pods, which often led to me failing a level. Thus, I started treating time as a scarce resource, which led to better game results. The lessons that I would take away from the game are that first of all, risk management is a balancing act. Tread too cautiously, and opportunities leave you behind. Focus only on opportunities without taking risks into consideration and you can get washed away. The split has to be just right. Secondly, I got a live example of how gamification can lead to better learning. Not only was I motivated to try and ace the game, I connected more with the theory by analogy with the game. Had there been a regular quiz, I would not have been so introspective of the principles of risk management, nor would the ramifications of protection and insurance be so apparent, as it is now.While the game is quite good with respect to the integrated storyline and the analogy that it provides with risk management, I feel the \"insurance\" feature of the game is not properly developed. Unlike protection, insurance does not carry over across levels, and one has to repurchase insurance at a much higher price in the succeeding level. In real life, this is not the case and insurance costs are more stable. If given a chance to redesign the game, I would change this so that insurance is more affordable (perhaps provide the option to buy with equal installments over a level).",

            "reflection": "I found the Risk Horizon game particularly interesting.\n\nAt the level One of the game, I found that it was important\nto begin building a community with the funds available, as without a community,\nthere would in the first place be nothing to protect from unforeseeable events.\n\nThe second most important thing to do right after the\ncommunity starts growing is to avoid possible disaster by investing in research\nthat would prevent the strikes from the meteors\n\nHowever chances are that the work done to prevent meteor\nstrikes might not be enough hence it is important to purchase insurance, so\nthat in the event that such happens and there is damage to the community, the\ncost of reconstruction is partly bourn by the insurance company\n\nI observed that after spending a considerable sum, say\n4/5th, of resources in developing the community, the amount of money available\nto purchase insurance and invest in research is reduced hence my community is\nless protected from a meteor strike\n\nI did play the game a couple of times, at first I didn't put\nin enough effort into research and elevating the community to prevent damage\nfrom meteor strikes hence the community suffered damage each time there was a\nmeteor strike.\n\nHowever at other times I realized I was upgrading the\nbuildings too fast, such that I was draining my resources to fast. At other\ntimes I noticed that not upgrading the pods meant that I wasn't rewarded with\nresources\n\nI think the most important thing for advancing in the game\nis building the community and protecting the community with research. Insurance\nis important in crossing levels, but the minimum/basic insurance is usually\nsufficient.\n\nIf I were to introduce a new feature to the game, I would\nadd something related to crime within the community, and something to show the\neffect of corruption too, and features that would solve these problems. \n\nI would also introduce penalties, for not evenly\ndistributing development across the community, by this I mean that at some\npoint say level 2 or 3 upgrades of pods should be evenly distributed or the player\nloses points.\n\nI’ve learnt that it is quite tricky to balance community\ndevelopment while managing the risks associated with unforeseen occurrences.\nAlso keeping tab on historical records of such events can help us make better\nfuture decisions along the lines of utilizing our resources.\n\nIn all I think the game was very insightful and I have\ndecided to make an effort to finish the game.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The game was quite addictive. I spent a lot of time on it but was unable to get to level 3, perhaps because raising the level of the island was extremely slow on my computer and there were also delays doing \"research\".1. The main trade off was that it was necessary to develop as fast as possible while doing enough research to reduce damage. There was feedback between rounds about the trade off between characteristics of a risk (intensity and probability), level of preparation and damage. However this was not easy to interpret. There was much more sense of continuous \"fire fighting\" than actual risk management.2. Eventually I stopped getting insurance before it was necessary. I am not sure that this was a good thing to learn. I learned that in setting peer review essays like this the World Bank is merely going through the motions of spending a budget on education rather than actually helping people to learn.3. Don't use such an action oriented game. It does not represent risk management choices but real time reactions.",

I noticed that for being possible to develop the \"city\" its necessary take care of the 3 parts, if only research and don't grow the city for example, I won't pass to the next level. By researching the level of severity and the chance of hit can get lower, and by protecting the city I noticed that the chances of the city being hit get lower too. Other important thing is to develop the building and build more to have time to pass the level. What I did different when I played again was trying to mix the trade-offs, and the actions as well so I could pass some more levels in the game and develop more my city. Even so, I couldn't get any further than level 4.  The main thing I learned from the game was to be aware of the trade-offs that exists, and to act fast, don't procrastinate, because when a problem happens, we have to have agility to solve the problems, and like the correct choice to make is usually not clear, we have to look the possibilities available and try to do the best choice and fast as we can, to minimize the losses if something goes wrong.",

            "reflection": "The role or vital importance of risk management in the recommended game practically illustrated how to prepare against risk and properly coping with it’s effects and moving on to the next chapter (in this case level). After taking the tutorials I jumped into the game proper having little knowledge of what was coming my way, but as I played the game over and over again I got used to what I should and shouldn’t do first, that is priority. A popular saying that goes like “proper preparation prevents poor performance” proved true in this game. The risk in this case (game) comet of different strength, intensity kept hitting on my pods, in some cases destroy them for example in one particular case 67% damage was made to them, I had to rebuild them and continue the game. What risk management has taught me is to carefully study each comet, no to presume or assume because surely it’s going to the hit the pods and it’s in my best interest to study them and understand them thereby looking for a possible outlet to the damage and in most cases no damage was sustained. No damage was sustained because I didn’t allow the comet take me unawares, I saw it coming prepared for it and made the best out of it.  After a particular damage on my first attempt playing the game my pods incurred a damage of about 67% and I was to rebuild it. I did that without and insurance and I had about 7 pods and had to do the reconstruction with about $200 each, it costed me a lot, instead of upgrading my pods I went back rebuilding what I had already. During the 2 trial I after building 3 pods I went for a 75% insurance package after which it wasn’t long another comet damaged 50% of my pods at this time I had insurance and it didn’t cost up to $21 to fix each of them, giving me enough balance to continue like nothing happened. At some point I had to go for a higher insurance plan just to big bigger pods and make sure if anything happens to them I can easily and comfortably rebuild them. In all when comets with greater chances of big impacts came around I knew I had to spend more preparing, because if I spent more preparing I won’t have to a lot in rebuilding after the impact. To effectively play this game I had to identify what I was given to start with and how to manage that and allow constant development in my community.If  I’m to develop a new version of this game I’d make it interactive, a questionnaire format that gives you options to progress to the next stage highlighting the roles of the government, bank, international bodies, family and community how and where you will need them. Giving the player 15 minutes period to play the game. On the game board will have a portal you will check for the weather and financial reports which the player must check to know the next line of action to protecting his community. To get the maximum mark, the player must show how to maximize risk and make out opportunities from them by not only preparing for the risk but making sure it opens a way to grow the economy. The player also should be given different kinds of loan plans and he should wisely determine the best course for the community. I’m so grateful to be a part of this exercise. I’m a Nigerian studying in Ukraine and this is exactly what my country need right now. Thanks again.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game is to identify and analyze the financial impact of loss to the community through creating pods with making crucial decisions of purchasing insurance protection against natural disasters like comets' invasions.  This allows me to examine the use of realistic and cost-effective opportunities to balance retention programs like building and repairing pods in the community with 3 different types of commercial insurance against comet attacks.  In the game, I tend to rebuild as many pods as I can to rebuild the community.  As the game prolongs, I tend to buy higher insurance to protect against the potential loss of pods in the community.  The success of the community is based upon the numbers and the health of the pods.  So, my trade-offs were to repair less pods but buy higher insurances to protect existing pods as I play to get to level 2.   Although I made more progress each time, I could not get advanced to pass level 2.  But, I made better choices as I understand the games better.   I think I was not able to advance to level 3 because I was lacking patience to examine all the angles of the game.  However, I felt that I was making better choices each time as I understood the purpose of the game. I felt that preparation for risk with higher insurance allows me to make choices to either repair existing pods or make new pods.   It was difficult to do both at the same time as the resources are depleting rapidly as the comet attacks became more frequent.  I played the games a few times, as I felt that I did not understand the game well.  After the first time I played the game, I went back to the tutorial to better understand the game.  I have learned that going back to the beginning allowed me to make better game plans between repairing pods and building more pods with higher insurance.  As each time I played, I felt that I progressed more and more and made better choices probably because I understood the situation better and thus I was able to understand the decision of making trade-offs.  If I played again, I certainly would go back to the beginning of the game and re-evaluated my game plan with executing different insurance plans at different times,  I have learned that strategic decision making is important when the unknown is present.  The more severe the comets' attacks, the more and better choices I would have to make to sustain a community.   The game pushes me to examine what is the best action to serve the community with common goals.  Of course, this game is designed to test risk managerial skills of one person.  In reality, we have to work with others to make common strategic decisions.  I feel that this was not present in the game.   So, this game may indicate that I may be able to make good risk managerial decisions and not necessary tell me that I would be a good risk manager in reality because of lacking of cooperation with others to make sounded strategic decisions.  If I have to change the game, I propose to add one or more players in each game because choices are made through cooperation with different advisers in real life.  Although it is important to have a leader to make difficult choices, it is wise to get as many advises from colleagues and experts to evaluate all the options.  In the game different insurance plans were presented, but we did not know anything about the plans and the pay-offs of them.   It is difficult to make good choices when we face many uncertainties.   ",

            "reflection": "RIsk Management helped me identify intensity of risk and prepare accordingly. it is a balancing act. We have to choose between best option in investment and community cooperation to mitigate risk. Its important to keep hawks eye on the risk and time it perfectly. Preparation for risk reduced the time to bounce back. I played this game multiple time learning new aspect every time i played. Key is to identify which risk, scale the risk, assess the damage it can cause. Once the risk is properly identified and its time to be prepare accordingly. Damage will be done but the key is to acquire enough knowledge to reduce the damage and be prepare to bounce back. If I could have more tools to identify the risk involved( which becomes more difficult if more number of risk are there) then i can activate the right training and utilize tools to mitigate it and be prepare. Would love to be able to see opportunities as i manage risk. The key is to prosper from it too.Amazing game wish to play again and again.",

            "reflection": "1.  The role of risk management is important in the game. This is because the aim of the game is to build up pods on a barren unpopulated island. However, the island is continuously subjected to the threat of comets. When the comets strike and hit on the island, the pods built will be damaged and the island will be scorched and turned uninhabitable.  \n\nSo, ways must be thought out to build pods on the island on the one hand and protecting the buildings from the threat and damage done by the comets. Ways of protection will involve risk management.           \n\nThe risk management involves a few basic steps and requirements. \n\nThe first step is to do some research on the comets in the sky.  The power to look out into space and learn the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet will give some idea to the player whether to neglect the comet (with little chance of hitting) or step up protection for the comet (with high chance of hitting). Also, the longer you do the research on the comet, the higher chance for you to mitigate the effects of the hit after the comet strikes on the island. \n\nThe second step is to do protection. If the slider on the bottom right of the screen is pressed and held into the upright position to raise your island. By matching the level of protection with the severity of the comet, one will prevent one’s pods from being damaged!\n\nThe final step available is to obtain insurance for the pods built. The insurance policy must be carefully selected so that the smallest premium spent can offer enough protection against the comets striking.\n\nHowever, the preparation for risk will affect the development. When you do the research on the comet, the development will be halted. When you uplift the slider on the bottom right, the development cannot take place at the same time.\n\nAlso, when money is spent on insurance, less money will be spent on the development. \n\n\n2.  If I play the game more than once, I shall do something differently in the second time. In order to achieve optimum progress and wealth on hand, I shall research every comet and neglect those comets with less likely impact possibilities. I shall only raise the insurance coverage had I been sure the coming comet will cause a disaster. Also, I shall raise the slider to raise the energy level to mitigate the impact of the hitting comet. However, I shall upgrade the pods whenever possible.\n\nThe main things are the balance of the risk and protection. In order to obtain the optimum result, one must balance the resources on hand and sometimes moderate risks have to be taken. \n\nAlso, I learnt from the game that time management is important. This is because each game has only 3 minutes and time must be utilized wisely to build up the community and to mitigate any impending and afterwards loss. \n\n3.  This game requires a delicate balance between the various available options in order to build a healthy community. However, if I were to change the game, I shall do replace the “comet” with “typhoon”. Typhoons come every summer to my part of the world and if the impact is direct, much disaster will result on the land area. The research on the “typhoon” will be similar to that of the “comet”.\nThere is one more thing I would add is the option to construct/enhance city drainage in order to mitigate the flooding brought by the typhoons.\n",

            "reflection": "Reflections about the\ngame RiskHorizon0. Technical issues: There are relevant differences between\nworking the game with flasher player compared to Unity web player. This one was\naccessible to me thanks to a link provided in the forum. The behavior between\ndiverse browsers has a conspicuous impact in the gamer’s performance and control\ninstruments. 1. I think this a good game to understand the interaction\nbetween research, protection and insurance. The most relevant to me, in order\nto reach the minimal 4th level is protection and the ability to keep an adequate\ngreen speed in the gauge sensor of development.  The amount of capital and timing were critical\ncombined with a level of protection above 80%. Insurance in this game or at\nleast for the level 4th wasn’t very relevant.2. I played several times. My final and relatively successful\nstrategy was to increase as much protection, without jeopardizing the time to guarantee\nan adequate level of welfare to Alora.  3. I would improve the knowledge (research), perhaps to\nrefine the buildings damaged based on the comet trajectory. The more research I\ncould focus the protection in one subzone.  The insurance aspect apparently is not\nperceptible as relevant. I can purchase some insurance plan but when the impact\nhappens there is no visual reference to figures to compare the advantages of\nthe plan. I would add more time to prepare some strategy as parameters and\nduring the game learn, to adjust those parameters.  An addition to this game, perhaps beyond the scope this\npoint strictly related to knowledge, protection and insurance, is to introduce\nsome elements of sustainability. What are the actions or behaviors that are\nmore sustainable?  I read that in the game\nthere is a “mini game “, where some yellow dots? (I couldn’t see them) can be drag\nand connected,  to express the linkage\nbetween the community. This is perhaps a way to approach sustainability, but I\nwas not able to play with in this game.   In order to represent risk management that matter in the place\nwhere I live, I would propose to use an example with one threat: flooding. My\nhouse is especially vulnerable to flooding. In some cases has been inundated\nand damaged the basement with a critical economic impact. Applying the three elements\nexposed in this course:1. Knowledge. It’s very important to predict when is going\nto rain heavily to keep ready all the provision. Those include an electric\ngenerator because in many cases, when it rains associated with strong winds,\ntrees fall and disconnect the electric power. . A special training to people related\nto our house and eventually neighbors, has been very useful to handle\nadequately the power supply.  The sump\npumps require electricity if there is no power, no drainage possible.  2. Protection. I need to build some drainage system to guarantee\nthat water is no accumulated. Also clean leaves and other debris to avoid drainage\nobstruction3. Insurance. Keep the insurance the clause of flooding is a relief\nto pay the cost reparation for flooding. Another element to include beside the three mentioned in\nthis course is to include the contingency plan. This is very important because\nin many cases to have eclectic scenarios improve the outcomes. In my case of\nthreat for flooding, I included as plan B to have a battery power pump in case\nthe main generator does not work poperly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA final reflection about the risk elements is the need to\nquantify them, in order to be able to\ncompare and predict outcomes based on models. The value of the investment in\nresearch normally is neglected.",

            "reflection": " \n\nAccording to me the main crux of the game is to maintain\nbalance between development and risk. The more we develop the more damage cost\nwe need to bear. But the game has provided us with certain tools to deal with\nthis risk. There are three main tools to deal with the risk they are Research,\nProtection and Insurance. The research tool helps us acquire the knowledge\nabout the comet and if the comet hits the planet we’ll have more time to\nestablish connections with our neighbors and reduce the damage. But every time\nwe do the research we’ll lose some money which will be our sunk cost as this\namount could be used in the development of the community. So how much research\nto be done is the critical decision over here. We could choose the amount of\nresearch to be done depending on the severity of the destruction indicated in\nthe severity meter and accordingly take the risk. Using research is similar to\nacquiring knowledge so knowing more about the event will help us in dealing\nwith the risk better but it has a cost associated with it and the better risk management\nis to establish an optimal balance in between them. The second tool is Protection\nwhich is indicated on a meter to the right. If the severity of the comet\nmatches the meter reading then we could avoid the damage. But the problem here\nis that each comet has a different level of severity and we couldn’t decrease\nthe level of protection after increasing it. And to increase the level of\nprotection we need to spend more money and by increasing the level of\nprotection more than required we are hindering the development.  So here we need to choose that level of\nprotection which can protect us from damages caused by maximum number of\ncomets. The third level of protection is Insurance which can be selected from\none of the three options available. The insurance will bear the cost of damage\nbut choosing the required amount of insurance is critical because by over\nprotecting we can hinder development and by under insuring we need to bear cost\non damaged caused. We need to have a balance among these three tools to protect\nthe community adequately so that development can go on. By doing research based\non severity can buy us extra time to take help from neighbors and as we know\nthe likelihood of that comet hitting us we could wary our strategy of\npreventing from damage could be varied from one threat to another unlike other\ntwo options where the level of protection or insurance ones set cannot be\nchanged from comet to comet. But by setting an adequate amount of insurance and\na particular level of protection depending on our prediction of damage can be\nas useful as acquiring knowledge. \n\nI have played this game only ones and I over protected\nmyself by choosing maximum amount of insurance and by doing so I lost lot of\ntime and also I was not able to develop as there was not enough money available.\nThis strategy seemed good in first level as there was enough money and\ninsurance was also costing low. In my next attempt I will focus on research (which\nI ignored in first attempt) by choosing optimal level of protection and\ninsurance.\n\nIf I\nam allowed to add features then we could spend a huge amount in developing a\ntechnology over different levels to shoot the comets as there should be permanent\nsolution to this problem.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "The game was 'innovation and creativity at its best'. The unique concept on which the game is based taking into account risk management is intellectually stimulating and allows a person to accept ideas and make fast conclusions. The game was an epitome of risk management principles and needed the player to make rapid decisions to avoid risk. The importance of time management to assess risks was also given a lot of importance in the entire process. The very fact that the player had to protect his buildings by increasing their altitude, getting insurance, improving its level and consecutively research on the comets as a measure to determine the risk they pose and clarify details shows the emphasis placed upon time management.There was a lot to tradeoff based on their importance at that particular instance. Sometimes the research done on the comet was too less or otherwise there was not enough development. A right balance had to be maintained. Realising the need at the moment and reacting based on that was very crucial. It does work the same way in reality as situation needs to be understood and right decision has to be taken.If I played the game again, I would be aware of all the various factors in the beginning and would waste much time getting the hang of it. Hnce my decisions will be taken faster and will turn out to be better. The major problem I was facing initially was to recognize the right time to take a particular action. That is what I will try to rectify if I play the game once more. It will definitely make a huge impact as strategic timing of actions is a basic need of risk management.A paid game would definitely do the trick of making it real time and bringing in actual risk factor where if a person loses, he loses the money he has invested and upon winning, a person earns extra money (which is actually a part of the money lost by those who could not win the game). This real time risk factor would trigger that sense of seriousness and panic which happens in any risky situation. That is what I missed in this version of the game because I knew that even if I lost the game, nothing would happen to me. To sum it up, the game was definitely very interesting and brought out core values in risk management to the fore.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was to understand how to protect an establishment while increasing the resilience for the future shocks. While managing the growth of Alora, I tried to establish the town to its full size in level 1 and while doing, researched the comets. Good side about researching is it doesn’t stop your development unlike protection which enabled me to reach to the required level way before the time stopped.  However, starting from level 2, I had to both spend money on insurance (75%) and protection. No matter what, the town strongly depended on insurance more than protection to continue developing. Again, I reached the cap before the stopwatch. In levels 3 and 4, I followed the same pattern with 75% insurance and unlike some comets hitting it, none were able to damage the town.\n\nInsurance always saved my life and minimized amount of protection to the level where I hardly depended on it let me continue to the game with a decent flow of cash while researching the comets and enjoying the growth of the town. In level 5, I thought I was spending too much money on insurance as nothing had been able to damage the town before and I wanted to make a difference and bought an insurance plan of 50% and wanted to concentrate more on the growth of the town as I wanted to grow even faster than before. Well, that ended my growth as one comet hit the town hard and hindered my growth for good. It was too late to raise the protection to the right amount when it hit the town despite the amount of time spent on research it. So the end came.\n\nAlthough I didn’t mention how I played the game in the first trial, I played the game 2 times and reached to level 5 at most. In the first trial, I worked more on the protection and minimized the amount of insurance and couldn’t even reach level 3. On the second try, I did the vice versa and reached level 5. I understood that even though personal protection is important and should be done, private help from the state/government/communities in means of insurance is a must to deal with large shocks and help the community to look to the future for continual growth in the game.\n\nIf I were to change one thing, I wouldn’t decrease the importance of protection that much. Protection shouldn’t change the level meter to red. It’s understandable that protection decreases the growth rate but so does insurance by spending money on something rather the growth. By spending on protection, by raising the hill, you, in a way, are opening up canals that would bring water which are need for the growth of crops as well as your town. The game, from my point of view, was underlining the importance of insurance more than the required amount. It is clear that insurance is important but I, kind of, came to realize that this game was all about the huge importance of insurance while paying little to nothing to personal protection. By balancing this scale between protection and insurance better, it would be more realistic for the game to capture the importance of insurance.",

            "reflection": "The game illustrated main\nprincipals of risk-management, usage of different kind of tools and methods,\nvarious choices and compromises which have to be made. The first point I would\nlike to outline is that coping with consequences of adverse events is much\neasier when certain precautions are made. It may sound quite obvious, however,\nit is necessary to understand that even in case of inevitable risks some measures\ncan be very helpful. So, what were the tools shown in the game?\n\nThe most effective measure (as I discovered it during number of games) was to\nensure long-term protection from meteorites by building higher level of the\n\"city's\" basement. The drawback of it, however, is a necessity of\nwide range of factors, which include (1) time, (2) information, (3) resourses.\nFirstly, \"time\" means that while preventing damage from risky events\n(which, after all, even may not occur) people can not develop their\n\"city\". The time factor is the more important the closer this event\nis. As well as the closer the end of the level is approaching. Secondly, to\nprovide appropriate protection we need information about severity of the\nupcoming event, its possibility, etc. Otherwise, both time and resourses would\nbe wasted without any usefulness. The more information about the event is\nprovided the easier it would be to cope with consequences and the more\neffective undertaken measures would be. Finally, resourse is a significant\nfactor. This may include money (in the game), as well as natural, physical or\nhuman resourses. As in case of time, spending resourses on preventing damage\nmeans that other projects (building and developing houses) should be postponed\nor decreased.\n\nAnother way to make it easier to\ncope with problems is to pay insurance before the risks are undertaken.\nHowever, sometimes it make people more irresponsible, because the insurance\ncompany would pay part (or most) of the reconstruction, which means that the\ncommunity will pay. This game doesn't not show this drawback. We might consider\nthat it does effect on our choice of effective risk-management. Thus, it would be better to implement some conditions for those who use insurance: for instance, they should reach some level of protection or spend at least 3-5 stages of exploration the meteorites. The\ngame provide three options of insurance, that is why during the game we should also take into account is\nusefulness together with other tools. For example, at lower levels, when meteorites\nare not very severe it would be better to prevent damage at all by building\nlong-term protection. Thus, we are both capable of providing such protection\n(of 3 or 4 levels) and save money with buying low-cost insurance. At higher\nlevel, basement construction is much more expensive, so insurance would be\nworth it and reduce costs (by the way, at higher level development of the\n\"city\" leads to more expenditures on reconstruction).\n\nRisk-management is compromising\nbetween different ways to prevent, mitigate and cope with events, considering\nexisting conditions, aims and available resourses. ",

            "reflection": "1. The role of this Risk Management Game was to simulate a real life situation involving risk management. As we was taught in the lectures, By increasing protection and buying insurance we protect are selves from risk but lower are growth.In impoverished areas the costs of protection may seem far more devastating than a crisis. An example is the rising cost of insurance, while it proved effective when the meteors hit it was very tempting to lessen insurance if the research had shown less than a 20% chance of the meteor hitting, balancing out risk with growth.2.Some of the things I would differently if i replayed the game would be to Maximize more growth as my undoing was being to cautious, in a world of risk, sometimes it may be wiser to take growth over low damage or low chance crisis.Some of the things i learned for the game is the real life concept of the risk, and growth as well as my personal preference to more security than growth.One change I would make while playing this game is a human addition, the concept of human population or moral, while this game helps to highlight the basis of risk/development it doesn't do Justice to real leadership descions that don't just involve buildings but the peoples satisfaction and livelihood during such events.Living in an area that is prone to hurricanes i believe that the concept of prediction and research well defines my area.",

            "reflection": "1. Acquiring relevant knowledge about probable damages, insuring these possible damages and securing sufficient protection were the essential instrumental tools to ensure consistent development of the village. Tradeoffs consisted mainly of allocating money between investing in upgrading, full insurance or higher protection. Striking good balance between these three were the key to development. Preparation was my most relied on tool, because it allowed me to concentrate more in the upgrades while being safe on the risk side. While preparation was short term cost with benefits occurring later in the game it saved a lot of money and time from post -damage reparations and constructions. 2.  Yes I played the game several times till I could no longer advance beyond the 5th level. After the initial failures I understood the importance of better protection and hence paid more attention on setting up good protection from the outset of the game. I learned that while building (upgrading) I had to intensively survey the passing comets for risk profiles. Acquisition of the knowledge enabled me to adjust the level of my protection in timely manner hence avoid devastating calamities. Essential it was not to rely just on full insurance coverage. Instead of curing the post accident damages which cost both money and time, prevention via adequate protection saved substantial financial resources and also eased the time constraint.3.  I would add more uncertainty factor into incoming benefits from the plants. In the game it was 100 percent predictable and stable over time, whereas in real life scenarios it is hardly ever possible to fully predict income from the projects. Adding uncertainty into financial profits from the production of the plants would introduce another dimension of risk and hence require risk management in that dimension as well. That meaning financial risk management. All in all, however the game was quite challenging and assembled the main components of risk management that we encountered in the lectures and also the readings. It was nice to see the application of these principles into a funny yet difficult game like this. Thank you for all of your efforts!!",

            "reflection": "An amusing game can offer some profound insights into the\npractices and difficulties of risk management in the economic development in countries\nthat are at risk of disasters. Several features stand out. Risk management is\nthe balancing of time and resources to mitigate the damage caused by opportunistic\nbehavior that is inherently dangerous. It’s necessary to prioritize by\ndetermining what kinds of dangers are present. By assessing the range of\nuncertainties and monitoring the danger, the risk manager can allocate\nresources correctly. This increases the probability that a positive outcome\nwill result and allow a society to increase its economic output. \n\nThere is always a risk in how one allocates available\nresources. Deciding how and when resources are used becomes the deciding factor\nin advancing in the game. The resources are time and money. It may seem to be a\nsimplification, but in life as well as the game, everything can be distilled\ninto these constraints. The game required that the player balance the amount of\nmoney spent on economic development versus money spent to build flood protection\nand money available for insurance. Time is divided between researching\ndisasters versus time spent building defenses. By achieving an optimum balance,\neconomic prosperity can be achieved as signified by advancing in the different\nlevels of the game. Money limits development, so if too much money is spent on defensive\nmeasures, then that slows down development. If too much money is spent on\ninsurance, that also slows down development. Because development depends on reaching\ncertain dollar amounts before further development is possible, then spending\ncan affect development immediately. The best strategy in the game is usually to try to increase\ndevelopment as much as possible and to increase development speed. One can't\nlose focus on development. More development provides a greater economic cushion\nin case of disaster. It also provides greater resources to provide for more defenses. A simple change to the game would be to use earthquakes as a disaster to reflect\nthe problems in California. With such a change, research might try to more\naccurately predict earthquakes – although so far there has been little success.\nResearch in defensive features such as more stringent building codes as well\ninfrastructure that can survive a massive earthquake would be a more realistic\ngame play. Multiple disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, drought, and floods would\nmore realistically model Californian risks. In other countries, hurricanes,\ntornadoes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and winter storms might be used. Fortunately\nfor our world, the dangers of asteroid collisions are probably rare.Although natural disasters are an important and cost effective type of risk that can be mitigated especially for the least developed societies, It is only one category of the myriad disasters that can befall a country. A large earthquake can destroy nations in a matter of hours. The Indonesian tsunami, the Haiti earthquake, the Sichuan earthquake are sudden and mind numbingly destructive, but the devastation from disease, famine, drought, war, can be more devastating. Because the effects can stretch over years, decades, generations, they frequently escape widespread publicity except when a TV show or newspaper decides to do a \"thought\" piece that highlights the problems. These problems are frequently intractable, not the least because they frequently have financial, political or ideological motivations as a root cause and so cannot be resolved by the installation of warning sirens. The economic damage can be even more far reaching than a sudden destructive force. Diseases such as malaria, AIDS, and ebola have devastated continents. The people are left weakened and unable to work. Life expectancy is drastically cut. Risk is widespread. Damage is universal and the need for solutions absolutely urgent.",

            "reflection": "\n\nQuestion 1.\n\nRole of risk management in the game:\n\nThe role of\nrisk management in the game was to sustain and grow the community of pods in\nthe face relentlessly threat of devastation by way of comets crashes. \n\nWhat choices did you make and what\ntrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?\n\nThe\nprimary choices made were between research (knowledge) and insurance. Perhaps\nbecause I did not any higher than level three, protection did not play a major\nfactor. Growing the community of pods faster certainly meant that there was\nincrease in the density of targets thus the need for more insurance.\n\nIn what ways did preparation for\nrisk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe\npreparation for risk, i.e. research, provided more knowledge in the form of\nmonetized resources. This “knowledge” enabled me to sustain and grow the\ncommunity aftershocks occurred (comet crashes). More research also gave me some\nindication of how much protection (insurance) to purchase. Also, the issue of\nupgrading the pods versus purchasing more insurance was tradeoff that was\ninteresting because why should upgrades be such an important issue..\n\nQuestion\n2.\n\nIf you played the game more than\nonce, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main\nthings you learned from the game?\n\nI played the\ngame several times. I experimented with varying scenarios. One scenario that I\nplayed involved avoiding purchasing insurance as opposed to another scenario\nthat involved purchasing lots of insurance. The more insurance bought based on\nresearch, the more successful I was in getting to higher levels. This was true\nup to a certain point as insurance became more and more expensive at the cost\nof upgrading the pod community. I had difficulty understanding why I should\ncontinue to build and upgrade the community which was under constant threat of\ntotal destruction.\n\nQuestion 3.\n\nWhat change would you propose to\nbetter represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nI would propose that the option to migrate out\nthe current scenario to another “place” and thus assume the risk consequences\nassociated with that migration. It doesn’t make much sense to remain in\nsituation where one is under constant threat of total destruction and unable to\nimprove the condition.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk-management in this game is very high. Virtual model of\nthe process in this game has high risks and opportunities. It is very important\nto analyze situation at all, to collect information about all important risks\nand develop preventive actions. Then it is very important to analyze how these actions\ncould influence on pod’s community and result of project.  There are several risks here – shocks by comets and low growth of pods. Risks:  Every\ncomet has short characteristics – severity, hitting.  The total recourses are limited. Every minute\nwe need to make a decision – how and when to spend money more effectively.  Preventive actions: I used knowledge, protection and insurance but my strategies changed.So it is\nvery important to reach balance between preparing for risk and investing in pods’\ndeveloping.  First attemptAt my first attempt I spent all my money on building and upgrading pods,\nso I hadn’t free resources for protecting my pods. All my pods had been damaged,\ngame was over – my recourses were limited.   After first attempt I understood that I need invest in protection. Second attempt So in my next attempt I tried to spend money on preparation for comet’s\nhit.  I bought full insurance, raised\nprotection at maximum bars, but this attempt was unsuccessful too – I hadn’t resources\nfor growth generated from the pods to proceed to the next level. Third attemptAt my third attempt I tried to find balance between risk preparation and\ndeveloping my pods. I built many pods at first level, collected knowledge for comets. If\nthere is a low severity (two bars) I used protection slider for protection. In\ncase of comets with high-level severity I bought insurance.    So I think that the best strategies\nfor this game are following: 1.  Try to upgrade the pods as\nfast as it is possible; 2. Spend time for comet research, especially for the high severe strikes;\n3.  Protection is also a key to\navoid the damage. I raised the level of protection and hold it until it matches\nwith the level of the severity of the comet.  \nI like this game, thank you very much for it. I want\nto add only one thing – history of my actions and some information – how my\nactions (may be group of actions) influence to result of game.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSorry for mistakes, English language is not my native language.",

            "reflection": "As the saying goes \"No gain, without Pain\", justifies that Risk Management was necessary to be undertaken in the game for the development of the community.The life style of the people is measured with the help of the Development Index of that community. Development needs resources, resources need technology and technology needs research. A community struggling for its setup can not think of investing in research areas because of its high costs and complexity. Investment in Research arena is a huge challenge and is full of risk. After crossing through this start up phase, resources can be pooled accordingly and then be invested in the research area. In the context of the game,a balance was needed between the growth in the development percentage and the level of the ground barrier( symbolizing technology) to be raised. Moreover, Research was also important because it helped the community to tackle and cope up with the losses. The more time the community spent on this area, the better information it had accumulated. Plus, preparedness through research also enabled the community to spare some time towards better communication and faster rehabilitation. An area to be focused by any developing community is the importance of having a good communication network. An Adhoc Network must be set up in every disaster prone area to have an emergency contact with the habitats. Sometimes this emergency network can prove to be life saving medium of communication post a disaster. Survivors can help each other during these crises time so that losses can be minimized. During a disaster, their is a huge loss of life and property. Life losses can not be prevented, but after shocks due to loss of property can be minimized. One of the effective way is to undertake a better insurance policy which will help to cope up with the losses in minimum costs and investment. Insurance provides a back bone and courage to actually adopt risk for a better opportunity. An insured person can undertake more work and can utilize resources in a better manner. One hard truth that nature displays is that the time and resources that have to be utilized for the development scheme,some of them have to be used for preparedness against any disaster. That results in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, rather slowed down, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I had reserved some resources for research and preparedness. Most importantly, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. Sometimes, after shocks of a disaster leave a long lasting effect on the life of the effected people.The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community. ",

            "reflection": "1. Risk management was used in the game to mitigate the effect of a meteor crashing and damaging the pods in the game. This was achieved through knowledge (researching the meteors impact, and building up time to decrease its damage), protection and insurance. In the game all aspects require time of which only 3 minutes per level is available. A trade-off needs to be made made in terms of resources and time as to what apsect needs to be addressed first. Initially it is necessary to develop, in order to increase income, while at the same time deciding whether to insure or protect the pods from damage from the meteors. The damage from the meteors can also be reduced by researching them. If development occurs to quickly their is not enough protection for the pods due to lack of resources. However, if to much protection is provided, there is not enough time to gain knowledge about the meteors. Further, if the damage from meteors is only insured, the time taken to repair the pods greatly decrease the time available for development. By preparing for the risk, time was not required to repair the pods, more resources were available to develop the pods, and in the case of protection very little damage occurs to the pods.2. The first time I played the game I did not use protection adequately, and spent the majority of my time on research. This resulted in much of my time being spent on repairing the pods. The game taught me that their needs to be a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance in order to allow for development, and future growth.3. In the game it is possible to avoid any damage by providing high levels of protection, combined with research. The importance of insurance is understated, as in the majority of cases protection results in zero damage. In real situations this is not the case, insurance is required to cover options tht cannot be protected. A possible addition to the game would be to have protection, but only for certain pods, while other pods are still vulnerable to damage. This would more accurately represent real world situations where certain areas are more susceptable to damage from natural disasters than others.",

The choices I made were I started the development of the\npods, then when the comets started coming I would increase protection to match\nthe severity of the shock. As I went further, with more developments and\nupgrades, I got Insurance to mitigate the effects of the shocks produced by the\nfalling comets on the pods I had developed, in case there was a hit. In the\nfirst level, raising the height of the area I had developed decreased the chances\nof the comets hitting and destroying the pods but as I went on to the second,\nthird and forth levels, it was difficult to balance preparation with the shocks\nand I had a couple of hits. I also did not understand how to create community\nconnections before the comets hit, as was stated in the rules of the game.\n\nThe first time I played, I invested\nmore time and resources on protection which cost me more. Subsequently, I tried\nto research more, checking the severity and chances of hits, however, it was difficult\nto interpret the results and act on them, I also got more insurance, that is,\nthe more developed the pods became I bought more insurance than the previous so\nthat incase I had damages, they would not cost too much resources to repair.\nAlong the line, I realized that, the notches on the research bar increased per\nthe number of times I clicked on the comets before they fell, and when they did\nhit, I had the challenge of averting the severity of damage on the pods. I also\nlearnt that, the more upgrades I made on the pods, it increased my resources to\npermit me make various choices like buying insurance, getting more protection\nand doing much more development.\n\nHaving a chance to contribute to the\ngame I would work on the research aspect of the game and even place a button\nfor research on the game board. I would make research more explicit so that,\nanyone playing would not only have knowledge of the shocks but be able to\nfilter it and make well informed decisions and choices, when balancing preparation\n(knowledge, protection and insurance) and coping from the effects of shocks.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Proper risk management simply means that you should strike a balance between the effort being put in the development and the resilience to unexpected events which may negatively affect the development. The resilience itself should be built based on knowledge to know how much protection is sufficient and how much insurance is required. By having the knowledge, you can judge the impact in case something bad happens and the chance of the occurrence, such that you can plan ahead to mitigate the risk. On top of that, community engagement also plays a vital role in the execution.The main things I learnt from the game are:  If you focus too much on development and disregarding the risk, you will pay for it when something bad happens (the development can be severely ruined without proper protection  insurance). However, if you focus too much on protection  insurance, you will miss the opportunity for growth (the speedy advancement of development).In summary, you have to gather the necessary knowledge on what's good for the development and the risks, plan ahead how fast you have to advance and strike a balance on building resilience(don't wait until something bad happens to you), flawless execution  community engagement are also key to success (because without the help and teamwork from the community, your plan may falter. Therefore, effective communication and support from the community are also required)If I were given a chance to improve the current version of the game, I would give additional details/data of how much return being generated by having additional pod vs upgrading the existing pod (and also how it affects the development bar). This is because without the data, it will be very difficult for the players to make informed decision on what's best for development, whether he/she should add more pod or to upgrade to achieve optimal development. This also greatly affects the final result because if the player can have greater rate of development at the beginning of the game, it will really help at the latter part since the player will have more resources to have a better protection and to advance in the development.Another thing which can be improved from this game is the knowledge gained by doing research on the meteors. The knowledge should stay and be accumulated with every meteors being observed. In the current game, it seems that the knowledge is just specific to each different meteors.",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon is a simple but a very interesting game that helps us to obtain some practical knowledge about importance of risk management to succeed. The main role of risk management in the game is to identify, evaluate and reduce risks of damaging the growing city by objects from the space. And if the damage was happened, repair it cheaply (with proper insurance police). In the game I made many choices based on knowledge about space objects (probability of hit, power of posible damage), level of protection (upgrade or not the landscape) and the price for insurance (what policy to buy) to get the best result. Olso, need to mention, preparation for risk affected development immediately in this high paced environment.Each time when I played the game again I tried different strategies in risk management to achieve the better result in development. I paid mone attention to knowledge about space objects and tried to calculate quickly what type of insurance I need to buy (if anyone).There were many thing I learned from the game:- you need to be highly adaptable for changing environment to make right dicisions;- all risks must be properly evaluated;- gathering a required amount of information is very helpful for risk analysis and continious development;- information about past events can be very useful as well as for insurance decisions and for the risk minimization;- the more we prepared more benefits we will obtain from risk management;- insurance can be very helpful when it used with reasons and clear reasons;- anyone can achieve good results with proper risk management;- the fourth planet is the deadliest )There are many uncertainties in the place where I from. Therefore I would propose to add to the game some unexpected events for each level with some limited time to choose from proposed variants for solving them. I my opinion it will help not only better represent the risk management choices but also approximate the game closer to our life.",

            "reflection": "I begin this\nshort paper saying that I really enjoyed this little exercise that apparently\nseemed like a pretty simple game and instead it turned out a real challenge.\n\nIn the game the\nmain role of risk manager is to decide how to balance the three components\nprovided to ensure the development of pods. Since I consider myself a\nrisk-averse individual I immediately opted for the maximum level of insurance\nin order to have enough liquidity to rebuild everything in case of impact with the\nasteroid. Then I split a part of my money equally between knowledge and\nprotection. I don’t know if that was a good choice because at the beginning of\nthe game, having spent a significant part of my money in insurance, I had to\nstart the development of the pods very slowly. Going forward, however, I still\nmanaged to pass the first level. Then I increased the development of pods. In\ngeneral I initially spent heavily to prepare well the possible impact of the\nasteroid more than to the massive growth of pods. \n\nI played the\ngame two times. On Monday I played the game only once and I failed the second\nlevel due to too much damage as a result of an impact a few seconds from the\nend of the timer. Today I played again focusing more on protection than the\nfirst time and proceeding to the development of pods gradually. In this way I\nactually got a better result. If I had played it a third time I think I would\nlean more on knowledge and protection of choosing a cheaper insurance. In this\nway I would have avoided spending a lot of money at one time being able to\nbetter distribute the remaining dollars over the long term.\n\nIt is clear that\nthe three components of risk prevention proposed by the game are absolutely the\nmost important to be able to cope with a sudden and disastrous event; however\nthere are other components that were not considered such as the cooperation. I\nlive in the European Union and for us it is very important the cooperation of\nthe Member States in taking important decisions of different nature to help each\nother. That’s way to improve the game I propose to introduce the possibility of\ninteracting with closer planets so that you can take international agreements\nthat may contribute to the collective growth and lower costs for the reduction\nof risk. For example this could be achieved with the passage of information\ngathered about the asteroids from one planet to another if the celestial body\ncould hit more planets.",

            "reflection": "After several attempts at the “game”, I began to wonder why\nI was sitting there wasting valuable time which such and pointless activity.\nWhile, it is not my expressed attempt to be negative or critical, I believe it to\nbe inevitable that it will be perceived in that light. Since negative comments,\neven though accurate and true or based on personal opinion, usually elicit\nnegative responses, I am prepared for that to be reflected in my peer assessment\nscore.\n\n \n\nWhile it might have been the MOOC professors sincere intent\nto demonstrate the principles of risk management, discussed so far in this\ncourse, using this game, I think it failed to do so. While it could be argued\nthat this game was intended to provide a simple example of risk management\ntechniques, I found it quite a pointless exercise. \n\n \n\nSo far in this course, we have discussed many examples and\nelements of the negative effects and consequences of poor or nonexistent risk\nmanagement, whether as a result of lack of information, failure to act and\nprepare or because of the lack of available capital. When this situation\nexists, the people easily become the victims of unexpected shocks with\ndevastating consequences almost always resulting in loss of lives and capital\nassets.  Conversely, we also studied of\ncommunities/states that have learned from past failures and have put into place\neffective safeguards and shock “buffers” using effective risk management tools.\nThey often accomplish this by gathering and studying accurate data and also\npooling resources for the common good. While this often does not completely eliminate\nthe shock effects (short and long term), it goes a long way in lessening the\nnegative effects (such as the shelters in Bangladesh). Other communities have\nlearned to use risk management tools to provide future opportunities (Ethiopia –\nProductive Safety Net Program).\n\n \n\nPart of the failure of the game, in my opinion, is that it\nfailed to provide any opportunities for improvement and development. Rebuilding\nhouses after being hit by the comets were not growth opportunities, they were\nsimply methods to return to previous pre-shock levels. Further, I think the\ngame was overly simplified and polarized in its focus on capital expenditures\nand the purchase of a single insurance product. It does not provide for any\nother insuring mechanisms. \n\nIt was also singularly focused on the loss of property, and\nnot the more important elements of loss of human lives and resources. These\nelements are often non-renewable and irreplaceable. Should we have drawn from\ninference that the destruction of those buildings also correlated with the loss\nof human lives? There was no evidence of this, therefore could not be a logical\nconclusion. \n\nThis game is certainly not a good example or exercise in the\npractices of effective risk management, since effective risk management usually\nworks to minimizing spending and available resources while also minimizing the\nnegative effects (short and long term) and reducing the future effects of the reoccurrence of a similar shock. \n\nTo improve this game I would make it more inclusive of other\nmore realistic elements involved in shocks, and also increase the speed of the\ngame. I would have preferred a case study allowing us to design a recovery plan.",

            "reflection": "Game Relection ExerciseThe role of risk management was to demonstrate that\nfor every decision is made, it involves risks to assume. Risks are everywhere\nand whether or not desirable to avoid, they can become in interesting\nopportunities in order to improve aspects of our quotidian life. In the game, I\nmade choices of improve the protection of the planet against the meteorites so\nI spend some money in order to increase it. I faced some interesting trade -\noffs in terms of knowledge because I spent some time looking for information of\nthe meteorites and, unfortunately, I could not increase the planet’s protection\nor upgrade buildings; insurance was other because of the money I spent. One way\nthat preparation affected development was when I picked up the insurance, I had\nsome doubts about buying it because the majority of meteorites failed to\nimpact, so I was buying a probability of being secured in case of an impact\nthat possibly would’ve never occurred, and with that money I invested in\ninsurance I could have upgraded buildings faster.I liked the game. For that reason I played the game more than once and when I tried it for the first time I get\nonly to level 1 because I focused on defense instead of upgrading buildings or\ndoing some research, so citizens disapproved my management. I finished level 5\non my third time and for getting that level I decided to increase defense only\nwhen I felt citizens were happy with my resources’ management. The main things\nI learned for the game are that, unfortunately, citizens really don’t care too\nmuch about safety and prevention and it really can cost you popularity and\nauthorities that are concerned by popularity will prefer not to invest in\nprevention and we can see some examples in Latin American, Asian and African\ncountries that by not being prepared to prevent risk systematic. Another thing\nI learned was the importance of acquiring insurance in case of a collision\nbecause it helps to get some resources in order to reconstruct infrastructure.\n\n\n\nFinally, If\nI had the opportunity to participate in a new version of the game, I will try to\nadd social conflicts such as emigration and diseases because those issues are\nvery common in non-developed countries. Also I will insert topics such as sustainable\ndevelopment and the option to interact with organisms such as UN in order to complete\nmissions and reach goals such as millennium goals.",

            "reflection": "Risk management within the game was\ndesigned around safeguarding a targeted revenue stream, whilst trying to\nprotect the assets required to generate the revenue. My initial approach was to\ntry to evenly balance between knowledge, protection and insurance, however\nafter a several attempts it became apparent that this was not feasible.\n\nAs a result of the first few attempts, it\nappeared that knowledge was best applied against the most catastrophic events,\nreflecting that enhanced knowledge of a likely occurrence and subsequent level\nof preparedness allowed adequate time to react to and to cope with the shock,\nthereby reducing the impact to much more manageable levels, in some instances\neven down to zero impact.\n\nFocusing knowledge in this way, allowed me\nto quickly identify and categorise the various levels of risk to be faced in\nthe foreseeable future, which subsequently freed up resources to deal with\n“routine” shocks through the use of protection and insurance.\n\nThe mechanics of the game clearly\nhighlighted to me the importance of using knowledge, protection and insurance as\na comprehensive toolkit in managing risk, and that to try to use one, or even\ntwo, without the other would result in failure.\n\nHaving identified these issues, I changed\nmy approach to then ensure that I provided the highest level of insurance\nallowed, together with the highest level of protection I could afford without\ncompromising my ability to meet the financial target, and then focussed\nknowledge collection on the most catastrophic level of events in the\nforeseeable horizon. This allowed me to progress to the higher levels\nconsistently on several attempts as I refined the methodology. Unfortunately\ntheir was a glitch in the simulation, and the game reported a null error on\nlevel six several times.\n\nThe modified approach above allowed me to\nprogress development relatively evenly and consistently with minimal impact\nfrom the inevitable shocks.\n\nThe simplicity of the game allowed it to deliver a powerful message and demonstrate the key principles of Risk Management, however given the opportunity to make one change in the game I would introduce a more defined risk vs reward mechanism. Currently the game allows a facility to be built which can then be subsequently upgraded. The cost of each upgrade becomes increasingly expensive. Given the financial target that has to be achieved you have no choice but to upgrade as there is limited space to build basic facilities. In my version of the game, I would provide a large enough playing field that the player could conceivably meet the financial target for at least the first few levels. A level 1 building would of course have restricted income, low resilience against shocks and limited insurance availability which would reflect a traditional income in some regards. If the player then chooses to upgrade, the player would be rewarded with better insurance, exponentially better income and higher resilience allowing faster (and cheaper) recovery after sustaining a loss. This would help demonstrate the individuals ability to contribute towards his/her own protection through managing risk at the personal level. ",

            "reflection": "From this game, I think the role of risk management is to\nbalance the build of the planet, avoidance of hit, and to the insurance with\nlimit capital.  \n\nAs the video talked in week2, we can use knowledge,\ninsurance, and protection to lower the damage of the risk before it happens.\nThis game reflects these factors so well. During the game, I gain knowledge\nabout the severity, change of hit of the milestone; also I can buy insurance at some cost for different levels to\nprotect my community; last, the protection can also be applied by click the\nright corner to increase the horizon to avoid the hit.\n\nPersonally, what I usually do in the four levels is to build\nthe planet first, then use the time period to “research” to lower the case of\nbeing hit, then quickly to increase the protect level by click the right\ncorner.  I bought the insurance at the\nbeginning, the level will be according\nto the money I have currently, so that the damage will be limited. \n\nAt first level, I always got hit, but because I had\ninsurance, so I do not need to spend lots of money to repair that. And also,\nwith the level increase, it needs my reaction more and more quickly, otherwise\nthe hit will happens and destroy the\ncommunity.\n\nI played twice; I did only one thing in the first try, like\nonly research, or only build the planet; and at second time, I did things\nsimultaneously, so the result was better. In my second try, I almost get no hit or no damaged, which means the\nprotection works. And to the end I tried to buy no insurance just for\nexperiment, and then I found as long as I had an enough horizon and research,\nthe community would be no damage even got hit.\n\nThe main things I learned from the game is that to protect\nsomething against risk, the better way is to build a system, which means, not\nonly depends on one method, but to build the warning system in many ways at\nsame time, so that the loss will be minimum, for example, to combine the\ninsurance and protection together, meanwhile build the predict and warning\nsystem. Also, we cannot ignore the low possibility risk, because it still may\nhappen and cause bad result.\n\nIf I have a chance to modify something, I may add a “live”\ncharacter, like a human being, who can help to do the things, but the player\nhave to spend time to set the action of the character advanced.",

            "reflection": "Role of risk management in the gamein this game the risk assessment management was essential in fact it was mainly the purpose\nof the game. Acquiring knowledge through asteriods observation was indeed the\nbest way the fastly increase the wealth level for your society. The fact you can only do one action at the time obliged you to make choices on the given time.Choices and trade-offs in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance Indeed the obvious choices was to acquire knowledge through asteroids to be able to make educated decisions. To be able to develop the construction one of the first step was the protection through the lanscape elevation against the floods. In the end, the insurance subscription only worth it when the construction value is important enough to not want reconstructng or reparing at full price after damaging.Preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Good Preparation for risk is the best way to protect assets. In the game given the possible choices, every decisions made take over the previous one because you can only accomplish one action at the time. Knowledge is the best weapon to advance in the gameand reach the objectives.What did you do differently after the first time?On the first try, the game was setup in such way it was harsh to reach the third level. At the second try, the parameters were obviously change allowing an easier progression.On the second try, I found out my first guess was the right one because the best way to increase weaith was through knowledge with asteroids observation and in the second hand with construction.Protection is essentialonce you have started constructing the first households for protecting from floods.Insurance is requiered only once the construction have reached a certain value making it relevant not to want to restart from scratch in case of damages.What were the main things you learned from the game?Risk management covers different aspects where many variables have to be taken into account. The game allows to see and apprehand in a tiny scale the relation between causes and effects in the real world for every decision taken regarding the risk management.What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The natural disaster treated in the game is floods aside from the asteroids impact (possible but still rare and unlikely).A possible change to add to the game would be to me a sewer system development to deal witjh the floods evacuation as the after effect of the disaster. The development level would have directly impact the lenght of the damage on the construction. It would give a choice between insurance and investment on the long term for an other aspect of risk management.To conclude, the game grasp the core of risk management through the interaction between the different variables that result in the end to prove a successful or failed risk management policy.",

            "reflection": "The game took a bit to understand.  Insurance was self explanatory, as was building and upgrading structures.  The metorites were the only threat to worry about as far as I could tell.  And I am not sure what elevating your community is analagous to in real life, besides just a general risk mitigation tool.  I discovered the only way to make money is to build and upgrade structures as fast as possible.  In the beginning this was easy and cheap.  Insurance wasn't a real worry.  And my only mitigation was elevating my community.  As my community became more expensive, i.e. upgraded, I found insurance to asl increase in price, but also the coverage increased.  Meaning when my buildings started to cost over $500 to upgrade, the $135 insurance for 50% coverage for my community was worth it.  However, I never used my insurance, so in those terms it was a waste of money.  I never determined the point of research.  It didn't seem to save me any money or prepare me any better.  It actually began to waste my time I could have been using to build or prepare in other more applied mannors.  If I was to develop a new version of the game, I would explain more or make a differentiation between where you build your community structures in terms of economics.  One would think it would be more economical to have development near water than inland, however with tsumani risk from metorites, the risk of shore line building would also be higher.  I would also introduce another threat.   Applying this game to my community is an interesting application.  I live in South Florida, and flooding risk is quite high.  We are used to getting hurricanes, so are prepared for the wind.  But the storm surge that comes with them is hard to prepare for when the land is just about at sealevel.  Some homes prepare by building up on stilts.  We also have installed breakwaters, and are starting to restore mangrove islands which not only take the wave action, but also absorb some of the storm surge.  Insurance is difficult here.  We are actually forced to have home owners insurance if you have a morrgage on your home, which in my opinion is a champion of insurance lobbists and a failure on the side of the citizen.  I know every few people that have claimed any value remotely close to the astronomical fees they pay in insurance, and this is after living through two major hurricanes that centered right over my town.",

            "reflection": "The game risk horizon tests different outcomes regarding different approaches at managing risk. The role of risk management in the game was to develop the community, facing the hazardous  asteroids that can ultimately compromise its well being and the ability to grow. In order to face the situation there were tools available that allowed for preparation. Research of the asteroids allowed for the creation of community connections before the comet hits this way  acquiring knowledge, long term protection was achievable by raising the position of the island preventing greater damages. The last measure to prepare for the worst was insurence that could be bought to reduce the costs in the event of a rebuilding process.After an impact coping would be achieve through the rebuilding of the community depending on the damages, although its amount and the costs associated with the process would differ significantly depending on the preparation measures taken.All the preparation would impact the development of the community as it would consume resources in order to prevent greater setbacks. Some mechanisms like insurance would allocate a greater of money right away and the other two (insurance and raising the island level) would consume resources over time. In the end development would not be at its full potential of growth but it would withstand an hit minimizing the impact on the community. Great risk management capabilities can have great impacts in the communities helping distributing the available resources it ways where a perfect balance between prosperity and security is achieved.The first time I played I reached a pretty good balance between preparation, growth and coping with the hits reaching immediately the level 4. Although the second time I played I seeked greater preparation which caused immediately a significant decrease in development of the community, compromising the objectives which meant that I would not achieve the goal and therefore I only reached the third level. In the third and last attempt and with the knowledge of the previous games I was able to find the perfect balance between preparation, development and coping reaching level five. This was the major message I learned by playing the game, that sometimes its hard to find the right balance, that development can be easily compromised but if we are not prepared, damages can be great. Risk management is no easy task.If I was tasked to develop a new  version of the game I would take its complexity to the next level and add other resources besides only money, for example the human factor. Human resources would need to be manage and distributed through the different activities (more people in one activity, less time it would take) and  upon an asteroid hit they would ultimately also be affected.",

            "reflection": "1. As in any venture Governmental, NGO or private, managers have to access resources, risk and reward to create the best environment. This does not always mean aiming for the highest potential as if the risks are too high then a lower level of survival may be preferable to a one in million success... In this case the risk management aspect was to grow the community whist also protecting it. The insurance aspect and raising the land height to preserve the growing community are comparable to real life situations... one could imagine that instead of comets we are raising the land against it is a neighbouring country we are raising an army against or a Tsunami we are raising a wall against, on the insurance side, it is to make comparisons with insuring a crop against bad weather...In this case growing the community has been simplified to building shelters but in real life managers will have to choose between investing in housing, schooling, infrastructures like roads, clean water and electricity...To 'win' this game I realised that there would have to be trade offs, there is a time factor in which you need to have grown the community to an 'acceptable' size but if you do not take care of the community it may well get destroyed and then you are worse off than you started...2. In the first iteration I went heavily on the insurance up front and raised the island as much as possible... but never even got close to reaching the necessary development goals, each successive iteration I did more development at the start, although I never quite got the understanding of whether I was using the insurance correctly and each iteration played to differently for me to get a real feel for the game play...3. To make one change? If I could make one change it would be in the development, construction choices... image SimCity (if you are old enough or what ever the modern equivalent is... by creating and building/buying the right infrastructure your habitats could be become more defensive or more capable of earning money or more capable of resisting damage or with heavy investment in education for example more capable of coming up with 'brain waves' to solve the problems...In fact having written this (and still having another 200 words to write) if i had to make one change I would like to team this with a Sim City style game. Wouldn't it be fantastic to have the opportunity to build your own city/country including infrastructure but to then also have it subject to real life problems/disasters/social shocks and see how your soloution and fore-thinking cope. It could even be set within different times, geographical locations and economic settings! Maybe this is already out there, if it is please post the name in the comments section of the marking, where it says to write the one thing that you think would make this reflection better!",

            "reflection": "Using risk management as a guide in the game played a great role in guiding my decisions when I played the game. In the first instance, the game is set up in such a way that it is prone to disasters which present a situation in which one has to apply the knowledge acquired during the first when playing the game. Building puds, buying insurance and also increasing the level of your community when playing the game are strategies which does not only prevent your community from disasters but in present a situation in which can simply recover from it if its occur. for instance, if you buy insurance when playing the game, in instances when you are hit you can easily use the insurance you bought to help you recover for from the hit. And as we where told during the start of the putting measures in place in order to recover form a disaster is a proactive way to manage risk.I was to play the game for the second time the first thing I will do is to increase the strength of my puds to help build more effective protective mechanism in place to not only protect my community but to reduce the causalities when it occurs. As it is specified in the note, one of the reason why risk management is important is as a result of the fact that it helps to protect people and properties from disasters and also hazards. This is because, with a proactive risk management strategy like information sharing, building standard structures as it was in the case of Bangladesh or Chili, properties and lives will be protected during and after disasters.  One of the changes I will add to the in order to provide a more effective risk management strategy is to create more space for puds to be built and also increase the the amount of insurance one can buy when playing the game. Increasing the strength of structures has a lot to do with time one can spend in playing the game. This is because of the fact that when hit by the rocks, the stronger the puds are the more your community can be protected from the impact of the hit. Also, ensuring that more space is created for a player to buy an insurance that  cost like $100 will also help in recovering after you are hit which will reduce the cost involve in the entire process.  ",

            "reflection": "Risk management\nallowed one to make slow but steady economic progress.  By doing research I obtained information\nabout the severity and the likelihood of potential threats.  That information allowed me to immediately\nstart protecting the developments that were underway.  Additionally, by expending resources to\nobtain knowledge, start protective efforts and purchase insurance, I was able\nto reduce the potential of harm and the extent of any harm that did occur.  However, effective risk management came at a\nprice.   Preparing for risk by engaging\nin protective efforts consumed my time and took me away from creating\nadditional developments to increase economic activity.  Additionally consuming resources by\npurchasing insurance decreased my ability to develop new properties.  In other words, preparing for risk affected\nthe pace and extent of development. \nPreparing for risk management forces one to trade off risk management\nefforts versus the amount of development. \n\n\n\n\n After playing the game the first time, I\nrealized that I needed to use my budget to start as many developments as\npossible.  Engaging in several rounds of\nthe game taught me that it is important to use ones resources to purchase a\nsignificant amount of insurance as soon as possible as well as increase ones\nprotective efforts fairly early during each round.  This would enable one to focus afterwards on\nusing knowledge to anticipate shocks as well as spend a sizeable amount of time\ndeveloping properties.  The game also\nseemed very realistic.  One was forced to\nevaluate the likelihood and severity of a threat in order to decide whether one\nwas going to engage in protective efforts and/or buy insurance versus spending\nresources on development.  As one went to\nhigher and higher levels of the game, it seems as though one needed to take\nmore and more risk by delaying protective efforts and building more\ndevelopments.  I believe this risk taking\nwas necessary to be more successful at the game.  \n\n \n\nThe game did not seem\nto offer a convenient way to get communities to collaborate to protect\ndevelopment.  Maybe I did not understand\nhow to operate the risk management tools but I was unable to get communities to\ncollaborate to protect from risk or minimize the impacts from risk.  Living in the United States provides me with\na tremendous amount of resources and well developed communities.   Communities here would benefit tremendously\nby increase the risk sharing within and between communities.  While it may be difficult to reflect the\ncomplexity and likelihood of successful collaboration between communities, it may\nbe more realistic to include that feature in the game or to make that feature\neasier to use if it is indeed in the game.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game was to identify,\nassess, prepare, and cope with risk while undertaking health development in the\nworld of Alora. Therefore, I had to make some choices, one of which had to do with\nknowledge acquisition in the form of research. Research helped me recognized the\nchance of comet  hitting, the time it\nwould take me to either think about purchasing insurance or institute protective\nmeasures  until impact, and the severity\nof the pods that would be damaged by the comet. Interestingly, while it was a\ngood thing doing researching, I was slacking in health development as my\ndevelopment bar was neither being built nor upgraded.\n\nI played the game more than once. To be realistic, I\nhad no idea at all what to do initially. As the game started, I just sat there\nbehind my computer listening to the sound of music/water from the game, and\nbefore I realized it, the game was over. After the first game, I began experimenting\nwith the various buttons and sliders on the screen to understand their\nindividual functionalities. As I kept replaying the game, I was learning how to\nidentify the risk that was coming, and what I needed to do in order to minimize\nor avoid the effects of the falling comets. This knowledge/information helped\nme   avoid being damaged to some degree, but I was unable\nto balance between growing my Alora community and preparing for the risks of the\npotential falling comets. I also learned that I could quickly and cheaply\nrebuild pods damaged from the flooding by  \npurchasing insurance.\n\nIf I were tasked with developing a new version of\nthis game by proposing a change or adding one simple thing to capture some\naspects of risk management choices that matter where I live, I would add\ncounseling. Although knowledge, protection, insurance, preparation, and coping are\nall essentially strong risk management strategies, the role of counseling\nshould never be underestimated. When tornadoes hit our state, the psychological\nafter effects are unimaginable. Of course, there is insurance for people to\nrebuild their damaged homes. However, those individuals whose family members or\nloved ones died due to the tornadoes often have no professional provision of\nassistance and guidance in dealing with the psychological effects that come\nwith losing someone to disasters. Counseling would be a very effective strategy\nin risk management, and I would add it.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game was very interesting and thought-provoking. As the Luminator of Alora, the player's task is to develop this extra-terrestrial community and reach milestones in development while managing wealth and the development opportunities with the risk that Alora faces from falling comets. The player must plan ahead to manage the risks of comet strikes while also reaching the development goals in the timed rounds in order to proceed to the next levels. Since each comet strike can cause damage to existing developments, requiring time and money to make repairs, the Luminator is incentivized to research comets in preparation for strikes, protect the community to reduce the damage caused by comets, and buy insurance to help mitigate the damages that occur. Not only must the Luminator decide how to allocate Alora's financial resources (since money spent on preparing for comet strikes necessarily reduces the amount that can be spent on further development), but the Luminator must decide how much time can be spent on preparation at the expense of additional development.The game is further complicated by the choices the Luminator must make in developing the community. Each pod costs money to build, but every added pod also increases the rate of development. In addition to building pods, the Luminator can also make upgrades to existing pods. I had to play several times to get to level 4 and discovered that upgrading existing pods helped Alora reach its development goals more quickly than building additional pods. The more developed the pods, the more money was generated per pod.As I played, I realized that sometimes investing in development was more rewarding than protecting against risk. Being too preoccupied with preventing damage led to rounds in which I avoided all damage from comets but could not progress to the next level because Alora did not meet development goals. The balance that I found most successful involved prioritizing opportunity over risk, but I did always buy the best insurance possible and kept researching comets so I could anticipate major hits. If my development progress was good, I knew I could afford to spend time and resources on protection, but I invested in pod-building and upgrading first.While Risk Horizon takes many factors into consideration, it is still a simplification of the challenges that communities face in risk management. While economic consequences can be a great detriment to developing a community, I would argue that the psychological impact of community is crucial to development. After all, what is the point of a community without the common bond of its members? I like the community connections game and the fact that development drops when preventable damage occurs, but I think more is required. My suggestion for improving the game would be to add development rewards for successful prevention and community connections.",

            "reflection": "I found the\ngame a little confusing at the beginning. Did not quite understand where the\nrule of managing risks in a situation such as the game. I'm more accustomed to\ndirect discussions about the real problems in our world, such as economic\ncrises, natural disasters, in short, all the sudden changes that cause negative\nshocks across countries. \n\n I had some\ndifficulty coordinating set tools by clicking on the comets to increase my\nlevel of research, and the protection and safety measures that were available\nto ensure the sustainability of the planet.Comments on the oil sector in BrazilIn general, the government of underdeveloped or developing countries,\nas is the case of Brazil, has a strong\npresence in \"key\"\nsectors of the economy, such as the oil industry in order to make with its economic policies act by these companies.The freezing of prices of\npetrol and diesel Petrobras made\nby order of President\nDilma Rousseff, had\nthe objective of contain inflation, which is a consequence of the increase in prices of petrol and diesel in the international market. We can say that the higher consumption of oil and its derivatives in emerging economies (such as China, India, Brazil\nand others) and developed countries are\nresponsible for this.We can also observe that after\nthe financial crisis of 2008-2009, many countries adopted expansionary\nfiscal and monetary policies with\nthe objective of heating demand\nand avoid recession, among these\ncountries include Brazil, the United States and others. The automobile sector in Brazil, along with several other sectors, has obtained an\nincentive to reduce taxes.Another point that we should note, was the explosive growth of the middle class in Brazil,\nwhich boosted demand for both gasoline, diesel and other petroleum derivatives that are present in our entire economy.Petrobras has greatly increased the level of investment in exploration and production, yet in President Lula. In\n2006 arrived at achieve self-sufficiency in oil from Brazil, but this victory was subsequently suppressed by the strong\ngrowth in oil demand, a\nconsequence of the growing middle\nclass in Brazil which was also favored\nby government policies of the Lula government.With the discovery of pre-salt basin\nbetween 2006-2007, a great expectation arose from the federal government, by the size of oil reserves (about\n12 billion barrels of oil), and the complexity of oil extraction in high depth (about\n8,000 m below of the sea), a fact\nwhich undoubtedly increases the cost and\ntime of production in these\nregions, but did not appear as\nan impossible challenge, since Petrobras\nis a world leader in deep water exploration.The company has been conducting a\nhigh level of investment to\naccelerate oil production in\nthese regions, but there is a\nperiod of time for the investments\nto start give \"visible fruits\" in our economy.While oil demand is not fully supplied by\nPetrobras with the increased\nproduction of the pre-salt\nbasin, the government, through Petrobras, imported part of petrol and diesel in the international market at a higher price, and transferred\nin the internal market to a lower price with\nthe objective of  contain inflation,\nmaking an impoundment of market prices, until the growth\nof production in pre-salt basin can supply all\nthe demand in the country.I believe that with the growth of production in pre-salt basin,\nand subsequently, self sufficiency in oil in the Brazil, the Brazilian economy will be less vulnerable to price fluctuation caused by the import of\ngasoline and diesel.I also believe that the presence of the government in this sector will be crucial for the establishment\nof a stable economy, with economic growth and the use of the profits of\noil royalties being used in sectors like education, health and others. \nBut still, the new\ninvestments in renewable energy sources\nshould always continue in order to obtain energy\nalternatives that will reduce in\nthe long-term high demand for oil\nin the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

The role of the risk management was to create an adequate\ninfrastructure to deal with the impact of the natural calamity.\n\nThe choices in the game was to do the research on the\nmeteor, get insurance and make pods which will help protect the living population\nwhen the calamity strikes. The trade – off which was controlled by us was\ngetting an insurance. Building of pods was a time consuming process and the\nidea of the impact of the meteor could not be easily justified.\n\nThe knowledge was through the research regarding the meteor\nstriking and its impact, the protection was undertaken to build the pod and\nupgrade to various levels, the insurance was acting as the cushion for the\nrisk.\n\nThe preparation for the risk in terms of building pods was\nimportant and the impact after the calamity was over the recovery became the\nimmediate concern. It did stall the process of development but it was extremely\nimportant.\n\n I did play game more\nthan once, and there were different permutation and combinations were tried in\nterms of building pods, doing research and developing the area. The insurance\nwas utmost necessary and it was bought as soon as it was available. It speeded\nthe process of recovery.\n\nThe main things learnt from the game were that knowledge is\nimportant in order to plan and strategize, but the back up plan must also be\nready to deal with the impact of the natural calamity. \n\nThe game did capture some aspect of risk management, the one\nthing which I would change is the information available in terms of topography,\npods needed to be built time taken and once the level is not cleared the\nexplanation for the same.

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game? What\nchoices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of\nknowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk\naffect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\n\n\nThe role of risk management in this game is (1) to determine\nhow much money to put into development versus how much to put into protection\nand (2) to determine how much money to allocate between the various alternatives\nof protection, insurance and research. \nWhen faced with the threat, my first step was to provide the level of\nprotection to match the treat. Then purchase the medium level of insurance.\nHowever, as the development expanded, purchasing insurance became extremely\nexpensive, and I dropped to the minimum level. Having information on severity\nand probability of threat was extremely useful.  One of the learning was as the development grew the cost of\nproviding and insurance became extremely expensive. Preparation for the risk\nlimited the amount of money that could be put into development. But long term\nit is likely better to put some resources into preparation versus constantly\nrebuilding after a disaster.  This\nsimulation was somewhat unrealistic since the cost was in money and did not\ntake into account the loss of lives and disruption of people’s lives due to\ndisasters.This game did a very good job of presenting the trade-offs between doing development and risk mitigation preparation.\n\n\n\nIf you played the game more than once, what did you do\ndifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from\nthe game?\n\n\n\nI played the game several times.  After the first time, I changed my approach by continuing to\nspend on development but upgrading the preparation for a disaster – meteor\nhit.  At first I would purchased\ninsurance. But I then figure out that the information of probability of a\nmeteor hit and the severity was extremely important in determine the amount of\npreparation needed.  When there\nwere multiple meteors, I would quickly determine the worst case and prepare for\nthat case.  The hints that were\ngiven after the game were extremely helpfully. This would be similar to a\ncritique session that would be conducted after a disaster occurred.  The game was setup so that one could\nrespond fast to an incoming meteor. This is unlikely the case in the real world\nsince government and communities usually don’t act fast. \n\n\n\nOne of the main things that I learned from game was the\nvalue of having information about the impending disaster such as severity and\nprobability.  Information is critical\nin preparing for any risk.  \n\n\n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of\nrisk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the\ngame, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you\npropose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the\nplace you live? \n\nI would change the game to make the disaster mitigation\nopportunities through insurance and protection more realistic. The game allowed\none to purchase insurance and increase the protection after it was found out\nthat a dangerous meteor was heading for the development.  This is unrealistic since no one will\nsell you insurance when you are about to get hit by a meteor.  And the prevention alternative such as\nraising the level of the development takes time to implement. I would install some type of limitation on when you can buy insurance. I also would install a time lag on how fast the protection can be implemented.  This would make the importance of having information on potential disasters extremely important.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "The Risk Management in the game was trying manage the risk of the meteor hitting the community vs developing the community. I the game the choices that had to be made was around developing and growing the town (which is needed) and knowledge/ researching (which took time), taking insurance and Raising the city (Protection) which took Time and Money. However as I came to find that each impacted each other so all the activities had to be done together to ensure that I could move pass the level. At some points I chose to develop more or raise the city to its maximum as I thought that was best for the city at the point in time given the risks around. Preparing for the risks up front at the start of the game allowed continued Development as the city was not affect or was not affected as badly. It cost little to no money to recover from a disaster which meant that one could continue developing further and not spend the time and money repairing.I played the game multiple times, and generally I got further in the game each time. This happened as I learnt how to ensure I do all that was necessary to manage the risk. On my first try I was only concerned with developing which did not get me far. Then I was only concerned with the meteors that would do the most damage. So when there was a meteor that had a high severity and low change of impact I took all the time raising the city and in the end it missed. By the time I had reach level 6 of the game the main things I had really learnt was that in order to be successful one must be able to focus on multiple things at a time. You had to be aware of the meteors in the sky what the severity was and the chance of success. In addition you had forecast that if it hits it will lower your protection so your protection must be high enough to cover the one that is right be hind it cause you don't have time raise the protection or do more research. The importance of having your hands in different pots becomes very important on reflection in risk management.  Overall it was a great game and if I had to make any improvements so that it could better represent  the risk management choices that matter in the place I live I would try to make more human. The greatest risks where I lived are cause by humans mainly crime. So hindrance to development come from a more social aspect and not such a supernatural out of this world element. I think the natural disaster risks are important to manage but even in these they some times come down to the human risks. Imagine you build shelters but the food is stolen or destroyed. The greatest risk comes from Humans and that should be address in the game to make it even better. ",

It thought me how time should be managed. The game helps in making us realize that previous experiences help us better prepare for future risks and disasters. The game helps us think strategical and enhances our skill to handle risk in a more appropriate manner. The game helps us access risks and helps minimize, monitor and try and reduce the probability of risks during natural disasters.I played the game quite a few times to get a hang of it. The first game i just tried to increase the height of the platform of the site but later realized that by continuously trying to raise the platform decreased the building rate of the pods. In the next try i tried just tried to build the pods with out giving much attention to raising the platform. In the second attempt i also insured the buildings so that i don't end up paying an exorbitant amount of money to get the pods re-built and mend the damages. The risk of raising the platform was hampering my building speed and did not help in filling the bar to help me get through to the next level. I feel that i ended spending a lot of money on the insurance, if i had the chance to play the game again i would invest a little less in the insurance and take the odd risk in order to build more pods. Although I should say that studying the comet did not help me in any way, I must say i did not understand the concept of the glowing lights.",

            "reflection": "Lessons from the game: Communities are exposed to different shocks. Your environment, financial status, extent of knowledge of your environment and vulnerability to shocks and risks, institutional systems and structures and technical know-how with regards to risk management all determine the ability to prepare for the shocks, cope with the risks and harness opportunities therein. Knowledge of risk management not only prepares you for coming shocks but also ensures ability to cope with subsequent risks and develop resilience while still carnying out your day to day tasks as an individual, household, community or government.The importance of Research and Knowledge: Research is an essential part of risk management and should be the first step. It is important to learn early enough, what the problems are, the possible magnitude, as well as the possible avenues to tackle them. Adequate research ensures that you select the most appropriate coping strategies, technology and mechanisms at the most effective costs for each specific shock or risk. It also leads to pay-offs in terms of opportunities and guarantees resilience to a large extent. Research without appropriate action however is futile, expensive and time consuming. It must be followed by implementation of activities be it protection, appropriate insurance cover, information, reinforcements and savings.Role of risk management in the game? It played a vital role in the game because without putting some knowledge of risk management to play, you would simply loose. The activities in the game enabled me learn more about shocks, preparing ahead for the shocks based on the knowledge gained by protecting the community, insuring the against possible shocks, strengthening systems and structures through connections and enhancing the ability to cope effectively. Being able to do this generates much needed resources and savings that can be used to develop the community and further improve investments in development and build resilience to future shocks. It is more or less a delicate balancing act that requires assessment and reassessment of options and strategies as well as resources and taking appropriate actions while ensuring that development is not stagnated.Choices and trade-offs in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance: As portrayed by the game, research/Knowledge without protection or insurance is fatal. However, development requires time, resources management and knowledge of the terrain as well as insurance and savings in case you get hit. If you overstretch yourself in securing protection which is sadly not cheap, then you will be left open to future shocks with limited ability to cope. Too little knowledge on the other hand means that you will be caught unaware and be unable to prepare and protect the community, household or individual effectively. Insurance is also not cheap but it gives one an added confidence to pursue other development endeavours so that in the event of inevitable shocks, recovery becomes easier, coping is more effective and resilience is gradually developed. Knowledge therefore is essential but must be backed by protection and Insurance.Immediate and Long term effect of preparing for risks on development: Preparation for risks is expensive in the short term. It can also slow down development because there are less resources available. After some time however, it begins to pay off and the gains can be seen in improved coping, stronger resilience and development.Conclusions: To better achieve success in subsequent attempts of the game, I made sure to continue to develop and match protection to severity of shocks based on knowledge gathered through research. I wouldn't change much about the game except maybe to reduce the cost of protection and insurance for poorer communities. Finally, commitment towards success is rewarded.",

            "reflection": "1 - I think that one need to find a balance between the 3 aspects mentioned in this week videos. The knowledge is essential while preparing to a shock then, at the beginning I used it as the key factor to succeed but after all I've spent important money on that and I spent also a lot of time only observing the meteors. In the first 2 rounds I was only acting after shock but after a while it was clear that is much worth preparing immediately and do so you need to pay attention in the amount of money to spend with insurance.2 - I played 3 times and I planning on doing more to get a better grade and also to excel myself. I was so focus on getting information about the meteors that I did not buy any insurance in the first round. After that, I managed the insurance coverage with the information about the damage a meteor could do versus the quantity of pods I had. I could only improve my pods to the second stage though. The main message for me was 'balance'. Of course knowledge is very important as well as protection, you can't forget about insurance. It can save your money when coping after a shock.3 - I would add some after shock effects in the planet to make it more similar with a place that had been hit by a flooding. In places like that you can find a great quantity of dirty and cleaning that, if is not take care fast, it will contribute to create more damage if a second flooding hits the place. So I think this way one would have more experience in managing a risk before and coping after a shock.",

            "reflection": "In the game, I saw knowledge, insurance and protection as tools for risk\nmanagement that allowed the player to minimize the effects of the comets in their\nrate of development. This is a very good example of how external factors (risks)\ncan affect a community or group, be it countries, local groups or businesses. \n\nThe game was a great experience which allowed me to observe how different\nchoices affected the outcome of the game.\n\nBy increasing the city protection, we were attempting to minimize or even nullify\nthe effects of the external source. The effects of protection were more\nefficient as the protection levels increased to meet the potential of harm from\nthe external source (comets). However, their cost became significantly higher\nas the level of defense required to match the comets increased. Since the\ncontinuous development of the community (the pods in the game) also becomes\nmore expensive as time progresses, diverting resources for the improvement of\ndefenses above a certain level takes away resources that could be used for the\ndevelopment of the community. Also taking into account that the frequence in which\nevents are stronger than that level of defence happens, an adequate insurance\nplan would be sufficient to alleviate the problems caused by the external\nsource and assist in a quick and cheaper reconstruction of the community. This\nalso meant that the insurance was bought at a time when resources where not\ncompromised before the harmful event took place.\n\nThe use of knowledge is varied. Understanding the possible outcomes and probability\nof such an event helped planning the adequate amount of defenses required so\nthat resources are not wasted at the same time as defenses are strong enough. This\nincluded both the level of protection required and the amount of insurance\nrequired. Knowledge of the external factors also helps in facilitating the\nefforts for recovery after the incident has taken place.\n\nIt must be noted, however, that the objective of the game is not to develop\nyour community or to upgrade your defenses and insurance as fast as possible. Doing\none of this actions would take away resources for the development of the other.\nIn fact, the game emphasizes the need for a balanced development. This highlights\nthe importance of management of resources both at good and at bad times as the\ndevelopment and the repair of the pods, the cost of raising protection and acquiring\ninsurance became higher as the game progressed.\n\nWhile the lessons from the game can be easily translated to real life, it\nwas a great opportunity to experience managing these components in a simplified\nenvironment. I actually liked the fact that it was not immediately related to\nthe place where I live, which allowed me to detach myself from it and think\nmore strongly about the concepts we are learning. For this reason, I would not adapt\nthe game to fit my own circumstances. ",

            "reflection": "The Risk\nHorizon Game allows the player to experience risk management on a simple model.\nWhile building and developing pods you have to deal with the danger of colliding\ncomets, that can destroy your settlement. \nIt is possible to prepare for this danger by insuring pods, raising\nprotection or observing the comets. At the same time, these actions can be costly\nor slow down your development. \n\nThe most\neffective way of avoiding danger from the comets was rising protection, but it\nalso meant spending money and halting the development of the pods. By spending\ntoo much on it, you risked not completing the level in time. Insuring your pods\nwas costly and didn't offer protection from damage – it only lessened the costs\nof repairs. At the same time it didn't halt the building process. Observing the\ncomets was helpful when it came to dealing with the damage, but wasn't as\neffective as the other 2 options. In other words, the most effective way of\npreparing for risk (rising protection), was the most damaging in the long run\nby negatively affecting development. Observing the comets didn't cost anything, but could only lessen the damage. Insurance didn't protect from damage, it helped with coping with it. These two options didn't affect development in the long run, but where not as good with protecting form the imminent destruction.\n\nAfter\nplaying I several times I learnt to first focus on the development and only after\nthat on preparing for possible crises. If I spent too much time on protecting\nmy pods at the beginning, I wasn't able to complete the level on time. The\nsecond part of my strategy was balancing the observation of comets with a rising level of protection. I usually focused on this in the last minute of every\nlevel, when I was sure I would reach the development goal. I spent my leftover resources on rising of protection, which better prepared me for the next level. In addition, careful observation of the comets allowed me to maintain a high level of protection throughout the game. In this way, even if I received damage, it was minimal. When I balanced these 3 elements properly (development, protection and knowledge), I didn't have to spend money on insurance.\n\nThe one\nthing I would add, to make the game resemble real-life risk management, would\nbe a way to benefit from taking risks. For example, some of the comets could\nprovide additional income when they collided. Thanks to this improvement, every\nrisk could be a danger or an opportunity. The player would have to decide, if he is in a situation where he can risk a collision of a comet that could prove beneficial.",

            "reflection": "I found the riskhorizon game very enjoyable and useful. Addressing the questions, i emphasize the following:1. Risk management was the key to succeed. I reached level 6 following the above strategy: The first three levels, i focused on building and upgrading pods. The more i could the better. Research was the key point to succeed on avoiding damage, and of course to maintain the protection level according to the maximum meteor treat with severe chance to hit. From years 4 to 6, i focused on maintaining the protection level, to increase the research time, and i started buying a cheap insurance. On level 6, i bought the medium insurance plan, but never used it. I was never hit buy a meteor, thanks to research and protection level.2. If i played the game once, i would have bought from the beginning some insurance, losing valuable money from building/upgrading pods. I would also spent less time on research. Again i repeat that i think research and maintaining the correct protection level, were the key points. I conclude that almost everything we do has some cost, whether in time or resources. Appropriate risk management, which includes appropriate evaluation of the following danger, fast interaction with tthe world community, appropriate preparation are the key points to protect the community and develop. Definitely you must acquire some insurance, but you must evaluate appropriately, so not to expense excessively.3. If i was allowed to make one change, i would introduce the importance of institutions to the risk management, by adding a choise to construct and upgrade a \"Risk Management Institution\", which would reduce the damage made by meteors, but would be more expensive than building/upgrading pods.",

            "reflection": "The game\nshows how a decision maker in risk management has to perform in a very simple\nway.  You can learn how your decisions affects\nthe development. Sometimes you take decisions that are better than others at\nthe time you make them but in the long run they perform poor than others. In\nexplanation, you can spend money in the insurance and protection in a very\nearly stage, the risk will have a very low impact or none, but your development\nwill grow less and in the long run you are not going to have develop enough. Making\ndecisions always comes with a trade-off, you have to aim for the perfect.\n\nAt the first\ntime I played the game, I was playing very conservative. I was taking the 75%\ninsurance as soon as possible. Also was maxing protection more than I should.\nMy development was suffering because of this and at the end I was not able to\nmake it in the final levels. I have learnt that playing very conservative,\nmaxing protection and insurance from the very beginning, comes with a trade-off,\npoor investment. But develop my buildings with minimal protection and a low\ninsurance was not performing better. At the end I have learnt that you have to\ntake enough knowledge to reduce the needed cost of protection and insurance to\nbe able to invest more effective.\n\nIn the\ncurrent implementation of the game I feel that the community is not very well\nrepresented. Right now the community support is based on how quick you can click\nat the right area in your screen. I think this is not a good representation. Community\nsupport not relies on how quick communities can interconnect between them but\nalso how strong are the links, how big are this communities, how prepared are\nthem for the kind of risk, etc. Definitely, this is something I would change.In relation\nwith the changes to represent better the risk management choices that matter in\nthe place I live, I think that the current game already represents the different\naspects of risk management like knowledge, investment, protection and\nmitigation. Is true that I have little knowledge about how risk management is\nperformed in my area, but thanks to this course I’m starting to learn a lot\nabout it. Then, in the future I might change my mind about this.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a critical role in the game. Throughout the game there was the ever-present threat of meteors threatening your development pods. These were ranked differently and each showed different levels of risk to the pods. However, their potential impact on your development was devastating. As such, insurance played a key role in success. When I began playing the game, I initially was very hesitant to develop the pods. I overvalued the risk of the meteors based on the lack of data I had on them. I began playing without looking at the tutorials and simply dove straight in. I didn't know the meteors had different rankings, and I had no idea of the relative impact they could cause. I also had no idea there was so much of a push for development of the pods. As such, I played it in a relaxed, weary manner. I did not opt to develop out of fear, a fear that was in the end unfounded.On the second occasion, I played the game after going over the tutorials. This was a much smarter option and gave me a much better understanding of the relative risks of the different meteors, as well as the potential value in development. This encouraged me to develop fast. I built many pods and tried to develop on the ones I had. However this was also based on uninformed benefits of fewer developed pods as opposed to many undeveloped pods. I then purchased insurance covering 75 per cent of my losses. This proved vital as I was hit a number of times after I initially established my pods. I am not sure whether it was absolutely necessary to cover for 50% of the losses as opposed to 75% of the losses, but this is what I felt was best to do. It would be interesting to see whether this was an unnecessary cost or not.However, considering the number of meteors that hit, it seemed that the insurance was very effective. In the second level I only purchased 50% insurance as I was more rapidly expanding my development. This however cost me a lot as I was hit multiple times by meteors and the impacts seemed to increase with time in the game. This taught me the value of insurance. But it also taught me the vulnerabilities of developed pods which were extremely costly to repair. However, due to the number of investments, monetary flows were maintained and minimal repairs were made.If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to add interconnectivity between the pods. It seemed that the impacts on one pod did not affect the other pods, nor the cost of repairs or the revenue intake. As such, one could simply maintain a few pods while the others were still damaged and returns were no different. In my life, it seems that impacts are much more interconnected, and as the impacts of disaster increase, so too do the costs of repairs across the system as opposed to isolated damages and repairs.",

            "reflection": "   I think that primary message of this game is to show that everything costs time and money. So you must invest in research, protection and insurance and balance those to minimize costs in order to achieve some confidence that risk effect will have a low impact.    Another point is about time. This game also point that time is going so if you loose the opportunity and do not make a right decision at right time the risk impact will grow exponentially.     To summarize this game outlines three subjects which you have to deal with in risk management: Resources (money)TimeBalance between Development, Research, Protection, Insurance and TimeResources.Another question is about play this game once and play it again. What do I would do differently?It depends if the second time will be identically as first time I mean that the same meteors will hit the same place so everything will be repeated. In this way will know how things will evolve and choose the best strategy in order to meet the game objective.But in real life the things happens differently with a random probability. And we are not able to predict or know in advance what will happen.  Also during this game you can find that early investigation in risk preparation have a big impact on development. So you should assume a risk tolerance threshold and start invest into risk preparation after reach this threshold. In this way you'll have some money in order to keep or raise development.  So if I will be tasked to develop a new game version I'll add a new parameter risk tolerance. For sure it will introduce some complexity into game but it will describe better how we deal with project management in real life. Also the game didn't reveal the abstraction or the root cause of the problem in risk management. It doesn't show that we try with finite characteristics timemoney to solve or control infinite sets of factors which affect or have an impact on Development and Risk management.As a result of this game or knowledge that can be applied in real life in my environment or place where I live, I want to emphasize the following:   We always can find a way to deal with effects of undesirable phenomenons. Just make the right decisions at the right time and do not loose the opportunities.   ",

            "reflection": "How the Sky enlightened me…\nwith a Big Bang!\n\nPlaying the game offered in\nthis course was a struggle first to understand the rules of the game. Which in\nitself can be seen as a learning process, developing knowledge of risks in the\ngame and how to handle them. Making a tradeoff between spending time on this\ngame, and other obligations in my life.\n\nWithin the game I first tried\nto research the objective of the game, earning points within the limited time\nframe: building and upgrading as many structures as soon as possible. Soon I\nfound out “living” this game this way, did not help, while I suffered from the\nattacks from the sky. On the other hand, trying to protect myself as much as\npossible, did not help too, while the game was over before I reached the next objective\nlevel.\n\nIn my opinion, within this\ngame, the insurance policy did not really help me. Facing a high impact risk I\nshould manage by myself (with increase of protection level on time), or when\nthat seemed impossible, by researching enough to gain time to improve\nprotection after impact. I learned about this last possibility only after some\ntime. \n\nWhen a new risk appeared I imagined\nI could not handle, doing research was a better way to solve the situation on\nthe short term. However this protection gained after impact was not\nsustainable. So I preferred preparing myself for any situation by investing in\nprotection on forehand. Therefor when there were no immediate threats, I spend\nmoney on increasing protection to get a ´safety level´.\n\nBased on this I soon made up\nmy strategy:\n\nSpend enough money on\nbuilding structures to work on my goal, but leave some safety margin on resources\nfor protection.Have a quick first assessment\nof all new “risks” entering the sky, to decide the size of (possible) impact and\nthe chance this will occur.Based on this first\nknowledge decide how to face the situation: no action needed (while risk is low\nor I think I can handle the effect), or action is needed, either by researching\nmore or to increase protection level.But in the meantime, building and\nupgrading new structures were essential to gain enough resources and get to the\nnext level of the game. During the different times I played the game, I never\nsucceeded to get to the next level, when some of the buildings were damaged.\n\nThis gave me the very unconformable\nidea if this is also true for real life situations, people who are confronted\nwith some life threatening event, they cannot overcome without help themselves.\nWhen their houses are damaged, or other basic needs to survive, they probably\nhave not enough ´energy´ (or other resources) left to be able to survive new\nrisks. And that is not a game…\n\nLiving in Western Europe\nmyself, I feel very luckily to face less life threatening risks due to natural\ndisasters like some other parts of the world. I think for my part of the world,\nit can be interesting to play this game with the possibility to adjust the\nvelocity and impact of threats coming from the sky. Coping with a tradeoff between\nthe risk level you are accepting to take and the benefits you can gain when you\naccept more risk. Feeling ‘totally safe’ is probably a state of happiness, but\none should not fall asleep, not aware of the impact of a risk which can happen\nanyway….\n\n ",

The players objective\nwas to minimise my exposure to risk while maximising my opportunity to develop\nthe community. You had to weigh up insurance, education of meteorites,\nbuilding, available funds, repairs, and raising the land levels.\n\nI found the best way for me to reach level 4 was principally\nthrough protection- tacking appropriate action to raise the land level. It took\nme several goes to find that the best way. what I thought was the most straight\nforward was not the way I eventually found worked\n\nI learned to read the meteorites and then take appropriate action\nin raising the floor level of the village. It was time consuming and did cost\nsome money but I found it to be the best strategy,\n\nI also learnt that I couldn’t just focus on completing one building\nat a time and I had to put my money on building many structures as I could. I\nstarted off building and extending just a couple of houses at the time but the\ngame required me to spread my money around. \n\nI also found insurance was important and I took it out each\ntime. I never took out full coverage but I did spread the risk around \n\nThe game was an evolution in strategy. I learnt that it was\na process of seeing what was working and what wasn’t.  I learned that I was dealing the immediate\nthreats and had to change strategy to tackle more preventative measures like\nsea levels. \n\nThe main things I learnt from the game was to try something\nout and make adjustments. \n\nI learnt insurance and education were important but not as important\nas adjusting the floor level of the area. If I had the floor level at the right\nheight then I actually didn’t need insurance but I still took some out just in\ncase\n\nI might if I wanted to look at loss of life as a result of\nthe activity. So each time a meteorite hit, it might impact population level\nand time and money to bury the dead. \n\nOne of the best challenges that we have here in Australia is\nthe bureaucracy and the time it takes for things to happen.  Otherwise we are very good at risk management\n  ",

            "reflection": "1. First of all, I whould like to say, that the Risk Horizon game, is interesting and quite enjoying. I really liked it. But at the same time I do not understand much about it at all. It takes me several hours to get to some desent level (like 4th, or 5th). I am not sure how is this working. The game is all about the risk management and your decisions and chances, which we can not control. I have tried to stay in the middle - to continue developing the planet and do a lot of researches. When the hit probability was really high I bought some insurance. But money is still not enough. There was not good explanation of how to play this game, or what should we do in the beginning. And the game was not properly working on my PC. Preparation for risk sometimes comes affect development and sometimes simultaniously. I was not figure it out. I was constantly switching, so I am not sure.2. I have played the Risk Horizon game not only once. As I mentioned above, I have waisted several hours trying so hard to succeed. I was trying to do different techniques - like to build only one house, and developing just it. But it was not working. Than I switched , and decided to build all of the buildings, and than developing them. And always taking into account the possibility of risk. I still do not know how to balance in this game. I learned that everything is unstable, and sometimes it is not in your hands to control everything. Moreover, you should be ok with the results you have had. Learn from your mistakes and go on. Risks is a must, but most of the time it is not worthy the actions . Sometimes you win, sometimes you do not. It depends. (your luck or your constant actions - still have not decided yet).3. In this game I would add a manual. I I do not really get this game at all. What was I doing was baised on my observation and from my mistakes in the game. I have not seen the connection between the risk managing and the game. I was paying insurance, developing the houses and doing a lot of research and did not find the answer. The risk happenned either way, no matter what was I doing or not doing. ",

            "reflection": "Overall assessment - Risk management is predominantly an optimization problem. The variables are Knowledge of opportunities or risks, Protection mechanisms and Insurance (Coping mechanisms). The higher the risk the higher the investment in the coping mechanisms and gaining knowledge of the situation (issue) to maximize resources for damage control and a speedy recovery and vice versa. There is no perfect solution possible, only optimal strategies.From the game perspective the following scenarios emerge -a. High severity of the comet hitting and a high chance of that event happeningIf the\n  comet is moving slower there is more time to research and adjust the\n  parameters - this is indicative of having more time to focus on preparation\n  and coping with an inevitable disaster\n    Focus on coping and protection - increase research for minimizing impact by\n  getting more time to deal with the aftermath, maximize insurance for faster\n  recovery.\n    If the comet is moving faster maximize insurance and increase research\n  commensurate with that speed. Divide resources to also increase pod building\n  (lower levels) to maximize resources for damage control\nThe\n  focus here (given the inevitability of the result) is on faster recovery and\n  minimizing damage to community outreach, research and building coping\n  mechanisms\nb. Medium severity of the comet hitting and a Medium chance of that event happeningIf the\n  comet is moving slower there is more time to research and adjust the\n  parameters. \n    Focus on coping - increase research to match the chance of the hit,\n  increase insurance commensurate with the developing threat. \n    If the comet is moving faster maximize insurance, increase research but\n  stay focused on increasing pod growth activity\nThe\n  focus here is on having a balanced\n  use of resources between opportunity versus minimizing damage to community\n  outreach, research and building coping mechanisms\nc. Low severity of the comet hitting and a Low chance of that event happeningFocus more on pod growth to increase opportunity and resources. Get adequate insurance and also match protection with chance of hit to deal adequately if the hit happens. Match research to the chance of the hit keeping in mind the severity. If there is time (comet moving slowly) then poll the threat frequently to adjust insurance adequate to the severity of the threadThe strategy here is to focus pre-dominantly on the growth opportunities with some protection and basic coping mechanism through adequate researchd. Low severity of the comet hitting and a high chance of that event happeningFocus more on pod growth to increase opportunity and resources. Get adequate insurance and also match protection with chance of hit to deal adequately if the hit happens. Match research to the chance of the hit keeping in mind the severity. If there is time (comet moving slowly) then poll the threat frequently to adjust insurance adequate to the severity of the thread Focus pre-dominantly on the growth opportunities with some protection and basic coping mechanism through adequate research. Coping is less of an issue over protectione. High severity of the comet hitting and a low chance of that event happeningFocus more on pod growth as there is a diminished chance of disaster and as there is more time to research the threat and preparation - increase research commensurate with the chance of a hit, increase insurance commensurate with the severity of the threat. Also focus on increasing opportunity by building pods or enhancing them so more is available to repair pods when the eventual hit happens for better damage controlThe focus here is to remain aware of the threat through research, building adequate protection but having more resources for growth",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game is based in some decisions we need to take in several ways:1 – The probability of an accident;2 – The insurance we take;3 – The protection we have.For all these issues we need to combine the development with the prevention and preparation for the disasters. We need to have money to combine these two crucial issues. The 3 factors (prevention, preparation and money) are the major keys to success in the development.I played the game 3 times and all the times I had different strategies.  I learned what I referred above. We need money to develop but also we need a good prevention to prevent damages like insurance with 75% of protection and watch the probability of disaster. In the last game I played I developed faster and the goals went rapidly in the target.After played the game the improvement I suggest is to make some input like temperature or flood because can be other variable to make more complex the game in the last level.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game really helped to draw out the concepts of the lessons this week. Gamers have to learn to balance risk and choose the rate of development. The comets were coming at a great pace, but in order to move to the next level you need to integrate knowledge, insurance, and protection to move forward. The power of knowledge was readily apparent when tracking the comets. As a gamer, you are forced to access the severity of the risk of the comet as well as likelihood of impact. Those factors weighed heavily since you only had so much to invest in development or purchasing insurance. A misallocation of resources could quickly sent a player back from the goal of reaching the next level. Interpreting the research accurately is the power of knowledge. Although, as a gamer, I felt I understood what the likelihood and severity meant. After, playing a few rounds, I could start to get better at knowing when to hold off on buying insurance and instead invest in development. Understanding what information was being provided and then being able to act on it in timely matter is central to the game and to application of risk management in development.As in risk management, there were different forms of insurance that could be used to mitigate the potential cost of a comet strike. At first, I would always buy the insurance with the highest premium. However, after a couple of rounds, I could see that buying the most expensive insurance didn't necessarily guarantee success. You need to allocate just the right amount to get the desired result.The direct correlation to insurance in development is readily apparent. If you are buying insurance to guard against a lost of crops, for instance, but don't have enough money left to plant more it is self defeating. Another example would be, is if the likelihood and severity of bad outcome is minimal then reducing your insurance payment could be used to plant more. The trade-offs have to be dealt with and then assigned the proper weight to determine how much insurance to buy. The role of protection in the game could have been more straight forward. Although, the elements of insurance and knowledge are very explicit. It took me a couple of rounds playing to realize, I was making the protection decisions perhaps I should have thought of this anyway. However, to someone that doesn't read all the directions, like me, it was apparent the slider actually raised a lowered the island. Overall, the game was fun and learned to see the concept of risk management in different setting that will help through the rest of the course. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game is likable to the type that is found in an organizational setting in their day to day operations.The uncertain economic times of the past few years have had a major effect on how companies operate these days. Companies that used to operate smoothly with the help of forecasts and projections now refrain from making business judgements that are set in stone. Now, companies have a renewed focus: to manage risk.\n\nRisk is the main cause of uncertainty in any organisation. Thus, companies increasingly focus more on identifying risks and managing them before they even affect the business. The ability to manage risk will help companies act more confidently on future business decisions. Their knowledge of the risks they are facing will give them various options on how to deal with potential problems.\n\nRisk can come from both internal and external sources. The external risks are those that are not in direct control of the management. These include political issues, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. Internal risks, on the other hand, include non-compliance or information breaches, among several others.\n\nRisk management is important in an organisation because without it, a firm cannot possibly define its objectives for the future. If a company defines objectives without taking the risks into consideration, chances are that they will lose direction once any of these risks hit home.\n\nIn recent years, many companies have added risk management departments to their team. The role of this team is to identify risks, come up with strategies to guard against these risks, to execute these strategies, and to motivate all members of the company to cooperate in these strategies. Larger organizations generally face more risks, so their risk management strategies also need to be more sophisticated. Also, the risk management team is responsible for assessing each risk and determining which of them are critical for the business. \n\nThe critical risks are those that could have an adverse impact on the business; these should then be given importance and should be prioritized. The whole goal of risk management is to make sure that the company only takes the risks that will help it achieve its primary objectives while keeping all other risks under control. \n\nIf I were to play this game again, I will approach it more cautiously taking into cognizance those experiences that I have garnered from my first attempt. Organizations face internal and external actors and influences that make it uncertain whether, when, and the extent to which they will achieve or exceed their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on the organisation’s objectives is risk.\n\nAs president and owner of Heuer Insurance Company in Sparks, Larry Heuer is well aware of the catastrophic losses businesses have the potential to experience if they don’t practice appropriate risk management. As an example of sound risk management, however, he chooses to remember a client who suffered a large loss due to a fire caused by a tenant in one of his upscale apartment complexes. “This was a very bad claim, but the client had the right amount of coverage,”1 Heuer explains.\n\n Having the right amount of coverage meant that the client avoided having to reach into his own pocket to pay for tens of thousands of dollars for the extensive damage to his property. “The purpose of insurance is putting you in the same position after the loss as before,”2 Heuer says.\n\n1:The importance of risk management in business,www.nevadabusiness.com/.../risk-management-a-necessary-consideration.,br\n2:ibid.\n\n\n",

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Answer 1: The role of risk management in the\ngame was to prepare for the losses due to risk of comet and meteor hitting, to\nmake use of insurance intelligently to minimize the damages, and to invest in\nadequate research. For low chances of hit and low severity, I invested more in\nresearch. For high chances of hit, or high severity, I tried to invest in\nmoderate insurance. For both high chances of hit and high severity, I invested\nin buying highest insurance. When, I bought highest insurance protection, the\nredevelopment costs were low in the event of a comet or meteor strike.Question 2: If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?Answer 2: Given that I played the game more\nthan once, my main learning from the game was:\n\n1.   \nInvestment in insurance helps in\nmanaging the damages due to risk.\n\n2.   \nCommunity protection helps in\nminimizing the losses due to risks.3.   Adequate investment in research helps in correctly evaluating the chances of risk event happening.Question 3: The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Answer 3: I would want to enable a feature that allows decision making\non the basis of changing risk-aversion of an individual: whether low, moderate\nor high risk aversion depending on the severity and chances of hit. ",

I find this game very useful, because it showed me how important key components of risk - knowledge, protection, insurance, coping are.   In the game we had three main tools to use to manage risk - research, the power of protection and insurance. Research - when we notice a comet via research we were able to see the chance ot the comet hitting, and the severity of the comet. Knowing this information we could click the certain comet and elongate the time we have for community connections and thus boost our protection.Protection - In the game we had a button which we pressed to make equal comet severity and our level of protection and to protect from damage our pods. This costed us money so we were not able to press it to maximum protection.Insurance - we could use this tool to lower the costs when repairing the damaged pods. Having limited resources (money) we could not have maximum protection all the time so the knowledge and research were very important to make our decisions. Every level was more difficult than the previous one - it had more comets and we had to think and act faster. The game helped me understand the importance of every phase - before, during and after the disaster and also to realize how difficult is to observe all the time the chance of disaster and to continue developing - building and upgrading pods at the same time. ",

            "reflection": "I have played the Risk Horizon game, and now I will address the three questions asked. I will start with the first question, regarding the role of risk management in the game. To do this, I will first provide a short description of the game. The game consists on an area where the player can build a limited number of pods that will become a community. Those pods are the wealth pools, the goal is to reach a certain amount of wealth. Comets can sometimes be seen in the sky, and if they hit, they can cause damage to the community, they reduce wealth and the damage has to be repaired, which also costs. The game has some tools, like an insurance, that can cover part of the damage, and also prevention that can meet the predicted severity of the impact. As for the meteors themselves, once they can be seem, you can check how sever its impact can be and how likely it is to hit. If a comet hits, you have sometime, limited by how much you researched the comet, to build links between individual members of the community, and these reduce the damage level. I will now address the role of risk management in the game. The role of risk management in the game involves having the right information about the comet, investing in the protection and insurance, but also on the size of the community, since more links between individuals lead to less damage. But also having a minimum amount of money to effect the repairs. It also involves upgrading the pods, to have more wealth. I decided to have insurance from the beginning, started with a small number of pods that I upgraded to higher levels and then built more pods, and always met the severity of the comet before impact.Now as to what I learned from the game, it seems I did not learn much, but it was a chance to see whether I had fully understood the concepts taught in this course. I played the game twice and I would not have changed anything if I were to play again.If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would had different types of risk, so different types of comets and I would try that the management also involves different levels according to the risk that is being faced.",

As a player, I was supposed to get prepared for disasters caused by meteors by increasing my knowledge about them. I noticed that meteors caused lower damages in cases where I made adequate researches. Because their severity level was reducing in that cases. However, I could not do anything to reduce severity as the chances of hit was so high that there was nothing I could do by increasing my knowledge. In that cases, the more appropriate instrument was insurance which help me recover my damages quickly. Another point I liked about the game was the chance and resource factors that were embedded to the game quite successfully. My money was saving by time and I had to make good choices to use my resources effectively and appropriately.   ",

            "reflection": "This risk management game simulates decision making processes where one cannot have all of the ideal conditions or be able to pick all of the wisest decisions in unison. Difficult choices must be made, with both intended and unintended consequences. The game was educational and fun to play, and I played to date 4 times. Discussed below are the manners in which I did play the game and how the strategy changed over time with the new consequences highlighted.When I first began playing the Risk Horizon game, I did not purchase any insurance just to see if it were possible to build as many pods as possible and then begin to upgrade afterwards. I also clustered the pods close together. These aforementioned measures, were both examples was a poor strategy indeed and it resulted in my losing level 2. The next time I played I still did not purchase insurance but I did focus only on building a few pods and then I worried about upgrading as fast as I could to increase earnings from property values. This aforementioned strategy also resulted in me losing level 2. It was not until I purchased insurance (the most expensive but most comprehensive kind) and I focused on building a median amount of pods quite distant from each other, with a focus on upgrading did I make it to level 3. The addition of insurance seems to be the independent variable necessary, where rebuilding was subsidized and recouping losses was more manageable. I saw a number of opportunity costs, which according to Investopedia (2014) means, and I quote: \"The cost of an alternative that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain action. Put another way, the benefits you could have received by taking an alternative action.\" In other words, when I spent more money on insurance and upgrading pods, I could not build as many, or when I built more pods I could not repair as many. Also, in accordance with the course lectures and game description I had diminishing returns, where, as the levels progressed, and pods were fixed, formerly, the associated costs went up and my money lost value over time for repairs to be made.I learned then that insurance is a necessity.If I were to assist in upgrading the game and making it more realistic, I would add pixel augmentation (improve pix-elation for better graphics) and related techniques to make the game more real life and convincing. I would also add a more sophisticated algorithm able to give more detailed and sophisticated instructions so that the game would adapt to individual players and provide more complex, real world challenges. I would add risk from flooding from the water as one example.  Still, I found the game already a challenge, as of yet, I have not moved beyond level 3.References Investopedia (2014) Opportunity Cost.

            "reflection": " The game is about a world in development, constantly being \"bombarded\" with meteors. It simulates risk management against systemic risks. In the game your goal is to reach a certain level of development while managing the constant overhanging danger of meteors potentially crashing into the planet. To increase you development level you have to spend funds, which you acquire over time (based on your development level). Managing the risk of crashing meteors are split in three: Knowledge, protection and insurance, and are represented by: Studying the meteors by selecting it, and therefor more accurately explaining the risk it poses. Using funds to raise your \"city\" on a hill, protecting it from waves caused by a meteor. And lastly insurance which gives you back 33, 50 or 75% of the damage, regarding what insurance level you buy.I used these three methods in the following way: Protection, to see what kind of threat the meteor posed. Knowledge was the base of my risk management and I acted out from what knowledge I was able do deduct from the meteors. Also knowledge seemed to give a \"double\" benefit in the game, as it both gave you a better idea of how the meteor was going to affect you, and it gave you more time to mobilize the community. After acquiring knowledge, i went to protection. If i could up my protection was within a certain range of what power the meteor could be hitting with, I would up my protection to counter the meteor impact. Lastly i used Insurance as a last backup. If i had problems getting my protection up to the level needed, or there were too many meteor at one time to manage. The fourth thing, not focused on in the game or tutorial, but which i noticed while playing was always keeping a bit of capital at hand. If you always spent your last funds on upgrading pods, then I had no money left for restoration for the the shit hit the fan. This seemed to be another aspect of knowledge which the game does not specify, but is significant when playing. My first time trying the game I lost at level 1. I think this is because I had to experience how the game managed, and how the different things worked and affected gameplay. Afterwards I thought of it as yet another part of knowledge needed to play the game properly. The next try, I made it all the way to level 4. So with added knowledge, I could quickly address the risks.If I were to redevelop the game, I would add a focus, or a little reminder after you have played to make sure that people playing it also noticed that knowledge about saving funds and understanding after experience also aided you in beating the game. So knowledge should really be the baseline for all risk assessment. I think in the place that I live. Using  knowledge and experience to determine risks and handling these risks (and unforeseen ones) is underestimated. The ability to make a buffer part of your risk assessment is very important in my view.",

            "reflection": "1.      I had a difficult time balancing risk managment and development.  For example, I found it difficult to develop enough cash to buy the insurance I needed when I saw a comet coming.  I noticed that the insurance I needed was often a very few dollars more than I had.  I tried waiting to purchase the insurance, but the money count did not add upwards as I waited.  I also found it difficult to raise the land, which is the solution for long-term safety.  I did notice that repairs were quick and inexpensive after buying insurance.  If I could see the whole screen again, I would be very slow to raise the island in the early stages.  Trying to raise the island early in the game cost a lot of money and seemed to turn the left bar red.  I would also spend more time researching the comets.  Additionally, I would save more money for insurance when the most severe comets with the higher levels of certainty to impact were coming.  In summary, it was hard to balance development with knowledge, protection and insurance.  Protection came from raising the island level and also researching the comets enough to have time for community action after the impacts.  The knowledge gained from researching the comet helped decrease the damage and the insurance protection made the damage decrease or at least it made rebuilding after damage less expensive and more rapid.2.  I played the game many, many times.  I played at least 20 times.  I found that it was important to do all the elements simultaneously.  It was important to use the research, insurance, and raising the level while also trying to develop enough to have sufficient cash to afford the protection efforts.3.  I had a lot of technical trouble seeing the game.  I experienced a ton of difficulty seeing the top and bottom of the screen.  Many times this made it impossible to see the comets until they were almost landing and I could not see the cash balance or the insurance information.  In all, the technical difficulty made the \"game\" extremely frustrating.  I suggest adding some diagnostics to see if the student's computer has the appropriate resolution and sizing while loading the game.   I also suspect that the best thing for long-term development, raising the island, was too expensive early in the game.  Raising the island (protection) made the bar on the left side drop from a high level of green to a low level and red.  Also, there were many times when the insurance would not respond to my selection.  This took valauble time and prevented other efforts while trying to purchase insurance.If I would suggest one simple change, it would be to give the price of raising the island more clearly.  I could not find out the cost of raising the island by a bar or half a bar, etc.  That would have made the choice of when to attempt raising the island more clear.   I would often try to raise the island in the last seconds before impact because it was the only action I could take quickly.  Then it would change the cash balance.  It seemed like the income and the expenses would change quickly, but I could not figure why the income was increasing and decreasing quickly in the last moments.  ",

            "reflection": "The risk management role in the game, Risk Horizon, is to minimize the adverse affects of a risk, which is the collision of comets on an island, and the consequent damage to the pods that have been built on the island.   \n\nThe game provides the player a sum of money to build the pods.  Each pod has a cost to build, and as these pods are built, the initial sum is reduced by the cost of the built pod.  While pod building, comets appear in the sky, headed for the island.  To win the game, the player needs to build pods to a designated value and protect the built pods from losing value below this needed value. Pod value is reduced by damage done by colliding comets.  The player has 2 and 1/2 minutes to achieve the need value.\n\nEach comet, as it appears in the sky, has knowledge associated with it.  This knowledge includes the damage severity to the pods if the comet collides with the island and the chance of comet collision.  The player needs to use this knowledge to decide on options the player has to minimize the damage that a collided comet will have on the built pods.\n\nThe options to minimize the damage to the pods from the comets are to obtain protection and/or to obtain insurance.  The player can obtain protection, but to do so requires time.  Time is important because the game lasts only 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Obtaining protection requires substantial time that could otherwise be used to build pods.   In order to win the game, the total value of the pods built needs to reach a designated level within the 2 and 1/2 minutes.\n\nHowever, increasing the pod-built total value takes time.  So, there is a time-used tradeoff between building pods and obtaining protection.  Obtaining too much protection might mean not leave enough time building pods to reach the required pod-built value.  Not enough time building protection increases the potential damage to the built pods when a comet collides with the island.\n\nThe knowledge provided to the player on each comet is crucial in deciding how much protection should be obtained. The knowledge includes the damage severity on the built pods if the comet hits the island and the chance of island collision by the comet.  This knowledge is a guide to the player on how much time to build up protection – the higher the severity and the collision chance – the more protection (and time) needed.\n\nShould a collision seem likely, and if the player believes that protection may be insufficient to minimize the pod damage on collision, the player can buy insurance, using up some of the funds and time otherwise needed to build pods.  The purchased insurance, however, will reduce the severity of the pod damage from the colliding comet and protect some of the value of the pods.\n\nThe strategy I would use, and eventually did use, after playing the game initially, would be to obtain sufficient protection where comets with high damage severity and collision chance appear.  \n\nA key point learned is to quickly obtain knowledge on each comet and to be concerned about those comets that have high severity damage and collision chance.\n\nIn a new version of the game, I would put more emphasis on being able to reduce the chance of collision as I acquired more knowledge about the risk (the comet).  This new aspect to the game models well actual conditions where more knowledge often helps prevent the risk (the collision) from taking place.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1) The role of risk management was to effectively protect and develop the pods to higher levels by utilizing the available resources efficiently to balance research, protection and insurance levels without affecting the growth. Some of the choices that I made are performing more research and increasing the knowledge about the meteors(risk) so that there is enough time to increase the community support and thereby increasing the protection without actually buying protection which saved resources and thereby helped in faster development, increasing knowledge and protection to neutralize the damage which saved insurance money, buying insurances when there was not enough time to research or not enough resources to buy protection there by reducing the damage, spending more time on researching risks with higher severity and chances of hit ranks sometimes lead to wastage of research time since the meteors didn't hit at the end and not doing enough research on low chances of hit meteors lead to damage since those meteors end up hitting at the end. The trade-offs that I confronted are whether to spend the resources to increase the protection level and have little or no insurance or try to increase the insurance and depend on research to increase protection which will save resources upfront that will help faster development and insurance will decrease the damage, whether to research a short-term risk with lower severity and higher chances of hit or to research a long-term risk with high severity and low chance of hit etc. whether to always maintain a higher protection level by spending more resources to avoid risk totally or to prepare for effective post risk situation through insurance for reducing the damage and getting back to development quickly by letting the risk to hit or happen. Buying maximum protection and insurance upfront without exactly knowing the severity of the risk and lead to wastage of resources in the initial stage that effected development. Too much of focus on risk avoidance might also be wasteful if the risk didn't happen. Having maximum insurance without proper protection also increased damages. Since, development has to happen within the specified time limit spending too much resource with out proper research and knowledge of how to handle each risk affected the development. 2) I played the many times and every time I learned something new and changed my strategies every time. There is always room for improving or perfecting risk management techniques. First time I didn't have complete knowledge about the game then I didn't focus on the development level and time limit then I spent a lot on increasing the protection and having maximum insurance to mitigate risk but failed to develop then I had maximum insurance and did research but failed to have good protection etc., After many iteration I was able to find an optimal solution that had a good balance of growth, knowledge, protection and insurance.I learnt that all the elements of risk management are equally important and above all development is more important than just risk management alone. First thing that is needed is enough knowledge about the risk and how to mitigate the risk. I also learnt that there are situations that are so uncertain that it is difficult to fully prepare for it but it is necessary to learn from the previous experiences and try to reduce the damage so the recovery can be made easier.3) I think the game has already covered all the aspects of risk management choices in my place and I don't think there is anything that I would want to change.",

            "reflection": "1a. In the Risk game online, Risk Management played the role of helping detect and plan for the inevitable event of a meteor disaster, which consistently bombards the island. Likewise, progressive preparations and by solidifying the pods based on the level of impact, Research and Protection; which are the decisions necessary to help keep the pods from utmost destruction after the meteor hits and shock wave released. Risk Management also helped me in making important decisions like which pods receives more attention after the damage is done.I learnt that Risk management will help weather the storm of eventualities and keep my investment in progress instead of spending resources on repairing damages, I am able to spend in expanding my investments portfolio and build wealth easily and not trying to start from scratch due to careless research results or inaccurate assessment evauation of my Risks.   b. I made the choices of start building pods far from the edge of island instead of at the coastal fronts.  I also made sure after building pods close to the shores or edge, they receive adequate fortification first before attending to the rest pods offshore.I insured mostly with 50%-75% which covered for most of the damages. And moreover my protection plan (holding the button up) was almost immediately before impact, which enabled me build and reinforce my pods before impact of the meteor.  c. Preparation for Risk affected the development of newer pods because, I had to reinforce the older pods that were to be damaged on impact of a meteor. The insurance of each pod can be increased or reduced depending on the Research carried out on the severity of impact of a meteor; and also the time spent on protection can be ascertained. 2. Since, I played the game more than once I started building my pods at the mainland far from the the shore, because these are the areas that are far from an impact/shock-wave of a meteor and whenever I built a new pod close to the shores I built a better fortification for them.I learnt that since Risks are inevitable due to voluntary and natural causes, then Risk management should also be an inevitable plan by us preparation and cushioning the effects of the impending danger or disaster.    I learnt that Research, helps me access the  magnitude of the Risk and gives me an edge in preparing adequately with Risk management tools e.g Insurance plans, which invariably gives me peace of mind and reduces or takes care of my loss on the advent of a catastrophe. Reinforcing of pods on the mainland helps me reduce damage level of the shock-wave, though it also reduced the building of newer pods.I reduced my insurance plans depending on the results of my Research in accessing an incoming meteor which invariably reduced my cost on the insurance and left me enough money to spend on building and reinforcing more pods that needs attention.  3. If I were to create an upgraded version of the game, I will add most importantly a section where players have the choices of materials for building tougher pods that will reduce impact.I will make available options to slow down or divert the incoming danger, probably by shooting at the meteor or creating spaces on ground to cushion their impact.There should also be avenue to create physical shock absorbs options before impact.  Options to better represent my Risk Management choices will be several Protection options instead of just one.Time frame can be increased of reduced depending on the level of Protection, the more the protection the shorter the time frame of impact and vise-visa.      ",

The\nrole of risk management was to prevent the damages and to try to minimize the\neffects of the hit of a comet\n\nThe\ninsurance must be in accordance to the level of damage predicted\n\nThe\npreparation for risks has not effects immediately, but saves money if a comet\nimpacts\n\n2.\nI played the game about 5 times. In the first 4 games I tried to develop a\nlittle community, conformed with just a few pods, but upgrading one or two of the\npods to high levels, meanwhile the other remained in the basic level. I thought\nthat, that strategy would increase my rate of development quickly and the\ncapacity to generate more money, so I would be able to pass to the next level\neasily and with the money obtained with the upgraded pods, I would construct\nlater the rest of the community. And that strategy was correct to reach to\nlevel 2 or 3, but it didn´t worked in level 4 because when there were damages\nby the impact of a severe comet, in spite of having cheap insurance and a medium\nlevel of protection (because I had spent many money in the development), the\ncost and the time of repairing them was very high due to the high level of\ndevelopment.\n\nI\nchanged the strategy in my 5th game and developed more pods, and all\nof them with a grade of development according to the level of the game, and developing\nall pods to the same level. So I had money in “my pocket” to protect and buy a\ngood insurance in case a severe comet was coming.\n\n3. In\norder to represent the risk management choices of Perú, the country where I\nactually live, I would devote the game to the risk management of an earthquake\n\nThe\ngame would be more realistic if the damages were associated to the death of\npersons. During the game you can repair the pods damaged, but the death of\npersons would be a bad record of your management\n\nI\nthink it would improve the game, if there exist the possibility to construct\npods following a policy (and the construction of that pods, would be more\nexpensive, but the damages of that pods in the case of a hit would less) or\ntaking the risks of constructing pods without following the policy (so the\nconstruction would be cheaper, but much more risky). \n\nBesides,\nI would include the possibility that not all the plots had the same risk of suffering\nthe consequences. I would include the possibility to develop campaigns to aware\nthe inhabitants, so the death would less when a tragedy occurs",

            "reflection": "1. This game is incorporates several levels of risk management. To succeed in the game, you must balance resilience with prosperity, while maintaining enough wealth to move to the next level. It illustrates the decisions that some people have to make daily to lead their households, companies, cities, and countries. It's impossible to know what it is like to be in a situation where you decide the fate of your country, but the RiskHorizon game makes you think about the choices you make. I had to sacrifice protection and insurance in order to develop and move on to the next level if the game. It was all connected and difficult to let go of what you wanted to accomplish to move on to the next level. I had to sacrifice knowledge and protection to make enough money to develop my island.It was difficult for me to play this game as a person who tends to be averse to risk and from a developed country. When I first started playing, I spent my time and money on protection of the island and insurance, but quickly found that I could not make it far with this strategy. For several rounds, I tried to see how much time and money I could spend protecting the island and still make it to round 2. I did make it to round 2 half of the time, but was stuck there with not enough pods to move forward. I began to concentrate on development and then beat level 2. however, after repeated tries, I never beat level 3.2. I played the game more times than I care to admit. After the first few tries, I concentrated more on development and less on protection and insurance. During construction, I did research. I also switched browser (from Chrome to Firefox), which aided me in beating level 2. I learned a lot from the game. I learned that development was important to risk management. I could not move up a level by protecting by island alone, I had to invest in my pods and learn from my research in order to reach prosperity. 3. If I were to add something to the game, it would be education. As it is, the game takes into account development, natural disaster, protection, and insurance. Education is a preventative measure that can affect several aspects of risk management. The game is difficult, but simplified. It does not incorporate education, human rights, knowledge, skills, and other necessary elements for success.",

            "reflection": "1) The risk management was a crucial part of being successful with the game.  A more cautious building/improving strategy was necessary in order to invest in protection and insurance.  Initially protection was the most important action because of the small incremental cost.  Afterwards, insurance purchased based on the research information about the likelihood of impact and the expected damage was important.  Specifically, if a high-risk and high severity comet was coming, I would stop any building in order to save the necessary resources to purchase an appropriate insurance plan.2) If playing again, I would more accurately evaluate the potential impact of the comets and perhaps increase the amount of building done.  After level 2, I was very cautious and rarely had any damage - perhaps it would have been more successful if I had better weighted the consequences and been willing to accept slightly more risk. 3)  Additionally, while a comet's impact is obviously a good way to show risk, and purchasing insurance is a point that was supposed to be made more clear, there didn't seem to be enough importance placed on for example infrastructure improvements.  For example, governments when choosing how to invest must also pay attention to public opinion - so perhaps a change to the game would be to have \"newspaper headlines\" giving information on \"public opinion\" about how the current government is spending the tax dollars *e.g. enough on public works, or insurance, etc.  A point in the video was that governments have a hard time investing in some risk avoidance measures because it is less tangible.  This isn't a main aspect of the game and would be important to improve.The game seems to be geared towards a younger crowd, which is fine on the one hand.  But as an adult Coursera participant, I think a less \"action based\" game would have been more helpful for understanding the course content. I don't know what the target age group was for this game, but it doesn't seem to match the probable age of the average Coursera participant.",

            "reflection": "Risk management played the role of helping balance between opportunities and threats in the light of managing existing resources while being optimistic of growth.I noticed there were nine available plots of land on the island. however i realized that i didn't have to develop all of the available plots. I realized that the task had different levels, Initial development and upgrades. I had to make a trade offI had to avoid complete development of plots but instead developed five (5) out of nine (9) of the land mass and applied more resources into the quality of the developed plots as well as purchasing the highest available insurance cover for the developed plots. I also raised my island to match the level of protection and as a result had minimal loss during attacks. I felt that a higher quality of infrastructure and insurance was a lot better than developing more plots with less quality of development and lower insurance cover.I played the game twice and in the first instance i developed more plots and had less quality of development since most of my resources went into base development and insurance cover.The main thing I learnt from the game is that one always has to think like the economist in Lionel Robbins which seeks to handle the relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses. Considering that economics is a social science dealing with humans and circumstances are not always the same, I was able to look at the similarities in the first and second attempt at the game but able to distinctly handle them in the context of present realities and simply not expect that the situation i met in the first attempt would be exactly the same as the case in the second.I also appreciated the concept of insurance as it helped lower my rebuild cost in the situation that i had suffered some damage. I usually opted for maximum cover.I can summarize my strategy as1. Build on less than 60% of available land mass2. Develop the plots built to at least a level 4 building status3. Acquire Level 3 Insurance cover4. Place the houses in a particular pattern of proximity5. Raise Island to at least and in most cases above the marker on the right barIf  I had to affect the game development. i will suggest that there disparity in land cost / building designs and that there be a distinction in insurance costs based on specific building types and designs",

            "reflection": "Firstly, I would like to say the risk management game was\nthought carefully and was a good easement of our knowledge on the course martial.\nThe purpose of the game was to see our understanding of risk and the necessary\nstep required to overcome the difficulties that were encounter in the game. For\nexample, I had the knowledge of comets hitting my town (that was the risk) and\ninsurance was my protection. By spending extra money to insure my properties instead\nof building more, I was able to protect the properties I build instead of\nlosing everything I had due to the comets. \n\n                If I only\nplayed the game once I would only build few buildings and spend my money only the\nresearch because I’m trying to last us long us I can without taking many risk. This\nis due to the nature of the game. If I take lots of risk at the end I might\nlose everything I had and would have to start from the beginning again. But if\nyou get to play the game again and again, I would take many risks, for example I\nwouldn’t spend money on research, instead I would buy insurance if something\nhappens the insurance can cover me and my losses wouldn’t be much.  From the game I learned that taking risk advancers\nmight have high rate of return, and that a calculated gamble should be taken.  \n\nOne thing I would change about the game is to show the\nplayer the abound percent they would lose if comet hit there city. By doing so,\neach players will have better understanding to how they should strategize to an\noutcome the favors there path. Out I found was when I ignore some comets, there\naffect was very high.  All and all the\ngame was good, and enjoined playing it. \n\n",

            "reflection": "In this game, as the Luminator of Alora, My job was to develop the community and take measures to protect the community from being destroyed by falling comets which careen into the water and cause waves that hinder the community's development. In order to reach the target, the appropriate risk management was indispensible. Since all kinds of risk management cost the limited resources and each way cost differently, in the lower level, I mainly chose to use the Protection which is a long-term investment and can effectively prevent my pods form being damaged by those small comets. As the level was rising, the severity of the comet was higher and hit chance was also rising. In the mean time, My community was full of built pods, each possible shock would bring me the unexpectable huge damage.And thus, I had to use the Insurance to transfer the damage and reduce the loss. During the game, I found the Research was not so effective, so I rarely used that and I could save more resources to develop my community.I had played the game twice. At the fist time, I tried to get familiar with the rule and assessed the effect of different kinds of risk manangement ways. Then I found the Research was some kind useless. At the second try, with the experiment from the first time, I reduced the use of the Research, increased the use of the Protection and bought the more expensive insurence when the level began higher. And later I successfully finished the expected task. I thought the most main thing I learned from the game was that I should control the trade-off between the gains and losses and make a right risk management plan before doing whatever. When I make risk management plan in the real life, I always hope there would be a way which can thoroughly avoid the all risk forever. In this game, the Alora is faced with the threat of tidal wave caused by the comets, so whether is there some kind risk management to prevent the Alora from being hit? How about a weapon which can directly destroy the comets? Yes, I think that kind weapon should be added to the game. Obviously, in order to keep the game equal, this weapon needs cost a lot, and there will be a long cooling time which will restrict the player to frequently use it.",

            "reflection": "1. The role of the game was the development of the community of pods, and making choices with limited resources of how to defend the pods from the danger of crashing comets. It was difficult at first to recognize what defenses worked best against different types of comets with different risks of impact. In particular, I believe that I spent too much of my resources purchasing insurance, and not enough time doing research on the comets. When I adjusted my strategy later in the game, my results were better.2. I spent a lot more time doing research the second time I played. I didn't realize at first the impact that it had on mitigating the effects of the comets.3. I would add the opportunity to add other mitigation features to individual pods that have more importance, and that require bigger investments. So for example, it might be possible to completely insure a level 4 pod, or perhaps build a specific fence or mitigation feature for that pod.",

            "reflection": "The game simulated risk management by forcing the player to balance the available resources (center of attention, money, and click-time) between growing a settlement and protecting it.  During the course of play, I found it to be a good idea put most of my research into comets with a high likelihood of impact and that also have a high severity of impact.  Higher severity comets would require more time to connect the colony and raise it.  Additionally, the speed of the comet played a factor as slower moving comets could be dealt with in between making improvements and increasing protection.  The most immediate concerns were providing for protection rather than researching the comets, as without anything to protect, comet research is pointless.  That being said, each time I worked towards disaster preparation, the growth of the colony slowed.I played through the game twice.  The first time I was unable to meet the growth quota for the fifth level, and both times I never took any damage.  I learned the best thing to do was build many small developments at the beginning so I would have the cash flow to make improvements.  Additionally, were I to take any damage, any repairs would be inexpensive.  My first protection moves were to raise the colony a few levels up.  I then followed the comet strategy mentioned above.  I only bought insurance when it appeared that a fast moving, high intensity comet was going to hit me and I wouldn't be able to research sufficiently.  It turned out this was unnecessary.  My growth strategy was to let my money accumulate while researching the most severe comets and then growing many structures simultaneously.  I would raise the colony only if it dropped back to the white bars.  This strategy worked as I would not only meet my quota but also exceed it greatly giving me a large surplus to start the next level with.The game does an excellent job of forcing the player to actively switch between required activities.  The form of each part of the game made it impossible to ignore any part entirely.  I don't know if it was just my strategy that prevented my needing the insurance or a game mechanic, but I might try to find a new way to have the insurance make more of an impact.  For future versions, maybe you could explore adding complexity to the game.  It might not be something one can do in a short \"real-time strategy\" game, but adding different kinds of threats to the mix could or additional ways of protecting the colony would be interesting and convey the scale of difficulty risk managers face.  Maybe the next game could feature balancing protective measures with level of inconvenience for the population?",

            "reflection": "I think the role of risk management in the game was fairly\nstraightforward, as the key to success was balancing the development of the\ncommunity against mitigating the effects of disasters.  Of course, this could be done in three ways: \n\nKnowledge: Researching comets to learn more\nabout the likelihood and potential impact of the coming disaster to better\nprepare accordingly.  It also effectively\nacts as a form of insurance in which the player is transferring their time from\ngood situations to bad.Protection: Building up the community’s defenses\nto reduce the impact of disasters after they hit.  \n\nInsurance: Transferring financial resources from\ngood times to bad in order to more quickly get the community functioning after\na disaster has struck.  Essentially, one had to develop the community in order to\nkeep the bar moving and win, but the player also had to be prepared for possible\nsetbacks by investing resources, which could otherwise go towards development,\ninto knowledge, protection, and insurance. \nOf course, transferring resources towards disaster mitigation negatively\nimpacted development in the short-run.  \n\nIf I could play the game over again I probably would not do\nit, because there does not seem to be much of a way of actually winning.  The first few times I played through I generally\ntried a mitigation-maximizing strategy, on the assumption that a game about\nrisk management would encourage minimizing risks.  However, that did not work, and I figured it\nwas probably because risk management is about also seeking, and taking\nadvantage of, opportunity.  Therefore, I\nnext tried more development-based strategy, which did not do very well\neither.  \n\nSince high-risk, low-risk, and balanced attempts all did not\nwork very well, I figured I needed to get smarter about how I balanced my\nrisk.  At that point I figured that\nbecause risk management is generally about transferring resources from good times\nto bad, and because we can transfer both financial and time resources, I needed\nto do a better job of balancing how I distributing my money and time.  Therefore, I figured that since in the early\ngame financial resources are relatively scarce, and time resources are\nrelatively abundant, I would focus on using my time to mitigate risks by researching\ncomets, and focusing my financial resources on development.  As the game went on, and my financial\nresources became more abundant, relative to time, I would focus more of my\ndisaster-mitigation efforts on resource-dependent methods, such as insurance\nand protection.  To me this strategy\nseems to best represent real-world risk management and explain why developed\ncountries, such as the Netherlands, focus their disaster mitigation efforts on\nresource-dependent strategies, such as building dykes, whereas developing\ncountries focus disaster mitigation on time-dependent methods, such as building\ncommunity support.  Of course, in the\ngame this strategy did not work either.  \n\nAs for improving the game, the biggest aspect that could\nchange is just making it a little easier, as there does not seem to be a\nconsistently viable strategy of winning. \nAlso, I would change how the insurance system works.  At present, the best strategy with insurance\nis to wait until the last instant before the comet hits before buying it, which\nof course is extraordinarily stupid in the real world, because the point of\ninsurance is that people do not know when disaster will strike and the system\ndepends on people paying-in during good times. \n\n\n",

Effective risk management\napproaches can not only protect the poor – they can also unlock opportunities\nfor better development outcomes.\n\nTo achieve the objective\nof the game which is to develop community to the best of the ability,\nrisk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the\nability to cope once a risk has appeared. Preparation  includes a combination of three actions that\ncan be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge (gathering information and making judgments\nabout risk); obtaining protection (to influence the likelihood and magnitude of\nrisk); and obtaining insurance (to transfer resources between good and bad\nperiods).\n\nIn the game we must find\nthe balance between growing the community and preparing for potential shocks (comets\ncareen into the water and cause waves that hinder development).\n\n\n\nAcquiring knowledge is the\npower to look out into space and accumluate research (learn the chance of the comet hitting, the\ntime until impact, and the severity of the comet). With each extra point, we\nreceive more time to create community connections right before the comet hits,\nhelping boost the protection.\n\n\n\nBy matching the level of\nprotection against the waves with the severity of the comet, we can prevent pods from being\ndamaged (by raising the island).\n\nBy obtaining insurance,\npods damaged from flooding will be quicker and cheaper to rebuild. Insurance\nalso recovers lost development time after you pods are repaired.\n\nBy using these three\npowers in concert with development, we will help create a healthy community. The\nonly way to succeed is to find the perfect balance between these three powers,\nbut it isn’t so easy. Each action takes time and has cost that can be used to\nmake another action, achieving another (sometimes better) result. This is\noften a simple cost vs. benefits formula. \n\nWith good preparation, only\nminimal coping may be needed to recover quickly— leaving more resources available for investment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks. Coping actions include updating knowledge and then deploying any insurance and protection. \n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management is essentially the act of balancing between opportunities for growth and protection/management of threats. Trade-offs for money exist between building (upgrading)  a new pod or buying insurance or increasing protection, and/or research. The later two also create a trade-off for time - creating protection and research take both time to establish which means you have to stay with only one thing. There were potential for optimisation: ie if I knew the meteorite to be of minor severity I could increase my protection instead of researching the meteorite - this would be able to protect me against future meteorites of similar or less severity, without investments into repair. (However with meteorites of higher severity research is the only thing that can at least partially handle the problem.) Research, as far as I could tell, allowed me to minimize that damage for the meteorites with created severity. Insurance fulfilled a similar function. I found insurance particularly beneficial and made a pattern of insuring at the maximum level - that allowed me to lift the funds restriction on growth potential after a catastrophe. However increasing protection implied that the water increase was placed on hold while the level of the elevation went up - hence the pay-off for safer territory was very costly when taking into account time restrictions. As you learned more about the rules of the game you learned the interactive components - ie that research doesn't always lead to more protection, and at best only minimises the damage, that on the third level the time pressure makes it almost impossible to gather necessary amount of water on time. Also, that meteorites that seem less likely to hit at first often do indeed make contact with unanticipated consequences - ie contrary to research.  This made me more likely to take out insurance as the only thing I could rely on as predictable risk management tool. However, when the first meteorite did not have high severity (ie could be avoided by elevating the pod platform), or high probability (less than 3) it would make sense to ignore it and focus on development. The most unpleasant series of events happened when the meteorites would connect in rapid sequence giving you barely enough time to repair pods, and not enough time to gather water. One of the changes I would make to a game is that I would amend the ability to repair pods that were crashed while under construction - if I just started constructing the pod, it should take less time to repair it, and then it should require additional time for completion of construction. This way there is no added incentive to build just before a collision as a way to expedite the production facilities. ",

            "reflection": "The game was really helpful in making the player understand risk management in a simplified way. In the game advancing the pods are necessary for development and the falling meteors acts as the risk element. It is balance between insurance taken , the research on the meteors and the elevation of the land by protection which will help the player to advance to the next level. The main trade-off is between and the researching a meteor and the protection of the surface. We wont be able to do both together and a lot of time is consumed in this. Taking insurance is a safe method and it will cost to our total resources. I had to play the game at least 10 times to reach level 5 and during each game I experimented on each factors like first using insurance and fast advancement which landed me nowhere, but the next time when i started with a balance in protection and advancement i was able to go much higher levels by buying insurance only when i was sure research will not help or when severity was too high compared to protection . Also the channeling of resources among the pods helped to raise the protection bar because of which in most cases the damage to pods was averted. So for me the takeaway is timely decision along with a balance trade-off in research and protection against a risk help us to manage risk more effectively.",

            "reflection": "1. In terms of the tradeoffs, the main tradeoff was in terms of maintaining the cash levels for development while at the same time having enough cash for the risk mitigation measures. There was also another level of trade off involved which was among knowledge, protection and insurance. My strategy was to invest heavily on protection and knowledge to minimize the damage caused by the impact and hence afford a lower insurance cost. The impact this strategy had on development was that there was a rush/crunch towards development pre-impact while there was always little or no damage because of the impact.\n2. The game drove home a clear message that risk, though of varying magnitude (strength of impact of the comet), is inevitable.  Some risks are prone to a particular area while others happen sporadically (chance of hit). But for successful growth of a community, opportunities have to be pursued in this risk-filled environment.  Risk acts as a great impediment to development but there are always measures to deal with risk both pre and post occurrence of the risk event (comet impact). \nThese measures become even more effective when they are pooled together by a community (the island in the game) rather than an individual (pod) as it may be difficult for one individual/household to adopt measures of such high magnitude. One proactive measure of risk mitigation is to create the necessary infrastructure based on the risks that are repetitive in a particular geography – one example would be using proper construction techniques/materials in higher seismic zones similar to the angle of elevation on the island. The second measure would be community/state driven investments in warning mechanisms, like the research tab in the game which can be compared to the tsunami alert systems installed across the globe. \nSometimes, it is very difficult to cope up with the impact left behind by the occurrence of a risk event. But if the community can predict the frequency of the risk event, then insurance provides the best possible mitigation. One of the best examples is the rainfall insurance in countries like Ghana and India where the frequency of monsoon failure is very high. \nIt is amidst all this risk, that opportunities for growth and development are present. The construction and up gradation of the pods on the island cannot stop because there are risks of damage being caused by a comet impact. Instead, it is important to pursue these opportunities by taking proper mitigation measures, like the ones listed earlier, and cover for the risk event. \nIn conclusion, the game was a close replication of a real life scenario in any community and educates the importance of risk mitigation measures and community pooling of risk in order to pursue the opportunities for the great good of the society as a whole.\n3. One change that I would bring in to the game would be to create a cost benefit ratio for the risk event thus showing the importance of analyzing the extent to which risk will affect development and take the precautionary measures in a measured manner (neither over-invest nor under-invest in such measures).\n",

The role of risk management was to get information in term of knowledge about the potential risk, developed pod to for protection, raise the level of the island to fight against potential hit from comets, carry out research to learn more on the risk reinforce protection.In doing this we took an insurance cover for damages that could occurs after a hit thereby preparing to cope with losses. Hence, An\neffective risk management strategy needs to account for both the preparation\nfor risk before it occurs (ex ante) and coping with the consequences of risk\nafter its materialization (ex post). Learning lessons from a past risk that has\nactually occurred (a “materialized risk”) can certainly help design the\npreparation for risk.In making choices  in term of knowledge i carry out a research to learn more on the potential comet or threat; in term of protection i builds high level pod all around the island and at the same time raising up the level of the island to withstand the eventual hit or shocks that could occurred; in term of insurance, i  purchased an insurance cover that will help to refinance an damaged resulting from any hit and destruction.The preparation for risk affected development immediately in term of time, resources and planning. whereas it affected development after in term of slowing down the development process of the community due to rebuilding due to damages and losses.2. What i did after playing the game the first time was to go back on getting more knowledge on the game process, by identifying the obstacles i first in the various trial, planning on how to overcome those obstacles and at the same time learning on how to cope with them to success. In this case i try to build more pods for protect while rising the island to fight against potential hit. carrying out more research once a potential comets is spotted taking into account the time limit. while avoid to commit the same errors made during the previous sessions. taken an insurance policy one the shock is more relevantly due to occur. Lessons form the game-Getting knowledge of the risk-Developing strategies to control the risk-Building protection in time to counter the effect of the risk-Carry out research to learn more on the risk- Taken advantages of available opportunities to cope with the risk-Taken an insurance cover that keep the community on going after the shock or losses.3.

But when the threat is imminent, protection was the key action.Preparation for risk affected development in different ways:\n\n·        \nAs a general rule, preparation\nreduced the financial resources available for development.\n\n·        \nOn the other hand,\npreparation allowed swifter recovery which helped me bring development back on\ntrack.\n\nQ2\n\nAfter playing several times, I started:\n\nFocusing on early\npreparation as much as I can,Prioritizing the threats\naccording to intensity  speed,Delaying full scale\ndevelopment until I had enough preparation,Choosing expensive\ninsurance when protection was inadequate, and less expensive insurance when it\nwas improved.I learned from the game:\n\nHow to handle resources in\ntimes of crises, either financial or available time.Prioritizing threats\naccording to intensity to focus on severe ones, while not neglecting smaller\nrisks.I improved my grasp on the\ndynamics of risk management, especially when it’s related to preventive measures,\nthe role of research, transferring risks, crisis response,,,Q3\n\nIf I propose changes in the game, I would have:\n\nFocused on the response\npart a bit more because it is crucial and has a deep impact on the rest of the\nrecovery track.Added other variables such\nas food, water, shelter, energy ,,, to make it more realistic.Added various levels of\nimpact according to location and valueAdded the stability  security dimensions",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to utilize all aspects of what we have learned about risk management through the course thus far to protect a colony on a planet.  It was important to correctly balance your resources between upgrading your colony, buying insurance, buying protection, and using your time to research possible threats to the colony. The obvious trade offs in the beginning was whether to upgrade the colony and having to determine possible risks and buying the appropriate insurance and protection to handle possible negative shocks. I found out that if I invested too much in insurance and protection I didn't have enough resources to invest in upgrading the colony. It seemed that investing in upgrades was what gained me the most points to reach my goal per each round so it was imperative to figure the right balance in protection, insurance, and development. I also noticed that by invested in upgrades to the colony I made more money, so the obvious benefit to investing in upgrades was making more money that would then allow me to invest more in other avenues of risk management.I played the game more than once and realized to achieve my goal level I had to invest more in colony upgrades and protection over insurance. I also realized that by doing more research on the incoming comets the severity and likelihood of in collided with my colony would lessen. The main thing I took from the game was an example of how utilizing risk management prior to negative shocks can quickly deplete your resources but also how investing in insurance and protection prior helps tremendously in coping from negative shocks. Although the game was a general experience and simplistic it gave me a better understanding on how risk management should be utilized and the interconnection of investment and payoff.If I were to change one aspect of the game to make it more realistic to the area in which I live would be more natural disasters, such as earthquakes. The possible threats in the game came from threats off the planet but adding additional threats, like earthquakes, drought, tornadoes, flood, would force you to better manage your assets in case of additional negative shocks. ",

The game does not give me clean instruction to play the necessary role when the situation present, or near by.  I play the game 5-6 times, due to no ideal how to make the choice to show my different role. To reduce the risk and catching the opportunity in our daily life, one must be alerts the situation they are facing, understand the outcome, having open mind to research the protential problems and gain knowledge to deal with. Always build family, friends, community network to have resource to help each others. Buying insurance to cover natural disaster also the smart way to have risk management to avoid unpleasant outcome. All in all, everything cost money, we better have good plant to reduce the risk we can not afford. Spend more time to research and learn the mother natural, respect it, it is powerful and humble  to be more focus, prepared for the disaster.    ",

            "reflection": "I played the Risk Horizon game and I was not very good at it. I don't play video games so I felt that I was at a disadvantage of not being quick or reactive to the rapid movements of the game. Then I realized thats what risk management is. If you are placed in a situation of crisis you will not possess all the movements and decisions that are required to eliminate damage or loss. Often you are placed in a situation where you have limited knowledge, protection and insurance to compensate for risk. It is how you learn and react from your mistakes is how you will improve your chances to minimize risk moving forward. While playing the game I tried different strategies of building the pod community. One strategy was to build out the community rapidly and not consider the proper amount of insurance needed to protect the community. Another strategy was not to build out at all and that strategy didn't work out either. The problem was education and insurance and not finding balance.As I played the game, it became apparent preparation of risk is very important in trying to balance out the other components of knowledge and insurance. You need all three.The question is how - what is the best way to do it quickly and effectively? I played the game several times and what I would do differently is increase my knowledge of comets and gain information from my peers that were also playing the game. I realize that our reading assignments spoke to that. The countries that had crisis studied the outcome from similar situations in other countries to increased their education and to reduce risk. Education/knowledge was the most important component of the game that I drew from.if I was in the position of developing a new version of the game, I would have a section where players could study the history of the planet and comet activity in more detailed fashion.This information would include comet activity on a monthly/yearly basis and the damage caused  and its value. It should also include information from other planets that have comet activity so information could be shared to reduce risk. I would also have an component where you have teams, this would be helpful in drawing strength from one another and reduce time and outcome. I wish that I could have done better playing the game but I learned a lot of the importance of risk management. ",

Knowledge gathered from different comets help\nin the process of planning as you strengthen the pods against the chance of hit\nand also buy insurance to cover for the losses that might occur. \n\nWhat\nwas done  differently, I played the\ngame twice it helped, for the first time I had little knowledge concerning\ncoming up with strategies to minimize on the impact of the comets this turned\nout to be a lesson and managed to balance the game where by I had to put as\nmany pods as I can because they kept on increasing my income slightly raised\nthe ground because raising it so high it is expensive to maintain. Consequently\nI managed to reduce on the on damages through repairs and this would increase\nmy income.\n\nDeveloping\na new version of the game, I would suggest including\nparticipatory approach in the game, because in this game the whole island’s\nsurvival highly relies on one man’s shoulders yet it depicts the image it’s a\ncommunity and their involvement is fundamental in the planning process.\nRegardless of relying on the insurance coverage it would be equally important\nto incorporate the international humanitarian intervention because in case the\nrisk is tougher than anticipated we really need their informed view about risk\nmanagement. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management plays a\ncrucial role while playing this game. I’ve made several choices\nlike, give major importance to insurance rather than protection or knowledge\nand the other way round. Preparation for risk affects development by increasing\nthe price and the time of repairing most of the times on the long run. Also\nsometimes not repairing at the first step was the best way to achieve better\nresults. So those were my trade-offs and unfortunately I didn’t went much\nfurther into the game with it.\n\nIf I played the game once I would try to be aware of\nall the interaction possible and try to make them work better for the final\nresult. In fact the major problem is to achieve the balance between, risk,\nknowledge, prevention, and less damage. I would like to be able to see how to\nget to level 6. It would be fantastic concerning “risk management”. \n\nIf I have to do the game several times I would always\ntry to improve by changing the things that from my point of view went wrong. Be\nmore cautious about the level of information the game give me and try to adjust\nfor better trade-offs and at the end better results.\n\nThe most important was resilience. Try to get further\nby making many different options and heaven tough I didn’t get much out of it\nwas really a question of mitigate my losses out of the adversity and always try\nto foster recovery for getting better management of the risks I’ve done\npreviously.\n\nOther important learning achievement was that\ndespising the fact the tools for managing the risk were available, it is\nnecessary to conjugate efforts to be able to go further. Even though the risk\nwas there so the losses were also a chance to account with.\n\nIf I was able to improve something in the game, one of\nmy proposals was a tool allowing integrating the family risks into the society like\nfor instance, unemployment and children and elderly insurance. \n\nAnother proposal was a tool to measure the stability\nof the community at all levels, government, enterprises and local environment.          ",

            "reflection": "1) The role of risk management in the game was that you had to kind of choose between protection or insurance. If you just picked insurance alone, all your developments got damaged after asteroids hit but you would only have to pay a small price fix them. However, If you chose to go for protection only, your developments would be raised and the asteroids would not damage your properties but the problem is that you would not be able to build developments fast enough to win the game. Preparation for risk affected development in that if you focused too much on the asteroid information, you ended up having a more reactionary approach and the problem with that is the asteroids had sometimes had a higher intensity than what the research data was indicating, so you would end up with damaged developments even though you were not expecting them. I was generally thinking the whole time during the game about going for protection as a main reducer of risk but it never worked out for me.2) The first time round I was confused about how to go about things because I did not understand what I need to prioritize as far as the elements of insurance, protection, knowledge and building settlements goes. The second time round I tried to have the settlements all in one small cluster and focused on protection and upgrading the five settlements in order to increase my chances of filling up the life meter. This strategy was not able to get me past level 2. I then chose to build as many settlements as possible and rely mainly on protection, but i still could not get through to level 3. After being utterly frustrated, I went all in with the insurance, but that only worked in level one as in the higher levels, I was not able to rebuild fast enough to fill up the life meter. I would literally fill it up, and then an asteroid hit my settlements with five seconds left on the clock. I finally went for a balanced strategy of insurance and protection and that is what finally got me though to level 3 and after a few more attempts, I was not able to go higher as every time you lost, you went all the way back to level 1.3) I loved the game because it was really challenging, and risk management in the real world is no piece of cake either. It is difficult and folks have to deal with allot of variables in order make a decision about how to help millions of people deal with natural disasters and other issues that may come up. So, in the big picture, I would not change a thing. On a micro scale meaning myself, I would not have people go all the way back to level 1 after failing at higher levels. I would prefer wrestling with the level I just lost, instead of going all the way back down.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was that with a limited number of resources/money and time, you had to continue developing your pods, while also protecting against comet attacks.  Comets were observed so that you had a better knowledge/understanding of the severity/potential damage, as well as the likelihood/chance of being hit.  At the same time, you had the option to buy insurance and you were expected to continue development throughout.  By taking the time and money to prepare for risk (observing the comet, spending money to increase your severity, and purchasing insurance), pod development had to be postponed.  But then when the pods got attacked, you were able to recover much faster because of all the steps you'd taken.  So it was much easier to recover from a disaster.  To succeed at the game, you also had to balance everything, you couldn't just focus on one or two tasks exclusively.  Instead, you had to do all of them together and quickly go back and forth to manage your risk (from various angles - observing the comet, increasing severity and purchasing insurance) and increase pod development.\n\nIf I were to play the game again, I would make sure that I do all of the above (pod development, observe the comet, purchase insurance, and increase severity to match).  Initially, I didn't spend enough time on comet observation, but once I did, then I got more time to recover from attacks and thus sustained less damage.  I'd also spend more time watching comets that have higher chance of hitting (i'd focus more on those).  If a comet is less dangerous (less severe and very low chance of hitting), I would observe for a bit, but then I'd focus on other tasks.  Whereas if it was high-risk (then I'd spend time observing and matching severity).\n\nIf I was to make one change to the game, I'd add financial risk.  While natural disasters such as comets are risks, in today's world, particularly, the financial market is such an embedded part of the world, that it consists of a risk.  You could enable this risk by the pods not always returning a consistent stream of income, and instead sometimes they don't give you the revenues/growth you expect.  It might be too complicated to implement this in the game, but a simple addition would be to add a random multiplicative factor to the $ coming from pod development, and that factor can very between 0.5 and 1.25.  This way, you could demonstrate the financial risks that impact people's salaries and firms growth prospects.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game required that I use my best judgement to make decisions about risk management and mitigation on a fictional planet. The most salient lesson that I took away from this game is that every individual situation was different, and there was no best solution to beat the game. Instead, the player needed to make decisions based on the specifics of each level. For example, when I began playing I placed a premium on purchasing insurance immediately, so as to insure myself against damage from a comet. But I eventually realized that sometimes I would “get lucky” and avoid severe comet damage during a level. In this case, it was best to delay the purchase of insurance until my research revealed a severe threat. If only non-severe comets emerged, I could simply pay out of pocket to repair the damage. And if my research revealed a comet that could cause severe damage, I could always purchase a better insurance policy.Moreover, I found that prevention is a double-edged sword. The high cost of protection reduced my ability to continue developing, and frequently caused me to miss my development goals and lose a level. I found it was best to achieve a marginal level of protection against minor comet strikes, and to use insurance to protect against serious hits. This allowed me to focus on development and not worry about minor comet strikes.The most important lesson I learned from the game was the need to balance different types of risk mitigation. For example, research could sometimes show that nearby comments were non-severe and unlikely to strike. In these cases, I could sacrifice money for protection and insurance. Instead of immediately spending this money on development, I would try to save it in case I needed more protection or insurance in the next level. I found it helpful to develop at a steady pace in each level, so that I always maintained a small “nest egg” in case of emergencies.If I were to create a new game, first of all, I would likely include an option to abandon the planet. It doesn’t make much sense to attempt to build a town in a place with such frequent catastrophes when, one assumes, there are better options elsewhere. If I were to develop a new game, I would require the player to choose one of three locations for development, each with different risks and levels of risk. At the beginning of each game, the player should choose the most hospitable location for development by evaluating the risks and benefits of each location through research.I would also include an opportunity for the player to leverage greater financial resources. I would have appreciated an opportunity to receive a loan to gain more protection or increase development in the short term, with the understanding that I would pay it off over time. Of course, this would make the game more complicated, so more time would be needed for play at each level. ",

            "reflection": "The risk management game combined situations of an economy needing to build up it's infrastructure while gaining knowledge about the environment. It was, at times, a tricky balance knowing when to build-out the community versus research a potentially catastrophic event. One of the ways I chose to mitigate risk was by always purchasing the highest quality insurance at the start of each new level of the game. Though sometimes expensive, it allowed me to focus my time on knowledge and protection. By allocating insurance funds at the start of the level I didn't have to spend my time worrying about whether my properties would be destroyed/ critically damaged when the next comet hit because if they were I would have the funds to repair.The first few times that I played the game I didn't research the incoming comets. Once I understood how important the research portion of the game was I was able to maximize my research time based on the severity/ chance of hit.  I live in a flat area of the United States. The region sees many tornadoes, often occurring spontaneously, providing little time to react. Our community has installed warning sirens. When the siren sounds, everyone makes their way to the basement. This, in some ways, represents the protection bar. The largest differences here would be damage faced based on infrastructural damage versus the damage a community would face with human fatalities. Luckily, the game doesn't try and quantify these things -- providing a simpler \"percentage damaged\" statistic. This is where the game and reality heavily differ. A risk manager, in any part of the world, will have many more complex factors to consider when identifying risk management strategy's.  The game also allowed for infrastructural development. Though not mentioned, this may signify the development of technology, health care, education etc. A community that is developing may be able to get to a point of specialization thus, allowing for faster research, better transfer of knowledge/ protection, and a generally more streamlined ability to grow. This wasn't well represented in the game. Both, knowledge and protection, grew at the same rate from level 1 through level 6. This, of course was an oversight needed for simplicities sack but, may actually play in the favor of reality. By creating this simplified world we have been able to further understand the need for balance, to combine the need to develop infrastructure while also mitigating risk.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management is key in this game, regarding the trade off between different actions you can take and the effect that has on the outcome.  I quickly learned the importance of building the pods, after failing the first time on the second level because my meter wasn't green.  I focused too much on protection to try and prevent a meteor hit, and less on researching and trying to develop sufficient communication chains to prevent/limit the damages.  Researching comets took much less time than raising the protection level, while at the same time the protection level affected all comets and not just one at a time like research did.  To be honest, I never used insurance because the levels didn't require it.  I found that using a mixture of research and protection was sufficient to reach level 5, which was the highest that I reached.I already mentioned earlier how I changed my approach after the first time I played, namely by building and updating more pods whenever I wasn't researching or raising protection.  The second and third times I played the game, I changed my strategy accordingly and at the start of each level I built pods or updated existing ones.  I did this again at precisely halfway through each level when I had a significant amount of money saved up.  It didn't take long to do this, and after I immediately started to research and protect once again.  The main thing I learned is that all choices have a trade off.  If I spent time raising protection, that was time I couldn't spend researching the individual comets.  My strategy was to raise the protection to about 7 or 8, depending on the first group of comets, and then research each individual comet in order of landing and severity.  If a comet had a high chance to hit and a high severity, I would fully research it whenever possible.  I ended up having to connect a wireless mouse so I could perform the clicks necessary to build a communication chain faster, and this strategy seemed to work quite well.I had to think for awhile about the third part of this question, because risk management on a larger scale in a game like this isn't something I'm used to considering.  However, I liken this to a Sim City type of game, which questions the decisions that city planners make regarding public programs, zoning, planning, and other things on an urban planning level.  I think I would make the game a little more involved, with a goal of making a successfully growing city.  Similar to this game, there would be tradeoffs involved, but more in the game I would create.  The city planner would have to decide on an infrastructure system, where to place residential/industrial/commercial zones, what government programs would be in place, etc.  The main restriction would be the total budget, which can be increased by citizens by an amount depending if they are commercial/industrial/residential.  It's hard to completely lay out the entire premise of a game in 200-300 words that I had left after answering the first 2 parts, but it would be a more realistic tradeoff involving financial decisions that actually affect a real city.  Real cities don't have only 3-4 choices as in the game we played for the assignment, there are many more that they have to balance.  ",

            "reflection": "I think in this game, risk management is about how to use limited resources (money) to get a balanced result (protection and development). I played the game several times, at the first time, I bought the insurance at the very beginning of each level and only built 3 of the pods and kept developing them first. This strategy doesn't work for me since buying insurance lost money which could be used for development or building new pods. For the second time, based on the knowledge of severity of attack, I chose the protection level matched to severity and didn't buy insurance at all. Most of the time, this strategy works, however, the knowledge is not accurate enough (uncertainty) sometimes. I tried to use two different strategies, one is buy insurance, the other is increasing the level of protection and making protection higher than the predicted severity. Both of them worked in some way, From the game, it is quite obvious that if we can protect well without vigorously affecting development, we can pass the level for sure. Once the damage occurred, it is very hard to recover, especially if the damage happened in later stages. Buying insurance would help recovery, but the effect is limited. I feel like good preparation is the best way to reduce damage and for overwhelming damage, insurance is necessary. In the game, it is hard to determine when would be a best time to buy insurance. Just as in reality, insurance won't be executed for approximately half of the times. Also, I found that if I build more pods at the beginning and even though each of the pod won't develop very fast, but the overall green bar grows faster in this way(compared to less pods with higher levels) I think this may implicate that the wider-coverage protection with lower level would be more effective than partial protection with high level. If I would developing a new version of the game, I would make what factors influence the speed of green bar more clearly.",

            "reflection": "Risk management in any form is a “game” of making more\ninformed decisions, and better choices. I believe this game very well\nillustrated both proactive measures (insurance, preparedness, research), and\nreactive measures (need for information connections) that are essential to\nthink through and analyse complex scenarios. It was clearly visible, that some\nchoices have more immediate, but at the same time less efficient effects (raising\nthe level of the island); while others need time to be efficient, but have long\nlasting effects (developing buildings). I liked the insurance option, and how\nit effects my decisions as well. I always opted for the basic coverage only,\nbut at every level I felt the need to purchase insurance as soon as possible. Having\nonly basic insurance coverage may not be the most rational choice, but one that\nwas immediately apparent to me. The game also reflected well how risk\nmanagement sometimes is a complex multitasking matrix, constantly trying to\nfactor changes in decisions.\n\nI have played the game twice, but aligned strategy within\none game as well. My first attempt was more of an intuition game, then as we\nwent ahead, I developed some sort of a strategy. I also found it useful to base\nthis strategy on historic events and not only my own experiences. Looking at\nhow to succeed, I also read through feedback from other learners (in discussions).\nIn general, this is a great way not to have to deal with all difficulties\nyourself.\n\nIf I wanted to further develop the game, I would probably\nadd in a new government policy at one point, which you need to comply with. (And the sudden implementation of a\nrandom policy may be a very valid example from the country I am from.) In this\ngame, I could imagine a policy that comes in effect all of a sudden, as a way\nof protection for future events, but immediately is also as a „burden” that\nneeds to be dealth with, within a limited time frame. Another aspect of\ndisasters that could be easily included is the amount of false information\npopping up after each disaster (among the green ones, some red spots could also\npop up that you should not click on.) One needs to really pay attention to\nfigure out what are real, valid and useful pieces of information. All in all, I\nbelieve this game was a good representation of basic risk management concepts.",

            "reflection": "for construction of pods we have to face many risks .to over come the risks or to reduce them we have to take some steps to adapt to the situation and successfully overcome them. insurance should be made as a precaution against any untoward incidents such as natural calamities. Also enlighten about the unexpected incidents like cyclones,tsunsmies,earth quakes by observing the forecasts given by the environment department of government from time to time to reduce or minimize the impact on the development of the project. We have to be more alert to the vagaries of nature and carefully watch the situation to face the situation . In the event of any loss even though necessary precautions have been taken ,the loss can be claimed from insurance company with which we have obtained insurance policy for the project.To take remedial measures some research work also should be made about the history of the place, area and types of natural and unnatural calamities took place in the area and its frequency to enable to equip to the situation.Here the comets are hitting the village destroying the constructions and to avoid hitting's we have to be more alert to the situation  by balancing the situation.Inspite of of it even if there is loss the loss can be recovered from the Insurance company. so that we can proceed with the development work taken up in the villageWe should not stop taking up of developmental works fearing risks,but have to face the risks by taking remedial measures to overcome them and proceed with developmental works .This is the main objective to pursue development. Risk management is the main objective for development  .Here even though steps or precautions have been taken for overcoming the risks, unless the social and economic systems such as warnings and Insurance company has also played an important role  in managing the risks that come across in the development of the village.Thus risk can be avoided  by taking the remedial measures .Here in the case of the development of the village steps to be taken to avoid the hitting's by comets  and even in spite of the precautions taken there is financial loss it can be made up by the insurance  company as  the project has been insured.Therfore for achieving      prosperity and to produce resilience we have to confront and manage risk.I have tried the game thrice,and each time thee is improvement in achieving the target and .Third time I can able to overcome the risks by following the  instructions given and avoided the comets hitting the village. From this it is obvious that there is no development without risk and we have to confront risk and  manage it.Share them with others and communities can overcome easily and it is a powerful tool for development.The other ways to avoid the risk of hitting t he comets  the village ascertain the frequency and the time and season so that we can plan to avoid the hittings and to shift to safer places .",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon was a practical way to confront and apply the\ncomponents of risk management, as policy makers are similarly tasked.  I tended\nto build first, then do research to determine shock imminence and severity.   Each action\nhad a true cost and an opportunity cost, so doing more research meant less time\nfor building, upgrading, repairs, or protection.  The game definitely showed in real money terms\nthat good preparation for risk, produced immediate effects in development, and\nlong term effects in mitigation and coping of the communities.\n\nAfter using the tutorial and playing the first time, I\nlearned that research was pivotal to successful risk management.  If research indicated that shock severity and\nimminence were low, then I would buy insurance, because it proved cheaper than\nwhen a shock was perhaps 80-90% sure to happen. \nI would also continue development, upgrading and protection at these low risk\nperiods.  Research was not stagnant and\nsustained monitoring produced changes in knowledge, to better inform choices regarding\nprotection, insurance, building, upgrading and repairs.   When\nResearch was at maximum capacity of 10, damage from shock was\nsignificantly lowered, driving repair costs and time frame downward, sometimes to nil.  Building and protection went hand in hand\nwith direct, positive and immediate effects on development. \nWhen a shock was imminent it was too late to protect development and too\nexpensive to insure against its impact.  Insurance --especially the maximum packages available -- really helped to keep repair costs down, and smaller repair costs translated into less extensive repairs, and thus faster recovery.  Also, the more advanced the stage of development, the more important Research became in mitigating repair costs, which were rising with every new level of upgrading.  Protecting the community was expensive from an opportunity cost\nperspective, but it was very useful to have invested in such research, because\nit also helped to drive down shock impact and  repair costs, and made coping easier.  Sometimes though, even when insurance was in\nhand, protection applied and research efforts sustained, damage was still high\nperhaps to demonstrate that information can still be imperfect, and that high\ndamage may not necessarily indicate poor risk management.  Ultimately I learned that risk management can be low pressure during low risk periods and high pressure as risk probability and severity rises.  Successful risk management calls for striking a balance between choices made  for development, upgrading, protection and resilience building activities, during low and high risk periods, all within a context of limited resources, changing information, and time sensitive development goals.  \n\nIf Risk Horizon had to be altered to simulate\nthe risk management choices in my region, perhaps I would change the shocks to more\nthan just one type.  In the Caribbean\nregion we are affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, severe flooding, landslides\nto name a few, and sometimes one can follow or cause the other.   I may\nalso change it so that a player who has successfully navigated up to level 2,\ndoes not start again at Level 1, if unsuccessful at Level 3.  My rationale is that attaining Level 2 means\nsome success in risk management – community linkages and strengthening,\ndevelopment and  upgrading, and continued\nresearch and protection.  Resumption at\nLevel 2 may simulate more real life scenarios in that, not all shocks return us\nto ground zero – the place before any risk management strategy was applied.  ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to keep your\nvillage in good shape until the 6th level where you lose automatically and\neveryone dies a horrific, meteoric death. \n\n\nI never bought any insurance.  A balanced approach to upgrading, elevation\nincreases, and research pretty much gave me plenty of time and money to reach\nthe last level where all of my hard work was given the Cretaceous Period\ntreatment.  Building up some elevation\nearly allowed for quick increases when more dangerous threats emerged.  Other than that, just constantly researching\nuntil enough money became available for an upgrade and then switching back to\nresearch on the greatest threat was my entire strategy.  \n\nI played the game multiple times because twice it crashed\nsomewhere in the fifth level with a \"Fatal Error : null\" message so\nthe main thing I learned from playing it was that the people who made it need\nto do some more debugging.  \n\nI know the assignment asks for just one recommended change,\nbut I'm submitting two anyway.  First, there\nshould be some additional logic added that limits the strength of the meteors\nbased on level.  I got an intensity nine,\nprobability nine meteor on the first level which I'm pretty sure is impossible\nto survive that early.  Second, I would\nchange the end of the game so that it informs the player that they didn't, in\nfact, lose, but that the game only has 6 levels.  The message should congratulate them on doing\nsuch an amazing job by making it all the way to the end without triggering the\n\"Fatal Error : null\" message which is infinitely more deadly than any\nof the meteors.\n\nAs for how the game could better represent the dangers faced\nwhere I live, all I can say is add publicly-accessible underground shelters.  I live in the Midwest so we have very little\nto worry about when it comes to natural disasters besides tornadoes.  It is always surprising to me when a tragedy\nlike the Joplin tornado from a few years back causes so much death, and yet people\nare still expected to manage their own disaster preparations at their own cost\nafterward.  The funds needed to dig a big\nhole and put some concrete around it doesn't sound like something that should\nbe prohibitively expensive when it concerns public safety.  Millions of dollars are spent every year\nclearing roads of snow and ice in the name of public safety and productivity,\nsurely a giant hole could be put in the budget.The instructions for this deal say to write a 400-word essay, but this text-box says to paste in a 600-word essay.  I'm going to go with 421 and call it good.",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection\n\nIn\nplaying and succeeding in the Risk Horizon game, risk management played an\nimportant role in that one needed to think ahead of time how to develop and\nmaintain Alora. This meant that one had to prepare in advance by way of\nresearch (where you obtain knowledge), protection and insurance in order to\navoid any effects of future damages that might occur when a comet hits or if it\nhits, how you can minimize the effect of the damage. Community connections also\nplay an important role after a comet hits since it reduces the level of damage\na clear case of managing risk through pooled resources. In terms of making\nchoices among knowledge, protection and insurance, I chose more of knowledge\nand protection as compared to insurance because spending time on research\nensured I had more time to build and upgrade while giving me the knowledge I\nneeded in order to protect myself against hitting comets by raising the island\nup. Once these two were in place, I was certain of having missed comets or\nincase there was a hit, I quickly made community connections which helped in\nreducing the damages caused by the hit. Insurance came in handy after damages\nhave occurred due to the fact that it reduced the cost of repairs made on each\npod.\n\nI\nplayed the game several times. The first time I played, I placed more emphasis\non insurance right from level 1 and didn’t make much use of research and\nprotection. Since every action in the game cost money, it was necessary to cut\ndown on any extra costs that one could avoid otherwise so I avoided buying\ninsurance until I had built all pods and upgraded them- somewhere level 3. At this\npoint, damages would cost more to repair so having an insurance plan came in\nhandy as they reduced the cost of repairs. Also since I was aiming to beat the\ngauge on the development meter, it was necessary to build and upgrade pods in\norder not to lose the level.  I learned\nthat insurance wasn’t always necessarily the first option for risk management\nas important and helpful as it could be against future contingencies. Knowledge\nwas also important to help make informed decisions that could lead to\nprotection.\n\nIn\norder to better represent risk management choices and add to the game, there\nshould an option to borrow money to refinance once you are out of wealth but\nstill want to develop.",

In the game, the risk management shows how to manage risk to save lives or everything in earth from comets' disaster.In term of Knowledge, we know what we face (the danger), we can take more safety systems to get protected from (Protection), and for Insurance, when we know the nature of the risk, after applying Protection measure, we could know that we can avoid it, but we can decrease its effects on goods and human being.2. What I learnt from the game is that, we still hesitate about knowing very well the danger (comets) before getting protected and also we say, we should better get insurance once we know the dangers existence.So we can change every time these parameters (knowledge, protection, insurance) to minimize damages on the planet.3. If I should innovate the game, I would add more protections systems, or the choices between several protection methods, to represent the risk management that matter in the place I live.",

            "reflection": "Risk Management refers to preventing loss\ndue to comets striking the water.  Clearly, developing the community as fast as\npossible was the primary purpose of the game. However, using some funds to\nsecure insurance or protection (or both) were the trade-offs I was confronted\nwith.  The amount of protection and\ninsurance varied depending upon the situation (the severity of the comet and\nthe probability of the comet striking the community).\n\n \n\nI played the game several times to\nunderstand how various factors played out against one another. Initially I was\nplaying it too safe and unable to score sufficient points to move to the later\nstages. However after a few rounds it was clear that securing as many points as\npossible, while keeping an eye on the severity and probability of impact was\nthe most important thing to consider. \nThe reason being that the more one builds out the community, the greater is the\nincrement in funds (every 4 second period).  So if initially the funds are used to build\nthe community, the amount of funds available towards the later part of the game\n(at each level) will be greater as opposed to using the funds to buy protection\nor insurance and then not having sufficient gunds to build out the community. \nAttempting to build protection -greater than or equal to comet’s severity, was\nbetter than buying insurance. However, if towards the END of the round (when\ncommunity is most developed) a highly severe (8 through 10) comet appeared and\none had sufficient funds but not sufficient time to get protection it made\nsense to use funds to buy insurance rather than risking a big loss.\n\nAlso, getting protection early was the key\nsince protection carries over from one level to another but the insurance has to be purchased in every\nlevel, and sometimes twice in the same level in certain situations. For example, if there is a high likelihood of severe damage and there are insufficient funds to purchase the best (75%) insurance, it may be prudent to purchase 50% or even 25% insurance. However, if the situation repeats itself, later while one is at the same level but has funds to purchase the max. (75%) insurance, then one has to pay the full amount again.\n\n \n\nThe one twist to the game I would like to add\nis the trade-off between re-building DAMAGED (perhaps insured) community vs. investing\nin protection at the cost of slower community build out. The reason is that\nthere are three stages of tracking a comet. If a highly severe comet likely to\nhit the community is detected early enough, protective measures can be taken.\nShould there be a lack of time, the insurance can be purchased. However, if\nsuch a comet is detected later in its path, only insurance can be used to\nminimize the loss. Rather than having it as a random event, there should be\nsome option for the player to look at trade-offs between buying insurance and\nsecuring protection – depending where in its path the comet is.",

            "reflection": "It needs to take decisions strategically so as to strike a\nbalance between achieving the prosperity by way of attaining the development  while you have effective risk management in\nplace.  Effective risk management both in\nreality and in the game, it requires preparing in advance  and \ncoping afterwards. Preparation could be made by acquiring knowledge\nabout the comet by way of doing the research, obtaining protection and take\nmeasures to reduce the negative impact of a shock. As the hit is beyond our\ncontrol it is vital that we obtain protection, insurance and do a research\nprior to the shock and coping afterwards which will minimize the overall impact\nof the hit. \n\n Achieving the development and managing risk by using risk management\ntools (protection, insurance, and knowledge) cost valuable resources which are\nlimited. The limited resources needs to be invested wisely among the above mentioned\ndevelopment and risk management activities.\n\n No matter how well the development goals are achieved if\nit had not invested in risk management tools for effective risk management and\ncoping afterwards, it could severely affect the island.\n\n Although obtaining knowledge by way of research,\nincreasing protection and purchasing insurance covers cost valuable resources\nthat could have been invested in the development, it is much cost effective\nthan getting damaged severely by a hit. Therefore it is vital that you have\neffective risk management in place while having sustainable development as the\namounts invested in risk management outweigh the benefits from it.\n\n The preparation for risk could be made by way of obtaining\nprotection, knowledge and insurance. \n\n Knowledge\n\nThe more information available about the risk  better the understanding of the risk and   being\nknowledgeable reduces the uncertainty when confronting risk. It enables better\npreparation for the risk for mitigate the risk.\n\nProtection\n\nProtection help reduce the magnitude and probability of\nthe negative outcome. Protection includes taking actions to prevent a negative\nshock or to minimize the harmful impact of it. \n\n InsuranceInsurance enable transfer resources\nbetween good and bad times.  Insurance\nrecover the loss and rebuild the pods at a lower cost. When the protection\nprovided in insufficient then the insurance help to minimize the shock from the\nadverse effect.\n\n 2\n\nInitially I did less research and invested heavily on\nexpensive insurance covers. Then as the money was tide in to insurance I did\nnot have enough funds to make new pods or upgrade them which made difficult for\nme to achieve the development milestones.\n\n But later I learnt that doing more research is very much\nbeneficial as it gives more time for coping after the hit to minimize the\ndamage. The cost of doing research out weight the benefit of it if the risk is materialized.\nTherefore in subsequent rounds I did research well, increased protecting and at\nthe same time I kept a close eye on the development which enabled me to win to\nthe level 5 of the game.\n\n 3\n\nIt is proposed to reflect the opportunity side of the risk\nin to the game (introduce farming plots, possibility of rain could be\nintroduced) and development targets could be linked to it. \n\nIn reality the knowledge gain from previous research and\nwhat is learnt from a previous disaster are used in many ways( better\npreparation ) when dealing with a similar risk in  future. This idea could be introduced to the game\nby way of having an accumulated research experience which will be useful in\nminimizing the ‘damage%’ in future hits\n\n ",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon is  real time strategy game that teaches how and why risk managment is important for healthy development. To win the game we win, you need to build and upgrade your pods .The role of risk managment in the game was to show how we have to behave and what may happen during development process.   The goal is to try and balance between all of  actions in real time in order to master the game. At the begining we have some money(1000) we can spend on pots, insurance  and protection. At the start i decided i will build as many pots as possible and save many to pay for an insurance. I decided to build 3 pots and buy a most expensive insurance that cover 75% damage. I took this step to take the most expensive insurance because i wasnt sure how big damages might be and how offen there are collisions. With the rest of the money i decided to level up terrain.When the pots were build and i level-up terrain i was watching the comets. When the risk of crash was high i was getting as much knowledge as possible. when the risk was low i was level-up my protection.After any of pots was finished i was upgrading it to be able to get to next level.In short words my tactic was: build a pot, buy insurance, watch comet while pots were being builid. If comet was not on collision course i was levelig up my terrain. And when any of pot was done and i had money i was upgraidng it. this tactis gave me a level 6. Buing insurance gave a result in a long term, observing comets(geting knowledge ) gave a result in a short time.I played game many times, i was trying ot find best tactic. I would reccomend buing insurance (at least 50%) and with the rest of the money build as many pots as possible. then upgrade them. When its being upgraded try to look on comets and decide which may be on a collision course. if there is no , try to level up terrain if there is a high risk to crash try to get as much knowledge as posiible.If i could add one thing that would be a another different risk (like a earth quake). In real life thare are more than one possible risk we have to be prapaered, that would make a game more difficoult and more chalenging.",

            "reflection": "   The idea of such a learning tool is exceptional. When one hears the theoretical part of Risk Management may well develop the impression and idea that at least in personal level this can be achieved easily as we tend to have or -think- that we have, more control over our selves, especially in regarding the risks we take willingly. Yet, post to my experience with Risk Horizon I have changed my mind. I was lucky enough to be born in a country where natural disasters are extremely rage phenomenon and for the bulk part of my life the public sector financial crisis was an \"unknown\" word for me and for my fellow citizens. As a result, when the crisis began affecting the state which I used to live, things changed unexpectedly. Most did not know how to cope with the new facts, or at least not before enough data was collected on how to deal with something never experienced before. On the other hand, for others opportunities arised amidst the crisis, for some as a result of preparation and for others by random chance.       Risk Horizon offers the player the opportunity to invest in an environment which as in reality, poses dangers. Thus, the player willingly (or because he/she has to for survival reasons) takes risks in order to maximize as possible his/her profits. In addition, the player is given tools which aim at enhancing his/hers chances of achieving his/her goals with the minimum input. In the beginning, one focuses on the main danger, the natural disaster which is caused by the impact of the comet. Yet, soon I realized that the comets are only one aspect of the problem. I had to deal as well with time and demand, or at least, this is how I interpreted the problem. Therefore, with time pressure, increasing demand of resources and the danger of going backwards in case of damage in the production line, I struggled six times to reach level 10. I only went halfway experimenting with different combinations of time allocation and resources. Nevertheless, I collected valuable experience. Any investment without first examining most of the risks with which one may confront with is a bad investment. Collecting a variety of data regarding the social, financial, political and climate/geologic aspects of the state or region one invests to is essential. Post to the recognition of the possible risks and threats and the probabilities for those to occur, one has to prepare for the dangers he/she recognized using the available technology to minimize the damage and purchasing an insurance in order to protect his/her assets in case of unavoidable natural or systemic disaster.     Finally, if I could add/change something in the concept of the game, that would be the human factor. That of course would require the whole game it self change. From a game to a simulator. But the idea of recognizing and coping with systemic risks really intrigues me. Thank you for your timeHope you enjoy the MOOC as much as I do.P.S. There is Simulator that has to do a lot with risk management, if you look for it on the internet you may find it. I do not mention the brand or title as I do not know if it is allowed.              ",

            "reflection": "To my point of view,the role of risk management is kind of like a  backup guy to check and monitor always to maintain the whole system goes well,it's an very important role ,a little bit like the government. It has the responsibilities .Knowledge is basic,cause some risks happens we can predicted but but we cant stop it to happen.That's why i found the protection and insurance is so esstential in the whole progress. If natural disaster happens ,the best things we can do is the reduce the damage to the lease level. To react fast is also an  important lesson i learn from the game.No matter what happened ,and how bad is it,we dont have time just check and sorrow,react is the first solution.I kept playing this game until i lost in in the third round,I kind of enjoy playing it.To keep playing it is just like join the knowledge we learned from the course into practice,like we r in the contral of this system and we have responsibility to keep it safe and goes well.If you stop on half way,it's gonna be quite hard to continue the thinking, thinking is very useful in playing this game,we put ourselves into that role and play it with that role, to think not just an individual but someone hold the responsibility and we should think whole .check each step and make sure things go well.The insurance coverage,the community coorperation ,how to maintain the pods ,to raise the level of the pods ,check the risks from outside ,the growing level.AN interesting is that i am learning strategy management at the same time,to combine these two together and put it into practice is interesting.Insurance is the most important part i learned ,,In the game ,I would rather buy the most expence one cause i can cover more ,i am sure i wouldnt do that before in real life ,but now i ;ve changed my mind.ONly when risks happens you know how important insurance is and would rathere devoted more into it.I  think this works not for a country or groups also for individuals. it's remind me and i should consider my owe insurance not just for now and for the future.The community,the community would help a lot when risk happens ,they r much near ,like neighbors. when risks occurs and you need very urgent help ,to find someone near by is very important.  the communities provided the chances of this.When risks occurs ,especially natural disaster, time is life,  to rescue people you need react as fast as you can ,the communities near by offered their help and would save much more lives at that time.To  keep the information sharing,and have certain meeting with the communities is a good way ,you can keep in touch and keep the update ,if some unpredictable happened, may be the communities or your neighbour notice early than you.If there ;s a new vision of the game, i think to connect people who play it gonna be better,like communities.They can sharing information while playing it and keep the update of the going,or if there are group playing,like two or three students can play it together ,it help the team work and coorperation in risk management process.this may need the game more complicated ,you have to management the risk in the game and at the same time ,to discuss and team work with others ,may be your classmate , to make decisions ,to aware each others resonsibility and the whole process of discussion .This is more interesting and we can learn from each other.Cause people play it with diffrent background",

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did\nyou make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge,\nprotection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect\ndevelopment (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe aspects of risk management that were\nhighlighted in this game included choices about the rate of development in the\nface of risk that are only known at a probabilistic level. This means that you\nhad to choose how many pods to build based on the probability of a meteor hit.\nYou could choose to develop faster, but that risked greater destruction if the\nimpact was severe. There is a tradeoff between speed of development the level\nof damage expected. \n\nAs you have limited funds, you also have to\nchoose how to allocated them in terms of spending money on insurance,\nessentially the risk mitigation part of risk management, money spend on\ndevelopment (building more pods) which allows your community to grow faster,\nbecome more profitable and be more robust against shocks, and on research which\nis a  way of gaining knowledge about the\npossible risks, and this allows you to plan more accurately. An example would\nbe that, if, through research, you learned that a meteor had a low chance of a\nhit, you could choose to develop faster rather than spend money on insurance.\nIf, however, you research showed you that a hit was likely to happen and was\nlikely to cause a large amount of damage, it made more sense to buy lots of\ninsurance and slow development to minimize the damage.\n\nIf\nyou played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to\nplay it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did\nyou do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned\nfrom the game?\n\nI played the game twice, and I learnt that\nresearch was very important in accurately assessing the threat from the\nmeteors, and that insurance was very valuable in getting the community up and\nrunning again after a hit had (inevitably) happened. I also learnt that it paid\nto be a little bit cautious in building new pods if you knew a meteor hit was\nlikely to happen. The first time I played the game, I built too many pods\ninitially and then took heavy losses with the first severe meteor hit.\n\nThe\ngame captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine\nyou are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to\nchange or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better\nrepresent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nI think I would give the game a longer\ntimescale. I think many of the risks that the place I live faces (Britain) are\nlong term risks e.g. increases in severe weather like flooding or drought,\ndriven by even more long term effects like climate change. It would be\ninteresting to have a different selection of risks that included chronic risks\nlike an ageing population or disease rather than just acute risks like the\nmeteor strike. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management plays a fundamental role in the game. Risk management played the role of helping to minimize detrimental occurrences and events that pose a threat to your developmental objectives. Risk management is multi-faceted and requires special analysis of the main objectives of the operation. In the game, risk management assisted with ensuring that progress is soundly and safely made with main objectives still being safely pursued.  In the game the first thing that you need to consider is\ndevelopment. This is in fact the primary objective of the game. In real-life\nterms, development represents what an organization is primarily specialized in.\nThis development is also significant in that in the game it increases the rate\nat which your energy levels grow. Therefore, it is important that development\nis prioritized as it is the life-blood of your survival. At the same time, this\ndevelopment needs to be protected, as meteors constantly approach your area and\npose as a risk threat. It is therefore important that you are constantly\nupgrading your developments as this increases the protection of your gains. \n\nSince the meteors pose a threat, it is important to have\nenough information on the meteors in order to reduce the effects of their\nimpact. In order to successfully do this, you need to ensure that information\nis gathered early and as much of it is collected in order to effectively deal\nwith the risk of impact. Also , it is imperative that ALL meteor threats are\nanalysed, even if the probability is small. This is where knowledge plays an\nimportant role in risk management. Knowing ALL information about the threats\nyou face puts you in a better position to deal with those threats.\n\nRisk transfer in the form of insurance, also plays a\ncritical role in reducing the effects of risk. \nAlthough an insured can use insurance as a mitigating factor in order to\nreduce the actual loss should a risk event occur, the actual risk can never be transferred.  As such the risk remains the exposure to the\ninsured.\n\nMany significant choices and trade-offs were made in terms\nof knowledge, protection and insurance. With knowledge, the meteors were\nanalysed based on their probability of impact as well as their severity. The\nhigher the probability of impact, the more research required to reduce the\nimpact of a meteor hit. Also if the severity of the impact is high, then it is\ncritical to protect the development and insure immediately.\n\nAfter the first few times of playing, I realised that\ninsurance is critical. I insured immediately and I ensured that the insurance\nis adequate. The more advanced the game stages were, the more the insurance\nwas, as the effect of a meteor hit became more devastating. Also I realized the\nimportance of information, in that the effects of meteor hits were greatly\nreduced by the amount of research done on the meteors.  The main things learned during the game\nincluded, analysing all potential risks posed and ensure that you are protected\nat all times from impeding threats. I also learned that risk is impossible to\ncompletely avert at all times, hence one needs a strategy to minimize its\ndevastating impact, rather than try to completely eliminate it. \n\nI would perhaps add the element of people or staff. I would\ntry and demonstrate that people also play a role in risk management. I would\nhave a staff consisting of builders and administrators to oversee developments.\nThis angle is critical as it demonstrates the role of people risk in risk\nmanagement and how an poorly managed staff can pose a risk to your\norganization. ",

            "reflection": "1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The game was about the importance of Risk Management in the development of Alora. The community is exposed to potential socks (comets that might hit the water and cause waves) that would suppress development. Just as in the real world, each nation should inevitably confront potential shocks (idiosyncratic or systemic).The role of Risk Management is clearly seen in the game. A balance should be determined between developing the community and preparing for the potential shocks, given a specific set of tools (research, protection, and insurance) and resources. This balance would mean that to obtain one, another should be forgone. I was made to choose whether to utilize all my resources in building/ upgrading pods, spend time on research to acquire knowledge, invest on protection, or invest in insurance. I chose to develop the community progressively, building up a few pods from the start, sacrificing income and investing on protection/ insurance (if the situation permits) at the same time.Preparation for risk affect development immediately during the start of the game. This helped cushion the potential shock caused by the comets. However, during the succeeding levels, I just need to augment my protection with insurance to absorb the damages caused by the comets.2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I made several tries of the game, hoping to beat Level 4 and reach Level 5. I got the hang of it and I did reach the latter. Of course, this entailed changes in strategy in order to move to the higher level. The following is a summary of my choice of strategy: At the start of the game, during the establishment of the community, instead of using all my resources to erect pods and fill all the spaces quickly, I chose to limit my structures (the trade-off would be the fast income generation due to a great number of pods at the start), progressively upgrading them one by one and successively filling the spaces; constantly keeping in mind to increase my protection, research, and buy insurance if the situation permits. This was no easy task since choosing one would mean foregoing an alternative that could bring about an increase in development/ milestones.I learned that while the desire for improvement is strong, the changes needed to bring improvement can entail substantial risk. However, the reluctance to take risk would be more costly in the end. Risk management can help manage the potential downside from taking risk. 3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Personally, instead of comets, I would propose typhoons affecting the agricultural lands and flooding coastal towns in the Philippines. ",

            "reflection": "A risk is an event or condition that if it occurs,it will have positive or negative effects onproject objectives. Risk has two components which were uncertainty and exposure. It is uncertain because it represents future events. It has possibility of occurring greater than 0% and less than 100%. Risk is something that is present in doing any kind of work. Possibility or probability of some kind without which the work could not be fulfilled. Risk is involved in every planned activity whether it is seen or unseen.Risk management is a continuous procedure which should have to be present in every organization in the process of their developments. In this piece of work we look at the definition of risk and its management through which it can be treated well. Disaster is a hard acceptable truth but it could be stopped or chances of its occurrence could be minimize by proper risk management strategies implemented in the place. We look at the case study of BP oil spill disaster why it was happened and what were its catastrophic results and how it could be stopped in future.Risk is driven through two types of factors involved in any organization which were internal factors and external factors. There also four types financial risk, strategic risk, operational risk and hazard risks.Internal factors contributing to financial risk in any organization were liquidity and cash flow while external factors conclude interest rates, foreign exchange and credit risk.Internal factors contributing to strategic risk were organizations research and development strategies whereas external factors were competition, customer changes, industry changes and customer demands. Internal factors contributing to operational risks were accounting controls, information system, recruitment and supply chain. While external factors were regulation, board composition and culture.Risk handlingReduceAcceptAvoidTransferRisk analysisConsequencesoptionsdecision makingRisk AssessmentQuantifyQualifyPrioritiseRisk StrategyPurposeApproachTaskToolsRisk Assessment\nRisk assessment is a process in which risk has been categorized into different parts. It is a careful examination of what could harm in the work place and people around. It also qualifies the measures those should be put in place for reducing the harms. It is the responsibility of every organization that its workers have been protected by the harms caused by its operations. In oil drilling companies those measures should be highly priorities as because of the nature of activity. The risk was major upon the environment and the consequences of the operations mainly lead to big disaster as well as impacted upon the people. Risk assessment is mainly connected to.Once the hazards identified then the later part is to decide what to do with them. Law requires to do everything “reasonable practicable” to protect people from harm. Controlling measures should be in place firstly, so as to avoid the hazard to an extent. Such as trying less risky option, preventing access to hazardous site, organize work to reduce exposure to hazard, issue personal protective equipments, proving welfare facilities.Operational threats: those were caused by disruption in supplies and operations, loss of access to essential assets, failures in distribution of products or materials etc.Reputational threats: these could be arising because of any big failure which results in disaster.Financial threats: Financial risks are risk which comes from business failure, stock market, interest rates, and unemployment.Technical threats: those were related to the technical difficulty comes in the process because of default in technology by any failure. The new advent of technology is also responsible or taken as threat.My game code is E258QGt",

            "reflection": "The first\ntime I played the game I could not get past level 1. After re-reading the\ninstructions, I played four more times, with much better results. I managed to\nget to level five twice and to level six also on two occasions. \n\nIn the\nfirst times I played, I invested a lot in insurance. Then I realized that a\nbetter strategy is to invest more in development, research and protection, especially\nduring the early stages of the game. Insurance is useful at levels 5 and 6,\nwhen a larger number of comets appear with higher impact and probability levels.\nThis aspect can be directly related to everyday life, where it is essential to\nfocus on obtaining accurate information about the potential risks and take\naction to mitigate them, evaluating the decision to purchase insurance in\nspecific circumstances. \n\nWith regard\nto the research activity, I find many similarities with the real world.\nAlthough research in the game is related to collect information about potential\nrisks, I find an interesting relationship with the benefits of carrying out\nscientific and technological research in communities: the results of the research\nactivities are not immediate, and even some research activities will not give\nany concrete results (such as the cases where extensive research is done on a\ncomet that doesn’t hit). However, sustained research activities produce results\nthat translate into significant benefits for the community. \n\nAnother\ninteresting aspect is related to development. I realized that it is important\nto invest in development as soon as possible because these activities sustain the\ngame’s main indicator. The development demand will increase as the game progresses,\nso it's important to achieve a robust development level before reaching levels\n5 and 6. \n\nOverall, I\nthink the game reflects the dynamics that actually take place with respect to\nrisk management. I think it is an interesting exercise that can be related at\ndifferent levels: from the individual, group, organizational, to the regional\nor national perspective. \n\nI think the\ngame is a good way to experiment with the balance between research, prevention\nand insurance. One of the changes that I would integrate to the game would be\nto define different types of activities that could be performed by the\n\"pods\", that is, that the user could select the functions to be\nperformed by different pods (for example if a pod will be a school, a\nproductive enterprise, a research center, etc.). That would pose interesting questions\nregarding development, as for example: what would happen if there are three\nschools, three productive enterprises and no health services? Or what would\nhappen if there are four big productive enterprises but only one\nunder-developed school?",

            "reflection": "Essay on Risk Horizon game1. Regarding the first part\nof the essay, the role of risk management in the game has been revealed as a key task to promote the fate of individuals and families in the virtual world of Alora. In this regard, it has been shown that planning and preparing to address the risks\nis effective to recover from losses and to increase\nbenefits, so it has been demonstrated that the fate of communities can be improved if the risks\nare adequately managed . \n\nSpecifically,\nthe game required to test our risk management in the\nareas of knowledge, protection and insurance. On knowledge, the game required to understand the changes that happened\nwhen a meteorite impacted the world of Alora and\ncaused flooding. \n\nRegarding the knowledge, the game required to understand the perturbations caused by meteorites, as\nwell as internal and external conditions, and possible outcomes on housing and facilities in order to reduce uncertainty. \n\nAs for protection, it was necessary to reduce the probability and\nmagnitude of losses in housing and facilities, and also to learn\nto increase economic benefits to maintain growth and tackle the material losses caused by meteorites and floods.\n\n\nRegarding insurance, the game has demonstrated the usefulness of\nthis financial resource to recover from\nlosses and to obtain\ngreater advantage of  benefits. It has\ndemonstrated the desirability of\ninsurance, helping to overcome losses,\nto maintain purchasing power and also to keep pace with growth. \n\nFor these reasons, the game has allowed\nme to learn that preparing for\nthe risk definitely affects development, because if individuals\nand communities do not acquire knowledge of the risks, they are not protected\nand are not insured, it will be much harder for them to recover from disaster, to rebuild their lives and to keeping a positive development.\n\n\n2. Regarding the second\nquestion, I have played the game more\nthan once and I can say I've changed my\ngame from the first time. In that sense, the first few times I tried to\naccumulate knowledge to understand how\nthe game worked and to decide which were the best choices to ensure the welfare of households and to achieve\nadequate profit. Thus, in the first games I tried to understand how the various risk management components interacted.As I was playing, I was understanding how the game worked and I was learning that\ngood risk management require\nproper preparation, that is, knowledge,\nprotection and be insurance. \n\nWith this, the main thing I have learned in the game has been that risk management pretends reducing losses and increasing profits when confronting\nand taking risks. So, risk management should\ntry to get minimum possible losses after a flood and, for this,\nthe best option is to have adequate risk insurance. Moreover, the\nreduction of losses can increase profits because it has more resources to devote to the benefit and development of individuals and the community. \n\n3. Finally, with regard to the third question, in the event that the game developers set up a new version of the game, I\nwould introduced a set of custom risks, according to the\ncountry of residence of the student. For example, according to the World Development Report 2014, in East Asia and in South America I would include the risk from natural disasters, while in other regions I would include, among others, the risk against large recessions, maternal mortality or homicides.\n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "       The main idea behind the game is the use, unknown by the player, of concepts of risk management. During the game, you have to invest in knowledge, protection and insurance, and still save wealth to develop your civilization. If you invested too much time in protection, your civilization would not grow and be richer. If you invested only in development and new construction, you would lack in protection and would be more fragile to shocks (asteroids in the game). If you invested only in knowledge, you would spend all your time observing and not acting. And, at the end, if you do not invested in insurance, anytime your planet could be affected by a shock stronger than your defenses could handle, and you would spend a lot of money fixing things up.        Knowing this, it is easy to observe that the optimal configuration will be a combination of all the things said till now. During the game, you have to balance between these options of investments to be strong against shocks, and still be able to develop and catch your goals.        At a first glance, you could say that investing in protection is a bad idea, watching that your civilization will be stucked, but playing a few times, you would see the importance of this investment when facing an inevitable shock. The same thing for insurance, when you think that it is a lot of resource going on a thing that will protect you in a possible case of damage, while you 'should' be using this money in infrastructure to grow.       Still, should be highlighted the importance of conections and acess to knowledge of other people. Sometimes, you are having a problem that happened before and some people handled well that time. In the game, we can see this in the case where the more you observe and obtain knowledge about the risk, more time you have to get informations in other communities and prepare yourself for the incoming shock.       The game is a simplified version of playing with risk management, but would be nice if it had more options of risks, and more ways to prepare yourself for then. With this, could be added a 'memory', a 'know how' about the problem you just confronted. This would simulate the real life better, because today in the world, we can observe that when a shock affects a country, the next time that the same shock occurs, the country is better prepared for it, and it has way less impact in the country, reducing the damage caused, like live losts..",

Certain things cannot be insured. Protection requires lot of resources and also time. Striking a balance between these three was a challenge.2) I have played the tutorial version multiple times before actually playing the game. I have played the game more than once but could not succeed. Both the times I played differently. i.e, First time i was taking maximum risk and invested minimum in the research. In the second time and third time I invested Insurane and protection respectively. But still I could not succeed. I feel the balance should be striked between all the three. 3) I feel the protection i.e, the elevation part the consumption of resources for elevating the island is consuming the disproportionate amount which can be revisited. Further one aspect which I feel to add with respect to my local area is floods and drought condition may also be added to the game.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game involved research on possible threats while at the same time building a community. The choices I made at the beginning of the game to 1. buy insurance  and 2. build protection, based on the severity of  the incoming threat. This trade off meant that I was not able  to build the community at a faster rate to generate wealth. I found that there was a diminishing rate of return from protection, particularly when the threat was severe. I also learnt that the severity of risk did not always equate to the size of the damage. While playing in Level three, I found that it was very difficult to generate wealth in the community.  While investing large sums in the community, the rate of return on investment was slow. \n\nI played the game numerous times to try out different strategies. I tried just buying insurance and building a community as quickly as possible. Sometimes this worked, other times it didn't as it didn't generate significant wealth. I tried buying protection and building a community only. This was the least successful strategy as the cost of repairs was prohibitive. I found the combination of buying some insurance, some protection, and building the community with the available resources to be the most successful strategy.\n\nThe main thing I learnt from the game was to assess risk as soon possible to monitor its severity as it crossed the screen, and try to prepare for it with the resources available I also learnt that there was a limit to the amount of protection that could be purchased that offset some of the effects of the damage caused by the comets. \n\n\n\nI live in an earthquake-prone part of my country. I would tweak the game by omitting the comets and introducing earthquakes. The aim of the game would be to build a rise high rise building, built to withstand a 7.7 earthquake on the Richter Scale through six rounds of the game. Each round of the game would involve building three levels. Resources available would include cash for property development - complying with current regulations and building standards, property insurance, and property protection in the form of  purchasing base isolators,  allowing the building to sway in an earthquake. The rate of return upon Investment into the building would increase expediently. Earthquakes will roll underground  across the screen, at various depths and severity, monitored by a seismic recorder, which will let you know the severity of the quake.  The timeline for building each floor, and the amount of money available will be similar to the comet game. The one thing I would include in the game is an evacuation strategy to be included in the build. As earthquakes occur at any time, such a  strategy is essential. \n\nThe winner has built a safe and secure six-storied building, that will withstand a 7.7 earthquake on the Richter Scale.",

In addition, there's option to purchase the insurance to decrease the damage once the planet is hit. Also, doing more research can help you predict the severity of the hit and chance of hit more precisely and in that way can help you protect your pods in a better way.The choice I make is to create multiple pods, and upgrade them when the capital is enough. Also, the trade-off will be spending the time doing the research and developing the pod. And the insurance will cost term amount of capital, and it's also a trade off.Preparation for the risk can to some degree increase the recovery once the comet has hit the planet.2. I played multiple times, and the difference was to change the sequence of doing the development of pod and doing the research. I think, the strategy is very important during the game.3. I would say, I'd like to have more option to control the damage once the comet has hit the planet. And may be there could be more options for insurance.",

            "reflection": "Minimizing\nDamage Via Risk Management\n\nRisk\nmanagement was essential for reducing the repair costs or having no repair costs.\nI chose to invest on protection most of the times and tried not buying\ninsurance. However, when damage occurred, recovering was very costly. Thus I\nunderstood that insurance was a necessity. \n\nI always\nchecked the meteors. According to the severity level of the comets, I focused\non research; the more the level of severity, the longer the research duration. \n\nThe\ndecision on buying an insurance depended on the number of the highly severe\ncomets. If I saw more than one at the same time, I bought insurance. However, I\ncould not figure out which insurance option to buy according to the severity of\nthe comets. \n\nI played\nthe game more than once and what I did different than the first one was that a\ngreat effort for a head start. I invested more to growth and upgrades together\nwith the protection. I tried to make upgrades towards to end of each round in\norder to save time. \n\nWhat I\nlearned was that if we can see the risk and the risk is inevitable, buying\ninsurance is the best way to cover the damage.  However, in order to reach optimum benefit, we\nneed to observe the risk carefully that we could interpret if the risk results\nin damage or not. Thus, we can save money while we are protecting ourselves. \n\nTo sum up,\neven in a simple game it is really hard to manage all the possibilities to lead\na \"no damage\" result. Thus, planning and foreseeing the risk is very\nimportant. The damage can be too hazardous to recover from and hence can lead\nto ultimate loss. We need to protect ourselves from the risk. We need to\nobserve the risk and we need to prepare for the risk. The cooperation in order\nto cure the damage, helping each other after the damage is also essential for\nreducing the cost of the damage. Insurance in the game was expensive actually\nhowever when it is compared with the cost of damage, Insurance was the best way\nto cover repair costs. In this context, game was fine in its current condition\nand I have not got any comments to add on to the gameplay. ",

I learned that research is essential to reach the next\nlevel, and the insurance is best purchased from the knowledge of the more\nimmediate risk of potential disasters. Prepare for the risk decreased the\nchances of learning from mistakes, which can be very costly, so the advantages\nof cost-effective Risk Management.After learning I could prepare myself to do what was most effective at each level. On the third level we need to be more aware of the risk of natural disaster, as the imminence of the threat is directly related to the time and disaster recovery. It is important to know the importance of measures at all times, if a more expensive insurance is more important than investing in development at any given time. Find a balance.\n\n2) What did\ndifferent was more accurate way of measuring what was needed to do first to\nreach the next level. And know how to wait for the right moment to make a\ndecision. Decisions improve with errors, although not the best option in a real\nsituation.I used better the time to think what to do, because in a situation of risk we tend to feel threatened and make decisions irrationally, which means we learn to better control our emotions to counter a threat. Insecurity and uncertainty are major threats to risk management. In the game you can clearly see the importance of risk management as a tool to prevent, and the importance of prevention. We should warn us, not for us to pay with lives.3) Other people. As seen in the 2008 crisis, corruption and mismanagement and embezzlement show us that human factors are critical even when we talk about natural hazards, as all measures for risk management, people are involved in these situations and many fraudulent opportunities are open. This is precisely because in a situation of risk people are more vulnerable and others can take advantage of this fake opportunity to explore others.So it would be interesting to have a game where there is interaction with other people, where the decisions of others influence our decisions and also the development of our city.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was to combine knowledge (comet research), protection (insurance), externals (community development) to achieve prosperity and make coping with shocks possible. The choices I made were how to build with one eye on developing and fortifying pods while comets threatened to wipe out any progress made.Thankfully, the 75% insurance available for purchase made quick repairs possible although I'm well aware in many parts of the world is not a viable option. I played the game multiple times and realized that the pods themselves could be made stronger with more investment.The main things I learned were:. Insurance helps you recover ground quickly and then provides capital to fortify structures further.. Community is useful for coping and reduces coping time. Building and research must balance each otherThe funds surprisingly were available soon after a shock. In reality, funds are not so readily available. Perhaps something introducing savings would be helpful.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management is that there is a trade off between different ways to prepare or protect against risks. Knowledge is a powerful source, but without protection, it is not worth a lot. Same the other way around, you can protect all you want but without proper knowledge, it is not worth as much if you would combine them. Insurance appeared to be the one with the least impact. Interesting that you cannot build protection while gaining knowledge, which is possible in the real world. During the game (I played it several times) I changed my strategy. The first time I started to invest lots of money only in protection. Even to a level of protection which was insane. I wanted the highest level of protection. But then I found out that without knowledge, the city is still damaged a lot. So then I knew I needed to change my strategy. The second time I first invested in a fair amount of protection, as a quick fix and immediate relief, and then focus more on the knowledge part, the long term solution. During the time I followed a comet, I made sure the houses were upgraded if there was money available. Then it is a challenge to keep those balanced: sometimes focus on the knowledge, sometimes on protection and sometimes on building more resilient houses. This helped me to complete level 4. However, I did not reach level 5 with this strategy, so maybe there is a better way. Anyway, the game shows perfectly you need to combine the different risk management factors.For me the most important thing missing is the incentive-factor. I think it plays a big role in if and where to spend money on/invest money in. The government certainly doesn't always care that much, because it does not affect them personally. Especially in countries where there is a huge gap between the poor and rich, the ones that live with great risks and the ones that make the decisions for everyone else. This point will however be impossible to integrate into the game without making it too complex.Personally I found it weird that knowledge does not cost any money in the game (right?). Were I live, research costs lots of money. This is one of the reasons why not everyone wants to invest in knowledge. You need to invest the money in something you don't know exactly how big the benefit will be. Protection is more hands on, quick fix, but will not suffice in the end. So one thing I would change is that research also costs money. Then you have a real challenge: focus on the long term while a city is potentially in danger, or focus on the short term and trying to minimize damage for the rest of time. ",

            "reflection": "Good night , my name is Vanessa Beltran, I’am Colombian, I apologize if my English is not drafting in technical enough. This game was very interesting because show, how we can manage the risk in few seconds, and bring me the opportunity to learn how important is take the best decisions for have the best outcomes. the manage of risk is an important element inasmuch as one person that don't have the ability to averts setbacks, handle stressful situations or face consequences sometimes this can represent a major disaster. \n\nAt the game that risk was always a permanent element and one bad decision will represent lost the game and in the real life millions of died and lost of important resources, the risk of  take one plan of action and this don't be successful represent that the investigation and the prepare in advance had fails.\nThe preparation had a determinant effect, when i am prepared for the meteorite impact, the consequence and the  damage was minimum, sometimes with out damage, but in the measure that the prepared was bad, after time the game over, because don't have good outcomes the actions that I take. This situation represent the importance of investigation and knowledge for prepare one plan of coping a threats and unexpected risks, when we don’t examine what we are facing the risk of fail, increases.\n\nIn the next time that I play the game, I will pay more attention in the investigation, and I will take more conscious decisions because sometimes I used my intuition for develop a strategy for win, I don't prepared a plan and in some moments I lost a lot of time thinking what was the best option, but my answer was incorrect, and in many opportunities I can't pass the second level.\n\nI would add more options for answer the situation for example the power to diverting or safely remove the meteorite; it will cost more money but is a new option that can represent no damage to the infrastructure and the people. The chance of hit is based in preventive measures and this options bring this option and some settings for the form and construction of the infrastructure is necessary, for win the game.\n\nThis game show me in what aspects I fail and how the use of new strategies with knowledge, preventative measures , and good resource management make the difference in win or lost the opportunity of development. \n\nThanks.

            "reflection": "I did not understand how to increase the Research points in the game - which in real life is essential in order to prepare for risks. I tried to develop the society as soon as possible, because higher development rate reduces the damages caused by meteors when they hit. I also always aimed for the highest possible level of insurance in order to save costs of damages if they occur. Preparation for risks slows down development, but on the other hand if the meteor hits the community and damages happen, they slow down as well. The main things I learned from the game are: important to invest in development of the society, however not on the cost of risk-preparedness. Insurance in the game plays a big role, which I'm not sure is the case in real life. I played the game four times, on the fourth time I tried to invest in fewer number of settlements but instead develop them as fast as possible. I also learned that if the level of preparedness is too high in comparison to the level of risk of the meteors, the investment is wasted. If I would develop a new version of the game, I would put more attention to the research-component, and also invent different kinds of risks (not only meteors) in order to raise awareness of variety of possible risks hitting communities. In the current version the income is created quite easily - this should be more challenging.",

You could to this bytaking insurancecreate bondsbuild on a higher groundprotecting to reduce damagein case of damage repair as soon as possible of a risk and to manage the damage by insurance , bonds or to build on a higher level.I started the game with ( the highest) insurance(on higher levels i discovered that i couldn't reach a higher level by to much damage). To build as much as possible and at the same time get knowledge  of the comets (risks), Furthermore to bring the land on an higher level to decrease the risk and in case of an event reduce the damage. I learned later that on the first level you don't have to put much emphasis on insurance until there is high risk.  Getting information about the level of the risk of the comets.My tactic was to get insurance build as much as possible creating connections. For the higher levels The changes that i would consider is already applied. I live in a polder (thus on a seabed) Its very importantly to protect us against the water. So we have to have good dikes. I think the raising of the land already captures this. it would be double or unnecessary to also apply dikes.",

Time is a crucial variable in this matter, as in the real life.\n\nWhat I\ntried in the game was to invest as much as possible in research and in\ninsurance. I understood also that when your civilization is very developed you\nneed to invest more to rebuild it.\n\nIf playing\nagain I would invest a bit more in protection to check if in that way I could\nget better results. I only got level 2.\n\nOf course\nis a very simplified model but, well, models are models!! The main drawback of\nthe game/model is that is based in probabilities/weightings that could be\ndifferent in the real life. \n\nIn order to\nimprove the game I would include different types of risk (with different\neffects). I know that in fact that is modeled by the different meteors (with\ndifferent probabilities, effects, etc.) but I think that a different visual\nrepresentation would help people to understand that it is needed to take care\nof different risks at the same time.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Although I greatly enjoyed playing, I found the risk management game much more difficult than I had originally anticipated. Previous to playing I thought I was able to make safe, rational decisions which would benefit in the long term. However, despite being a very cautious person and being fully informed on the future risks posed by the meteorites I still failed to adequately protect my city from and prepare them for risks.My first few games ended quickly with my buildings being destroyed through a lack planning and running out of funds because I had not insured them against these risks. Nevertheless on my third attempt I provided my buildings with greater levels of insurance which both reduced the levels of damage and lowered the costs of recovery. I also started to better appreciate how researching and being informed on the risks- meteorites- allowed me the benefit of 'lifting' the ground when necessary thus further reducing damage.The main challenges I faced when trying to apply successful risk management were budgeting and multi-tasking. Firstly, when taking into consideration the limited funds it was difficult to strike the right balance between building structures and preparing them for and from future shocks. The difficult decisions and forced compromises provided really strong examples of the issues faced by governments, communities and individuals when considering risk management. Secondly, the game also successfully illustrated the difficult balance of considering conflicting priorities. For example the development of the buildings and community whilst also ensuring it was adequately protected against and prepared for risks. If I were to play the game again I would firstly plan ahead before starting, take out at least a mid-level insurance and gradually build my community. Given my previous experiences I now appreciate the importance of research and therefore would assess each meteorite, establishing when one poses a risk and consequently 'lifting' the community when necessary to minimise damage thus reducing the cost of recovery. This reflects the importance of communities or governments both being aware of potential risks but also acting accordingly and taking on required protective actions and insurance. Through these precautions one can achieve long term security against risks.In conclusion, I felt the game highlighted the issues associated with risk management, most notably remembering the long term whilst seeing the immediate growth. Also I gained a greater appreciation of the benefits of preparing through risk management became really apparent, understanding and recognising risks and the benefit of insurance. ",

            "reflection": "The main idea of the game is based on the two essential objectives of Risk Management which are produce resilience by preventing disasters to be out of control and achieving prosperity by continuing in construction process. So the role of risk management is clearly covered through making the player confront risks of both hitting the village and bankruptcy.the most important choices are when several risks appear in space. In such cases I primary rely on research measure to build a base knowledge about the most influential risk and the most urgent one to provide the appropriate protection so I can reduce the losses and increase the benefit.The more research I have, the more time I will have to make community connections before a shock hits, so the more protection I can gather.However, I preferred preparing for risk by protection more than depending on insurance in order to use money in invest the limited time by build more pods as long as I have enough protection which allows the village to face dangerous risks. But I used the insurance in case there was not enough time to prepare, and also to be quicker and cheaper to rebuild my pods when the comets damage.Fortunately we have enough resources to cover costs of preparation in contrast of some developing countriesActually, I played this game many times,First I don't know how to win or what the point of this game, but after many time playing I realized that I need to build and upgrade my pods.These help my meter fill faster, and reach my goal in time. I can build many pods at once as long as I have the resources for it.The goal is to try and balance between all of these actions in real time in order to master the game.And I know that research by having a comet selected and the telescope window open is another way I can prepare for incoming shocks if the protection slider begins to cost too much money. The more time I spend with the comet selected, the more research I will collect. but this takes away time I could spend doing other actions. Its all about balancing.Also, when I purchase an insurance plan, I am protected for the rest for the round. Damaged growers will be cheaper depending on the plan I buy. Each round the plan's will increase in cost, reflecting the amount of development I have done.so the point of this game is, you must keep in mind when you are attempting to balance preparing for comets and reaching your goal before time runs out.If my task is to developing a new version of the game, I will create something to represent the internal condition of the place that I live, not only focus on the external environment, so I can prepare more for the risk, also I will create a modern technology of building in very low cost, this idea simulates the opportunities that may able to gain.",

            "reflection": "I only managed to progress past level\none once in the first hour of play, though I had thought that I had\nunderstood the tutorial; and I never managed to get passed level 4. While I discovered new techniques\neach time through, I was not able to find the right balance between\nresearch on the meteors, protection (by means of lifting the\ncommunity away from the waves) and development (which seems to have a\nrelationship with building the pods, but that relationship is not\nexactly direct). I also could not figure out if I should be focusing\non number of pods, or the extent to which they were upgraded. Toward\nthe end, I was focusing on smaller numbers of further upgraded pods,\nand I'm really not certain that I was getting anywhere with that\nstrategy.\nI noticed that preparation for risk\ntook a very long time, cost money, and held the development meter\nrelatively flat. Upgrading pods also did not seem to have much of an\neffect on the development meter. On the other hand, research on the\nmeteors advanced the development meter considerably, but even with\ninsurance it was difficult to bounce back after an impact that was\nnot protected against. Without insurance, the cost of repairing the\ndamage to the pods was extremely prohibitive. Even when I simply chose\nto purchase insurance at a slightly lower level, the cost of repairs\nwere so much more difficult to keep up with.\nI found that the rate at which the\nmeteors hit seemed unrealistic. That said, it is possible that\nit was proportional to the sped up rate of building and upgrading the\npods. In relation to the speed of protection progress, however, the\nmeteors seemed to come at a very high frequency. Though, this did change if I reloaded the page.\nIf I were to play again, I think that I\nwould focusing on building a larger number of pods, rather than\ntrying to upgrade them extensively. I think, also, that I would\ndedicate more time to increasing protection of the pods. I certainly\nwould not, even make the mistake of not buying the top level of\ninsurance.\nIf I were to create my own version of\nthis game, I think I would create something that was a bit “closer\nto home.” While the space pods were intriguing, I would would base\nthe town on a community on earth, so that the results of the players\nactions would translate more easily to real life situations. Also, I\nthink that I would make it such that the player could engage in\nmultiple tasks at once. In a real society, it is possible to work\nsimultaneously on protection measures, research and building. I might\nalso have research cost money, as I don't think I remember it having\nan associated cost in this game.\nOverall, I would say that I enjoyed the\ngame, and found it to be quite educational. I would certainly be\nwilling to play a more expanded version of the game (that would allow\nthe player to make more specific choices as to which protection\nmeasures to take, how much of the budget to invest in each area:\nbuilding, research and protection, etc), if such a version were to be\nreleased. I have enjoyed games such as the Half the Sky Facebook\ngame, and Plan It Green in the past. I really do see the value and\npotential of this type of game in its ability to familiarize a wide\naudience, including young people, with risk management concepts. I am\nexcited to see what may come of this idea!",

            "reflection": "To progress steadily through each level, it is important to upgrade each  every built pod at least once within the level.  This is not possible if one overspends upon defence measures, but if a comet strikes and the player is uninsured, the collective damage will impede development and prohibit progression.Something that is crucial to eventually complete the final level is to, \nat the very start of the game, focus on upgrading a small number of pods\n from Level 1 to Level 2, before filling up all of the empty plots with individual pods.  In \ngame terms, this might seem obvious as it costs less to upgrade from the\n base level than it does to build a new pod from nothing.  But I think \nthis neatly reflects the significance of a 'perfectionist' strategy \nversus an 'expansionist' strategy in development  risk management.Each defence strategy comes with its own distinct risk attached.  Research is a preparedness strategy, not a preventative one, and also represents the risk of human fallibility- maximum research may still yield incorrect findings.  Insurance comes at a high cost, despite the fact that it may never be used.  Physical defence measures, as represented by the raising of the land, are a great drain upon finances, and a balance must be struck to prepare a suitable minimum level of protection, which the player may improve upon by later establishing 'community connections'.An insurance policy should not be taken out until about midway through the game, at which point the level of development that one has attained effects several factors that make insurance worthwhile.  Firstly, the increased burden of damaged incured by pods of Level 3 or above, if not offset by a progressively higher insurance plan, will obliterate any hope of reaching the targets in standard of development.  Secondly, highly developed pods will increase earnings, so that beyond the further upgrade to each pod, a surplus will be generated large enough to cover the cost of the insurance policy.I think it is important to focus research efforts on those comets with a greater severity, rather than those with a greater chance of impact.  I recall a story told by a great computer-game designer, Sid Meier, who was responsible for the Civilization series of strategy games.  He spoke of when he set up his first games-design company, with a business partner who was an ex Air Force pilot.  Together, they had competed on an early, arcade-style Flight Simulator game.  Sid Meier beat the former pilot, because he recognised how the game mechanics differed from the flight mechanics that his competitor was used to.  I felt that the same was true of Risk Horizon, in that on occasion the risk mechanics were overshadowed by the game mechanics that were attempting to emulate them.  For me, the most incongruous element of the game was that element which represented 'community connections'.  Whereas all of the other game elements relied upon abstract decision-making, 'community connections' was an element of practical skill, and if one is a good gamer, it is possible to reach a level higher than that which reflects one's quality as a decision-maker.  But perhaps this was deliberate, to represent what the game designers consider to be the greater importance of community connections over physical defence measures  third-party insurance policies.An aspect that I would add to represent risk management choices in my country would be to somehow penalise the earnings of a player who accumulates too great a surplus of funds, therefore dimishing marginal utility, rather than allocating them effectively to furthering development or inhibiting damage/risk.",

On the other hand, I realized that a comet without an\nappropriate insurance could cause a harmful damage in my village so I had to\nfind the correct balance between these two situations.\n\n  I played twice although eventually I almost\nget addicted. The first time I played I run out of time because I paid for the\nhigher insurance and that had got a high cost of opportunity for my village\ndevelopment.\n\n The second time, there was a comet that caused\na little disaster in my village despite of my level of insurance and protection\nbut it was just only one comet and by a short difference between my degree of insurance\nand the damage that caused, so I believe I get a very realistic simulation\nbecause I think that we are never protected for all kind of shocks in a hundred\npercent level.\n\n At last I tried to do constantly things, I\nmean, first of all get the minimum insurance and afterwards I tried to develop\nmy pods as much as I could at the same time I researched the comets and\nregulate the bar and insurance level for the appropriate protection according\nto my researches.  That was the best way\nthat I found to be correctly protected and insured at the same time.\n\n  The game is very funny and very simple to play\nand I think you can learn some basics about principal components in risk\nmanagement, so if I had to improve something, I think I would make some kind of\nshelters apart in the development of the village. I would penalize more the\ndevelopment without adequate shelters for the size of the population, measure by\nthe number of pods. Trying to show the idea watched on videos about Chile’s and\nHaiti earthquakes and the different damage caused by these disasters measure in\nhuman life quantity. Maybe this could make more understandable the\nimportance of human life over pod development.\n\n In summary it is a good game that let you to\nunderstand the key points of risk management and that the good balance between\nthese points is a powerful weapon to fight versus any shock. ",

            "reflection": "1 - My choices and their effectsThe risk management allowed the civilization to evolve and prosper even in an environment of quite frequent disasters. My priority was to build and upgrade pods as much as possible to generate more credit - to be able to build protection and buy insurance. I always tried to be prepared for upcoming threats (comets) but in the end of the game (L6), reparations afterwards were the only thing I was able to do, since the occurrence of disasters was more and more higher. Having appropriate protection and doing research allowed me to cope with the aftermath better. The big role (maybe bigger than I would expect) played the insurance - having the highest level of insurance was usually the key factor of efficient coping with the impact of the comet (at least in my type of playing).2 - Main things learnedI played several times. I learned to understand the threat (learning about comet types) and use available information in order to be able to assess the threat and the minimal protection needed what helped me to stop over-protect my world (what was my biggest repeated failure at the beginning) and, hence, save the credit for the insurance, build more pod capacity so I had  more time for research. I also learned that timing was very important - or maybe more specific, managing the cash-flow was important to be able to build, upgrade and have time to research (and buy insurance). I learned to prioritize and act quickly. I was unable to determine whether it was better to build less pods but more upgraded (more expensive with increasing upgrades) or more pods less upgraded (harder to quickly repair after the hit, less productive). I was also surprised how big role the insurance played - I guess that the parallel would be that after the shock, money can provide the most effective coping since they can be transformed in (almost) any help/coping instrument necessary. In game, the recovery from disaster was more easier with insurance than it would be without it. I was not able to test whether it was better to go for any available insurance at the beginning and then buy the more expensive one (hence to build basics for improvement) or to wait until I had enough credit to buy the highest insurance (to safe money). The most interesting observation was that it was very hard for me \"read\" game behaviour and adjust my strategy according to it - I failed several times with one same strategy until I decided to change it. Actually, the longer I played, the worse game results I got. I guess I forgot to keep it simple and tried to make my strategy too complex. 3 - Tips for game improvementI would prefer to be able to test and experiment with particular sub-systems of the whole world. When I had an idea to update my strategy I had to start all over and other systems interfered with the one subsystem I wanted to test. It is like having the opportunity to train separately backhands and forehands in tennis before training them in a game. I would also welcome more information about the outcome of my strategy at the end, so I would be able to think about its upgrade.​ During increasing my protection, I would also welcome to see the progress of its increasing, and not only the drop of my credit.",

            "reflection": "First of all It is a useful , applicable , good game .. i found the enough example in understanding of risk managment , which had the big role in winning the game , by the effective Scientific using of researches , protection button and trade-offs i could protect my self from the comets..in our world's firms we could apply all of these components to protect our businesses and make it able to face risks, threats, and other outside conditions. in our life there are many kinds of shocks (famine, floods, economic collapse...) all of  these we could face if we really apply what we learned from the game.while playing and when i gave the researches long time, i had the enough time with community connections so it helped me in long term protection  and insuranceconnected Neighbors  and community organizations help one another when a shock comesby sharing resources forming and sustaining . So the role of risk management is so clear through making the player confront risks. the most important choise must be taken when more than one comet appears in this case i spent some time on research to build some knowledge then i came back to the protection button to make the ability of protection larger than the damage that would happen if the comet hits me and it works .. when it hits me  i use the community connections and in a few time it says (NO DAMAGE).the main idea of the role of risk management in the game is about keep building and upgrading of pods even when the player is protecting or doing researches so the business must be continued even under the risks.when i played the game for the first time i didn't understand everything , i didn't had the enough knowledge of how to be safe from risks.. so i started with tutorial version and i repeat it more than once til i understand every thing about bulding , protecting and the coordinating between them, and this explains what i learned from the game about this coordinating between protecting ,keeping my business on, and doing researches, another thing i leaned is about the right using of time and resources in confront of the risk.when i think about developing the game i have tow ideas the first is increasing the threats that the player face such as existing another Aloras which are bulding and developing pods and gaining a lot that will reflect the risk of having  competitors and how i must play to be better than them, the second idea is to limit the resources and the money that i could use to protect my self so that will offer a good knowledge about using a limit buget to face a larg risk.",

            "reflection": "In terms of knowledge i did some research, as for protection I was lifting up the surface. In terms of insurance I was using an insurance policy covering 75% of the damage that was being done. I have played the game for a few times, and every time I learn something new, firstly I didn't know about the research, and after the first time when I only did some insurance, I have starting doing some research also. The next couple of times besides insuring and researching I have learned to do some protection also, which included lifting up the surface of the planet so that when the meteor hit it would not cause a lot of damage to my objects. Every next time that I played the game, I firstly went researching after that protection and if it is not enough than I also insured my property. It payed of really well. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management game was to show that risk can be reduced and costs can be balanced through proper prediction, assessment, research, preparation, and mitigation. Two basic choices to make was to invest in development and in protection of the community. However, there were also some smaller dilemmas; for example, should I spend time raising the terrain to mitigate the result of the asteroid / comet impact or should I spend time preparing the community by conducting research that would give me extra time to prepare the community response. Also, there were choices which path of development should I follow: whether I should develop more capsules / modules on a lower level of development, or should I focus on developing and upgrading 3 or 4 modules to higher levels. Therefore, the game was all about choices and dealing with the consequences of those decisions.I have played the game multiple times. The first time, I was able to reach level 3, but during my consecutive tries, I was failing to go through level 2. Eventually, I discovered that I was playing too safe and that I was not spending enough resources on development by the beginning of each level. Then, when I tried to balance costs of development and protection (insurance, safety by raising terrain, and rebuilding), immediately I was more successful and I reached level 4 (or was it level 5 ?). However, I learned that at one moment, I was spending too much money on development, and if I was hit by a comet, I would have no money to rebuild the settlement. I was left with maybe 20 dollars and, despite having the insurance on the level of 75% payback, I would still have to have to cover 25% of the cost of rebuilding the community. Thus, the game taught me the importance of balancing between investing in development and in dealing with potential natural disasters. If I was to change one element of the game to make it better represent the risk management choices, I would try to make it more realistic and relevant. For instance, instead of taking place on a faraway planet, the game should take place somewhere in a developing country such as Bangladesh. There instead of meteors / comets, the player could be dealing with annual monsoons and other rains that could destroy the crops and endanger people's lives. Placing the game in such environment and context would make more sense in discovering what choices people in some place of the world have to make.",

            "reflection": "I did not realize it was going to be so challenging\nand versatile.\n\nThe game even showing imaginary planet is just the\nright description of the Earth problems.\n\nAt the beginning I tried faster growth along with\nhigher insurance levels which in case of a shock led to severe damages and made\nme start all over. Then I tried slower progress with more attention to the\nprotection and monitoring the comets. As a result I minimized the damage,\ncaused by the shocks, reduced insurance and achieved slower but more stable\ngrowth. Monitoring comets helped for better predicting of the potential damage\nand planning resources for protection. The earlier I spotted the “harmful comet”,\nthe better I could prepare for it. As we know collecting more data makes\nestimations more precise (Law of Large Numbers).\n\nThe Insurance helped me to minimize and recover faster\nfrom losses, although I found protection more useful.\n\nAlso when I had some time left after reaching the\nrequired level of development I tried to spend it raising the surface and\nstrengthening the protection. It helped reduce loses and make development\nsmooth in the next Level. This was some king of transferring spare resource (time\nto build protection) over time.\n\nThrough the levels the money was no longer an issue –\nthe further you go, the more you get. The only problem was saving the progress\nin a limited period of time. So the time remained big issue and it became more\nand more difficult to control and plan! Therefore it was critical to do your\nbest in protecting the progress achieved. Even thought better protection made\nthe growth slower it improved resilience and allowed to avoid the damage\nor to recover faster.\n\nIt appears that the balance is crucial.\nGrowth is in one hand and protection is in the other. Even if you think you\nhave enough resources and time – one “strike of meteorite” can bring you back\nto the beginning. Therefore it is important to pay enough attention to the protection\nand monitor the scene along with constructing. After reaching a higher level of\ndevelopment the insurance becomes very important. Because repairing of many\nupgraded houses costs really a lot (more than 75% insurance for 4 stages all\ntogether)! So the further you go the more attention you should pay to the\ninsurance. And when the \"black day\" comes it all pays off! \n\n \n\nIn the place where I live there are no so many natural\ndisasters to be afraid of luckily. One of the biggest issues remains short living\nexpectancy 62 for men and 74 for women along with retirement age of 60 for men\nand 55 for women. More over the amount of the state pension is very small (around\n200$ for pensioners). \n\nThe main issues are: \n\n1) For both men and women it is crucial to make savings\n(investment insurance or simply investing) during the active period of live and\nliving healthier life to get the benefits after the retirement. Unfortunately\nthere is too little or no financial education among population and a very small\npercentage of people really think about the future. \n\n2) Average man lives only 2 years after retirement. Average\nwoman lives almost 10 times more, but almost alone and with little smaller\npension. It is crucial to change the way of live as early as possible and teach\nhealthy behavior and saving patterns.\n\nIt is very useful develop a game/tool including this\ntwo issues and teaching people think in advance about their future. It possibly\ncan give some live expectancy depending on the way of live ones have and\nsavings (preferably investments) he makes in time. If you know the estimated\nmonthly allowance after retirement - It can really make you start thinking\nabout the future. Because the future is now!",

            "reflection": "The game represented a simplistic (albeit enjoyable) version of risk management. As the game progressed the player needed to balance the potential detrimental effects of the asteroid hits with the continuing development of their buildings. A player could \"research\" an asteroid which would allow the player more time after impact to minimize the damage. This is a common concept in real life, the greater you understand the risk itself and its potential impact on your endeavors the easier it is to plan for that risk. Also by understanding the risk you can take advantage of times when the risks are minimal and brace for periods when the risks increase. The game continued in this vein by allowing the player to purchase insurance to reduce the cost of repairs that the players buildings would need in the event of an impact. This again is familiar to any property owner (e.g. car, home, commercial property), the amount of insurance you need is not just the general value of the property but what will be needed to replace the property in the event of damage.Early in my first attempt at the game I concentrated only on building quickly to maximize revenue and \"guarantee\" my advancement. This strategy did not fair well, I was struck by several asteroids and was financially not in a position to cover the repairs to my buildings. After that attempt I used a more balanced approach, with every building came a purchase of insurance and an investment to \"protect\" (the little scale in the lower right) my building in case of a tragedy. I would then look for asteroids that would could do the largest amount of damage and spent the most time researching them to insure that I would have an opportunity to minimize their damage. This approach actually allowed me to progress to the 6th level (end of game). Also rather than spreading out constantly I concentrated at advancing the building I had so that I would be exposed to less financial strain in the event of an impact while still maximizing the revenue. I would have to say that the largest lesson learned form the game was to approach risk in a balanced manner, attempt to minimize the down-side while capitalizing on any opportunities.If I was tasked with developing a new version I would expand it in several ways. First I would allow the game to be networked (so that communities could work together) allowing players to join together to offset some of the risks among themselves. Secondly I would introduce other potential opportunity vehicles, such as allowing for the player to invest in some form of asteroid \"protection\" that could negate an asteroids' damage all together. Finally I would allow for the carrying-over of insurance protection from level to level, thus making the game a bit more in-line with real world events,",

            "reflection": "\nRisk Management played the key role in this game. I had to evaluate simultaneously different indicators in order to take the right decision. There is a good quote from «1984»: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. I can say that on trade-offs in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance. Everything was very important but I had to pick the most efficient Risk Management solutions. You really can't see the results immediately, but after some time you understand if it was a right solution or not.\n\nI played the game twice. The first time I lost at third level. The second time I achieved level four. Even losing the first time I gained experience. I got more Knowledge and understood how to fix my mistakes. But even playing the second time I understood the more you know the stronger player you become. I understood that you had not let the success mask your problems. Even when you win there are a lot things to be done. And evaluation of Risk Management effectiveness is the key to better results.\n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, aspects of risk management.\nIf I had a chance to add one simple thing it would be cost benefit analysis in order to see the benefits in the form of avoided impact. It would be very similar as in real life when the results of risk management are not observable in the nearest future, they are being ignored.\nWorking in the banking services industry I understand that a lot of banks here in Ukraine take excessive risks because they know they will be saved by Central Bank or Government.\nIt all drives the banking system into more complicated situation, when management is weak and incompetent, and thus banks together with clients are more vulnerable. The Central Bank has to save those banks in order to increase social support and decrease protests of clients, who saved money as deposits in such problem banks. It creates a vicious circle. And solving this problem is very tough for the Government.\nRisk Management is always more efficient and cost effective in strategic perspective but not tactically as its benefits in not observable immediately. ",

            "reflection": "Risk Management played a critical role in building the pods and the development of the community, which in turn helped me in moving to higher levels of the game until it is complete. I have performed research on the comets, which helped me in dealing with the impact; I have raised the elevation of the island based on the severity  the hit chance characteristics of the comet thereby protecting the pods; I have obtained insurance to cover any damages caused by the comets and I have connected the pods in the community in the event of the damage so that the community is more robust going forward. The sooner I carried out research on the comets, added the insurance and raised the elevation of the development, the better it became in building the community, surviving the water damage caused by the comet hits and completing the development to move on to the next level and eventually resulting in reaching level 6.I have played the game more than once. After the first time, I understood that I needed to balance the acts of adding/enhancing pods to build the community, researching comets' characteristics and accordingly increasing the elevation of the community to avoid any potential damages caused by the waves due to the comet hits, and getting the right insurance to cover the damages if any. After carrying these actions in real-time in a concerted way, I was able to build the community and meet the development goals of every level and finally reached level 6. The key to success being adding more pods and or enhancing the pods there by reaching the community development goals of a given level and also getting the right protection by raising the elevation of the development and purchasing insurance such that any damages caused by the comets are repaired/replaced by the insurance policy.Some of the things I would add/change to the game in order to enhance the risk management are - ability to raise the elevation of the island at a faster rate so that the waves causing water damage due to comet hits cannot reach the community and also add a new insurance option that covers 100% repair and or replacement costs. A novel option that could be added to the game is the ability to create mobile pods such that these pods can be moved far away from the comet impact points thereby protecting from the water damages and moving them back when there are no comet threats.  ",

            "reflection": " Overview of the Game:\n\nThe game captured succinctly the relationships between Risks\nand Reward. While development enhances values of lives in the Community, there is\ninherent Risk that goes along with Community Development.\n\nThe Role of Risk Management in the Game:\n\n·        \nKnowledge of External Environment: The game\nevidently showed that development does not happen in isolation but within an environment.\nIt becomes very critical as an Agent of Change in the community to scan the\nenvironment properly for both probabilities of loss (Risk) and of gain\n(Opportunities). Preparation is key and should be carefully planned.\n\n·        \nRisk Management prevent damages: The knowledge of\ndanger through Research provided an opportunity to deal with risk. Through\nResearch, one can easily detects sources of risks in the Game- Meteor, shocks,\nand, careful planning can mitigate against them.\n\n·        \nRisk Management helps in analysis cost and\nbenefit. The identification of a Risk factor such as the Meteor and the probability\nof causing extensive damage allow Risk Manager to anticipate cost of damage and\nthe benefit of protection.\n\n·        \nRisk Management helps in Decision Making. In the\ngame, I was able to make an informed decision by choosing appropriate insurance\nbased on the perceived level of risk and the stage of development. As the\nDevelopment progresses, the value of my insurance increases to mitigate against\ndamage from Comets and to ensure enough coverage is available for repairs.\n\nChoices: \n\n·        \nI came to know through the game that Research is\nimportant to Preparation –constantly looking out for Meteors and measuring their\ndistance to Earth helped my development strategy.\n\n·        \nI made sure the ‘Development Barometer’ on the\nleft side of my Project Site stayed Green and constantly watched out for ‘Red’\nfactors.\n\n·        \nElevating the Island by holding the Slider on\nthe Right when danger of comets beckon also helped in development.\n\n·        \nI was able to buy Insurance to repair\ndevelopment damaged by floods.\n\nTrade-Offs \n\nSometimes, I was able to measure and tolerate some levels of\nRisk by not holding the Slider to save cost rather fill pods so very quickly,\nand making sure the Meter stays green.\n\n \n\nPreparation of Risk Affect Development:\n\ni.                    \nAt the onset of Development, it helps to identify\nand quantify risk through Research. For example, the danger of Comets falling\nand causing flood provides opportunity to mitigate against loss of development.\n\nii.                  \nAs development progresses, one is able to\nquantify the amount of Insurance Policy required to repair damages.\n\niii.                 \nAll through the development stages, keeping an\neye on the horizons ensures constant protection.\n\n2.  If I was to play the Game again, what I would\ndo differently?\n\na. I will not panic at the onset\nof Risk.\n\nb. I will be more deliberate to\ndo Cost- Benefit Analysis \n\nc. I will be more prudent in\nspending my Budget by choosing appropriate insurance for each stages of\ndevelopment.\n\nLessons from the Game:\n\n·        \nWhen there is opportunity for Development, Risk\nis Inherent.\n\n·        \nRisk is not all bad and can be quantified.\n\n·        \nRisk can be prevented and can be transferred\nthrough insurance to enhance development.\n\n \n\n3.   I live in\nOntario, Canada – Some of the Changes to the Game to adapt to my Environment\nwould be:\n\n·        \nI would replace Comets with Tornadoes\n\n·        \nI would seek to develop Parks instead of an\nIsland\n\n·        \nAlso, I might develop a system that measure Rainfall\nand calibrates amount of rainfall into severity of flooding.\n\n·        \nFinally, the game will have both English and\nFrench versions to meet up with Canadian Official Language Act – Canada is a\nBilingual       Country.\n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "The\nrole of risk management in the game is balancing between risk preparation and\nthe community’s development. Within the limited resources of time and money, the\ngoal of risk management in the game is to build a strategy that can mitigate\nthe negative outcomes of being hit by the comets while creating the\nopportunities for the community to grow. Risk preparation plan is the\ncombination of three activities: knowledge (research), protection, and\ninsurance.           Knowledge (research) is to collect\ninformation about the potential risks and using that information for preparing\nthe response. Protection is the action that helps to     prevent or reduce the losses.\nInsurance helps to recover the repairing cost and the time loss of the\ndevelopment.  \n\n         There is a trade-off among these activities. For\ninstance, if spending a lot of times on the research, the developing progress will\nbe delayed. On the other hand, if spending too much money on protection or\ninsurance, there will be not enough resource to improve the community. The key is depending on the individuals’ choices how to balance these\nactivities for a better outcome. I made my choice based on my judgment which\nrelied on the knowledge and on available resources.\n\n         At first, I tried to build the pods as\nmuch as I could with all the money I had. As the time went by, the fund was\nbuilt up, I then tried to prepare for the protection. When the comets appeared,\nI spent time for research to learn about the potential hits and the possible\noutcomes. The information obtained during the research helped me to determine\nwhether to raise the level of protection or to purchase an insurance policy. I\noften prefer to raise the protection level rather than purchasing an expensive\ninsurance plan. Risk preparation affected significantly to the development in\nsome ways: it could halt the developing process immediately due to run out of\nmoney or the community’s improvement could be delayed after some time. 2.      I\nlost level 3 in the first time. I paid too much attention on development; prepared\nless for protection; and ignored research and insurance. I got hit badly; it\ndamaged and destroyed almost 40% of my works. I had no insurance plan in place for\nrecovery and I had no time to make any connection with the community. I passed\nlevel 3 in the second time but failed at level 4. I changed strategy in the\nthird time: spending more times for research; raising the protection level; and\npurchasing insurance at the minimum amount. Finally I was able to pass level 6.The\ngame reflected a real life scenario where a community was facing with many\npotential shocks and that could hinder its development. The main things that I\nlearned from the game were the benefits of risk management; the relationship\nbetween risk management and development; and some certain ways to manage risks\neffectively. By balancing among the activities of risk preparation, the\ncommunity was able to meet its goal with limited resources of time and money.3.    As\nwe have learned, risk management is a powerful instrument which can save lives,\nprevent crisis, and unleash opportunities for the development.Human lives are the most\nimportant element in crisis management. Natural disaster is the highest risk for\nhuman being which can occur at anytime, anywhere in the world .If I was tasked\nwith developing a new version of the game, I would suggest adding human element\nto the game. This element, in my opinion, represents the best interest of risk\nmanagement choices. Human capital plays an important role in development.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "                                                 Reflection- Risk horizon\ngame\n\nRisk management involves manipulating resources to achieve\ngrowth and development within the community. It requires awareness of potential\nthreats and risk and putting in place protective mechanism to off-set loss and\nto cope when losses do occur. \n\n                                                 Preparation\n\nKnowledge and Protection\n\nThe process of researching the looming threat was valuable, but\nI also observed that the longer I spent on research, the more resources that became\navailable. This indicated that knowledge can allow for exploration of solutions\nand the ability to choose the most efficient method relative to cost that can\nprovide protection. This also allows for evaluation of whether options are\nsocially or culturally acceptable. \n\n \n\nTherefore, money is saved directly as a result of avoiding\nloss and also indirectly by reducing waste from ineffective programs.\nAdditionally, I thought that in the process of gathering information, new\nlinkages can be formed between public and private sectors and also regional and\ninternational communities and this bank of resource can later be used in the\nresponse to future threats which will further save time and money.\n\n \n\nHowever, lengthy or thorough research was not always\npossible and therefore reliance on some sort of protection and insurance was\nnecessary to offset the severity of loss. This was one aspect I found I had to\ndo trade-offs, in that if a severe comet with direct threat loomed, I delayed\nresearch and instead opted to bolster the island’s protection whether through\nbuilding projects or buying insurance. \n\n \n\n                                                        Coping\n\nInsurance and Protection\n\nIt was apparent while playing, that growth needed to be paced\nand planned and also suited to the socioeconomic environment; such that despite\nthe urge to develop pods (make them bigger) and to raise the island, I also\nneeded to consider that insurance cost and repair would also be increased. Therefore,\nmy approach to how I developed the pods changed while I played, I recognized that\nprojects should evolve in such a way that maintenance of those more developed pods,\nfor example, rolling out of high speed internet didn’t unduly prevent other\nsectors of the island from being developed to meet the needs of the community,\nsuch as provision of rural roads for farming communities. Therefore, in this\nway efforts to provide insurance could be afforded both for smaller towns as\nwell as major cities and their citizens. \n\n \n\nRoad block: what\nwould I change? \n\nPreparing effectively to meet and cope with risk is largely\ndependent on what is known about the risk. Whereas some shocks give little\nwarning, such as an unexpected prolonged drought in the tropics, some shocks\ngive warnings and the impacts seen may be gradual, for example, the impact of energy\nprices on the production sector and the resultant impact on exports. During the\ngame it would be useful if one was able to forecast risk (warning prior to\ncomets coming in view) perhaps from occurrences in a neighbouring state, and\nthat during the protection and buying of insurance procedures there was the\nability to continue doing research on the comets (currently research is interrupted)\nso that early protective efforts could be put in place while continuing to\nadjust as the threat and risk changes. This would facilitate better use of\nresources, including time and indicate where to focus efforts if multiple\nhazards are faced. \n\n",

            "reflection": "My 400-word essay My reflections from the Risk Horizon game:Answers:------------1a - What was the role of risk management in the game?Mainly develop a community with the constant risk of falling meteorites. Thanks to Risk management applied, I do it win until 5th stage in the second game. I believe about this game that is a good stuff to learn about risk management.1b - What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? I developed slowly into the community, provided a security framework to enable sustainability in case of a meteorite impact . First build 3 pod-home and increment the security, after I upgrade 1 level one pot-build and build the next pod.1c - In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?I could see that the preparation had a lower cost than rebuild the pod, so I kept the preparedness in high level. 2a - If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?The first time I played I lost in the second stage and I realized that the cost of reconstruction was very high, so I defined play a second time maintaining a high security level.  2b - Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time?The second time maintained a high level of security and over to grow the community. 2c - What were the main things you learned from the game?Better grow slower, ensuring a high level of protection against the risk and uncertainty.3 - The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.\n Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which\n allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I live in Chile, we have to face earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, drought and landslides, depending the area of the country where you live. I think the only one meteorite fall explains to handling one type of risk, when in reality one faces a number of risks simultaneously. The changes I propose are a number of risks to manage different features and make the game multi language because in the world there are more people who dont speak English, if you really want to shared the game around the world is necesary do it.Thanks!!",

            "reflection": "The main role of risk management in the game is to confront\nrisks (comets), prepare for them and cope with their effects in order to invest\nin economic growth. In my opinion the game needed strategic planning to be\ncompleted. Therefore, I have pursued a specific plan. When starting the game, I\nhave noticed that protection is the most important tool to have an effective\nrisk management and that protection and insurance depends on the knowledge we\nhave.In other words, I have increased the protection level and\nbought a more expensive insurance only if I knew that the severity and the\nprobability to be hit by a comet is high. During the game I have confronted\nonly one trade-off: Balancing. To be successful in it, I have chosen to\nconstantly upgrade my pods to earn more money but at the same time I was highly\nprotecting my land, and buying moderate insurance. Because I came up with a\nconclusion that if I have a high protection level, then I will not need an\nexpensive insurance to cover my losses, since comets will not or will rarely\nhit my land. But on the contrary, if I buy the most expensive insurance and\ndon’t increase my protection, then comets will bomb the land and I will be\nloosing a lot of money by repairing my pods.As far as I am concerned, in real life, preparation for risk\ndoesn’t show its positive result until a risk emerges. And that can sometimes\ntake years. Whereas in the game the preparation of risk affected development\nimmediately maybe because of the short time we had in each level.\n\n I have played the game several times to reach the 5th\nlevel. What I have understood is  that spending more money on protection is more profitable rather than spending\nan important amount on insurance. Moreover, I have noticed that when I reach\nthe next level, I am always broke. Thus, I have decided to save some money in the previous\nlevel once the development is accomplished, so I can enter the next level with money.During the video talks I have gained a full understanding of\nrisk management but I have never implemented it in the real life. The game has\nhelped me to focus and think more about the importance of risk management in\nour lives. And I am now convinced that the delay in development in some \"countries in development\" is due to the fact that they don’t spend enough time\non the implementation of risk management or they just try\nto ignore the future. The most valuable think I have learned from this game is\nhow to choose the right balance by having the right strategic plan. At last,\nthe game has widened my knowledge about risk management and now I have an idea\nhow to implement an effective risk management in reality.\n\n If I could get the chance to adopt the Horizon game to\npeople living in my country, then I would like to add one thing: A Second Land.I am actually living in a war area where preparing and\ncoping with risk is certainly not enough for us to survive the daily shocks. At\nthis point, I would suggest adding a second land where we can build our pods\naway from the war. The second land will not be available before the 4th\nlevel; the player will immigrate when he or she cannot support the large number\nof daily comets and will have the opportunity to move to the second land after having a full knowledge about the risks that can occur there.  ",

            "reflection": "Hello Peer Reviewer,Like most of us, I too attempted many a times at the game. I could pass three levels and failed at level-4. My unique code is : BaJA5VrPlease find below Game Reflection point wise. Thank you!1.1 Role of Risk\nManagement In the game:\n\n·        \nThe comets in the game posed as risk elements.\nEach comet had a different probability of hitting the planet with a varied\namount of severity.\n\n·        \nBy understanding this, one has to implement the\nbasic principles of risk management i.e. identifying the risk, preparing to\ncope with its effects and finding avenues of development\n\n·        \nThe role of risk management was crucial as one\nhas to develop new pods, upgrade the existing pods in tandem with the comets\n(risks) hitting the planet.\n\n1.2 Choices and\ntrade-offs\n\n·        \nWhile playing the game, to cope up with the\ndamage done be the comets, I chose to take insurance after developing 1-2 pods.\nI took the insurance cover for 50% in level-1 and level-2.\n\n·        \n However,\nin level-3 and level-4, I increased the insurance cover up to 75% as 5-6 pods\nwere developed and upgraded.\n\n·        \nAs the number of upgraded pods increased, an\nincreased chance of damage was foreseen and hence I started investing cash on\nresearch and kept the protection bars (on the right) as high as four. \n\n1.3 Preparation for\nrisk affects development:\n\n·        \nWhile playing level-1, one has ample amount of cash\nand initial cost of setting up pods in low. Hence development is not affected\ndrastically in level-1\n\n·        \nHowever as levels increase, the cost of\nupgrading pods increase, the insurance costs increase and the number of comets\n(risks) increase.\n\n·        \nThere is a clear and direct correlation wherein\npreparation for risk affects development drastically in subsequent levels. \n\n2.1 Doing different\nthings after playing the game more than once:\n\n·        \nI played the game several times. When I played\nit for the first time, I was aggressively developing pods, invested low in\ninsurance as well as on researching about the risk of severity with which the\ncomets would hit the planet. \n\n·        \nAfter getting repetitive hands on the game, I\nplanned the cash flow in a balanced way. I focused on development, community\nbuilding as well as spending on research to lessen the damage from comets. I\nalso took high risk cover in higher levels to minimize the damage and get risk\ncover. \n\n2.2 Key things\nlearned from the game:\n\n·        \nAllocation of resources (cash) while planning\nrisk protection.\n\n·        \nKnowhow of upcoming risks should be practiced to\ncounter those risks in an efficient manner\n\n·        \nCommunity building is a powerful tool to counter\nrisks \n\n·        \nDiversification of resources (i.e. spending of\ncash) among risk protection tools viz insurance and researching about risks in\na balanced manner. \n\n3.1 Adding/Changing\none simple thing for newer version of game:\n\n·        \nThe research button should have numeric levels\nof protection and there should be avenues of points which boost development in\nterms of cash or shooting comets.\n\n3.2 Better represent\nthe risk management choices that matter in the place you live\n\n·        \nI live in a place where the risk of famine is\nvery high. This year the rainfall has been scanty till date and there is a\nclear risk of drought the nation is facing. \n\n•Risk - Famine•External Factors : Delayed and scanty rainfall•Environment : Affecting the vegetation as well as increasing inflation•Precautionary Measures: Creation of cold storage and efficient storage\nof surplus grains•Opporutnities : Creating employment opportunities for people by\nemploying them in the supply chain framework ",

            "reflection": "Game on Risk\nManagement reflection\n\nI do not\nusually play computer games, but I found that this game was interesting and had\nvery good learning points in regards to the subject of the course.\n\nI played\nthe game few times trying to use different strategies and f.ex. was trying to\nuse the risk preparation (increasing the level of ground at once from the first\nlevel, but it then meant the losses of time and I quickly lost, so it was a\ntrade-off), then I learnt the game better and started taking into consideration\nthe severity and likelihood of a comet hitting my pods, the amount of money on\nmy account the level of ground, the type of insurance which I have as well as\nthe amount of money which I was investing in development of my pods.\n\nAnswer on 1st question: Risk management in this game was\nplaying a very important role as the\ngame includes all main components of risk management: protection, knowledge,\ninsurance and coping. During playing I confronted the next trade-offs: \n\n·        \nif\nto use too much money on development and not to use any money on protection\n(raising the ground level), then too big damages of pods happen;\n\n·        \nIf\nto use money for insurance then less money goes on development;\n\n·        \nIf\nto use money on protection, less time is available;\n\n·        \nIf\ndamages are too big (after the comet hit), the development doesn’t happen until\nI have sufficient money to repair the damages.\n\n·        \nThe\nbigger the damages the more resources I needed to use to repair the pods\nespecially if I didn’t have any insurance.\n\nThe preparation affects the development in next ways: insurance\nimmediately takes some money, raising the ground level takes not only money but\nalso the time. some time  \n\nAnswer on 2nd  question:  As I\nplayed the game few times I tried to use different strategies, including\nchanging the number of pods to develop, changing the level of insurance, increasing\nin different degree the level of ground trying to adjust to the severity and\npossibility of comet hit. After few times I tried to start developing all the\npods and postponing the development of pods on higher levels as it costs a lot\nto develop more developed pods, as well as to repair it that developing the\ncheaper lower level pods. The research in a game doesn’t decrease the objective\ntime given for each level, however after few times of playing game I learnt not\nto spend too much time myself on research.\n\nFrom the\ngame I learnt that it is a not an easy task to manage risk and that careful\nbalance between available resources, available means of protection and\ninsurance as well as research have to be taken into consideration. I learnt\nthat the measures taken should be in proportion with the situation and risks as\nthe mistake sin evaluations, mistakes in cost benefit analysis will mean losses\nof time and finances, which otherwise could have been used for development or\nbetter preparation for more riskier situations. \n\nAnswer on 3rd   question:  If I\nwould have been a developer for this game, I would also include the costs of\nresearch depending on time spending for it as in real life researches sometimes\nare very expensive. If to take in regards to the country where I live (Denmark)\nthe cost of researches are very expensive and thus my this suggestion to add\nthe timing and money costs Is absolutely reasonable.\n\n \n\nEnd of the document",

While playing the game the choice I made was after\nlaying of few pods like three and upgrading them next provided protection to the\npods against any future strike by raising the island bar and the main thing I\ndid that kept my pods intact was doing lots of research against any possible\nstrike. Knowledge remains an important factor\nfor any community to remain safe of any impending danger, protecting the pods\nagainst any future danger pays off, if at the long run when disaster can be\nvery unpredictable. No need to spend too much on insurance if you can manage\nknowledge and protection very well. \n\nPreparing for risk will help boost development at the long\nrun because before any disaster we must have seen it coming and averted the\ndisaster this would reduce the time that should have been spent recovering from\ndisaster and increase the process of development.\n\nIf played once I would want to observe what conditions makes\nthe life bar increase faster. After playing the first time I decided to change many\nthings like spending time on research which will give me enough time in\nbuilding strong community connection when disaster happens and also raising the\nisland as high as possible to reduce any future chances of strike or effects. \n\nWhat I learned from\nthe game is there is no point pouring money into development without protecting\nthe communities in which you've invested time and resources! It is far better\nto build very high level of protection than wasting funds on disaster due to\nour ignorance. Also with lots of research we can avert major occurrence.\n\nIf am to develop the\ngame in other way I would want to provide free support in terms of funds and\nwant to know how the community is making use of the funds at some point in the\ngame and decides if to continue to help out of their good performance or to stop\nand see if things would change.",

            "reflection": "1) There are three options of risk management offered in the game: Protection, Research and Insurance. The role of risk management in the game is to find such a balance of using the options to achieve certain level of development.The immediate effect of preparation is a reduction of development growth, i.e. more we spend on preparation, lesser resources are available for revenue generation.On the other hand, if the preparation was not paid enough attention to address the high probability of meteor impact and its severity, the damage of actual meteor impact was very high and draw substantial resources out from development.If balanced properly, the investment in development in the long run results in higher returns which allows to increase investments in protection and yet support required development growth rate.2) I have played the game several times. By adjusting different tactics in the use of preparation options, I could manage to increase the revenue and successfully overcome Level 4 at the fourth attempt.Initially I chose a very cautious approach and invested too much in protection and insurance. Thus, the resources were not wisely spent to development growth.Afterwards, I started carefully balancing use of funds with a bigger emphasis on development yet investing sufficient funds to mitigate possible impact of the meteor attacks.The game is an interesting approach to learn to optimize management decisions in the environment of limited resources and risks presented.3) Indeed, the game is only a very simplified model of what real world with actual risks could be.If change to the game is possible, I would suggest to give a payer a choice of adding new risks. The user would have an ability to set the new risk's features that would, as per the user's thinking, reflect the reality of the area where the user lives. That, I believe, would allow to simulate conditions that are closer to specific region or industry, thus allowing the user to search for better management solutions in risk management.Another suggestion is to create more games for different areas / industries. For example, the type of risks could vary for a game for educational sector and for a game for roads construction or health industries, etc.Thanks!",

The additional\nprotection provided for an additional unit of height becomes less than the\nbenefit available from the other risk management tools for the same cost. \n\nThe cost to raise the settlement, buy\ninsurance, or spend time researching the comets directed resources away from the\nbuilding and upgrading of pods in the short-term. The benefits of these\npreparations were captured when the settlement was hit by a low to moderate\nseverity comet. The most severe comets were, in my experience, disastrous even\nwith a combination of insurance, protection, and the benefits of community\nnetworks gained from researching the comets. These preparations did, however,\nallow the game to progress into the 4th level even though the pace\nof development was slower than when resources were directed primarily at pod\nconstruction and upgrading.\n\nSeveral rounds of the game were played in\norder to experiment with different levels of each risk management option. The\nmost successful strategy over time was to allocate resources in relatively\nequal amounts. One lesson learned was that the highest insurance coverage wasn’t\nusually worth the extra cost, since the additional price above the lowest\ninsurance could provide greater utility when used to lift the settlement from\nthe starting position. More generally, the lesson from the game was that risk\nmanagement requires a multi-pronged approach.\n\nAn enhancement to the game\nmight involve a user controlled income adjustment. This would allow the user,\nprior to the game start, to choose what income level the settlement will have.\nThis feature would allow the user to experiment with the trade-offs of each\nrisk management tool under different resource constraint scenarios.",

On other world there are many kind of shocks:\nFloods, famine, drought, economic collapse, or even relatively  small household shocks like losing a job. \n\nWith our planet’s advance\ntechnology, we can’t  lift an entire\ncommunity up and out of flood’s path. On others worlds, they put houses on\nstills, lay down sandbags or build dams to protect their homes from flood\n\n\n\nAlorans spide themselves on\nefficiency and the beauty of design, so you should always be doing something!\nWhile your pods are developing, you could protect, or research incoming comets.\n\nThe first illuminator\nfamously  spent her days  staring into the night sky. It’s beautiful ,\nbut full of dangers. If it wasn’t  for\nher curiosity, Alora would never have reached this level of development.\n\n\n\n\n\nDid you know that even a little bit\nof protection goes a long way? Even if your pods are damaged, they’ll be\ndamaged less if you’re protected. This makes them easier to repair.\n\nProtecting the community is\nuseful, but can get expensive. The higher the community rises, the more\nexpensive it becomes to raise it further. Diminishing returns are a fact of\nlife here. \n\nI was thing: community\nconnections are a type of insurance. When disaster strikes we help each other\nsurvive by sharing resources. Forming and sustaining connection is so valuable.\n\n\n\nWhen a shock is imminent, it\nmight be too late to protect or buy insurance, but you can still make community\nconnection. By researching incomings comets, you will have more than time to\nconnect your pods, raising your protection level.\n\nCommunity connections can\nhelp  your long term protection  and insurance. Connected neighbors and\ncommunity organizationshelp one another when a shock comes. That’s why we\nconnect our pods when a flood is incoming.\n\nDid you know that you are the 151st\nilluminator? There’s  a long line of\ngreat community builders behind you, and you stand on all of their shoulders!\nSo make sure you  meet those development\ngoals. Your legacy  is at stake!\n\nDid you know that our planet orbits\nthrough an enormous stellar nursery, brimming with comets? When comets collide\nwith Alora, they rain down and cause devastating floods. The hard duty of the\nilluminator is to usher harmony into this dangerous but beautiful world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

This taught me that the infrastructure needed to mitigate the\nrisk is not sufficient and need to be improved in the areas of Research as well\nas resources for building more number of pods as well as for repairing them\nafter damage caused during devastation. \nSimilarly, Insurance cover also, need to be enhanced to 90% from current\nmaximum cover of 75%.  In this way, we\ncan gain knowledge through better research and transfer the risk to some extent\nthrough insurance.   In emergencies, the\nprotection tool may be mitigated with the help of state.\n\nBut, I found it difficult in researching more than one comet\nat one time, when two or more comets are sequentially targeting the Island. It\nis systemic and sequential risks. I was allowed to monitor and research only\none Comet at a time, hence the time to research multiple Comets at one time is\nnot possible.  Hence, it was difficult to\nresearch and gain knowledge to cope with and come out of devastation and\nresilience successfully.  But, the Research\ntool is a wonderful tool for gaining knowledge, severity and probable chance of\nhitting are really wonderful and quite helpful in estimating the severance for\npreparedness.\n\nWe could easily do the development of Pods to create shelter\nand repair the damaged ones at a quicker phase with the help of resources from\nthe state as well as from the insurance claims. \nBut this has been a quite routine task for the Islanders, as the\ndevastations are quite frequent affair. \nHence, it is quite obvious to get prepared to cope with challenging\nsituations all the while without any negligence. \n\nInsurance, is a great relief and risk transfer tool for\nfaster resilience from shocks.  Here, a\ngood thing is that buying an insurance cover according to the severity is\nexperienced right instead of buying blanket cover.  Similarly, not buying an Insurance cover is\nalso not correct, as the entire cost of devastation is quite sever and to be\nborne by the state and people of the Island. \nHence, Insurance cover acts as risk absorbent tool.  Which is a must along with Research and\nProtection to minimise the risk.  \n\nProtection tool also worked well, but it is a very costly\naffair too.  I found this tool is an\nexcellent tool, but could be used only during the heavy devastation and when\nthe sea level is going up and causing submerge of the Island.  Hence, using this tool sparingly and need\nbased is a right thing to do.   \n\nIn all the game has given me an experience of real life\nsituation.  If I were in the situation,\nhow I would mitigate the risk with available tools.  What more tools are required was felt in the\ncase of feasibility of research for multi comets.\n\nAfter devastation the community coordination and helping\neach other is one of the new method which has been introduced in the game.  Which has helped them to recover fast from\nthe shocks.\n\nI would like to thank you the WB team for giving me this\nopportunity.\n\nBest Regards\n\nRamaneswara Rao Rongala",

            "reflection": "The role of Risk Management in the game was primarily to create awareness of the main conditions and tools available to be able to face the incoming risks and more specifically threats. It helped model the decisions in terms of level of protection, transfer and knowledge at any one time as well as thinking about the future. The preparation of risk needs to be looked at in a holistic manner as over investment and under investment in risk management will affect the overall development in the long run. in the mean time it was demonstrated that the preparation for risk development can be seen and measured over time as the level of preparation and future proofing could be monitored and analysed at the end of each level. I played the game a couple of times and after the first time I realised that a combination of mitigation measures needs to be taken into account (i.e. transferring by means of insurance the risk may not be always necessary if there are other means available to protect the development, assets and investment which will ensure meeting the goals and reach objectives in the long term. It is also important to take into account the fact that the more the community is developed the better and greater resources and tools are available to cope and face risks. I could be seen after playing the game that the community affected/benefited by the risk management development play an essential role in the proactive improvement of mitigation actions and risk exposure levels by contributing to the overall development level which in turn provided greater resources available to invest in risk management actionsIf I was to develop a new version of the game I would probably include other threats such as internal events (seismic/volcanic) that would in effect incorporate other types of risks that are not only external and although they do not encourage looking at the horizon it could instead symbolise internal factors that contribute to the presence of threats and opportunities. The game could also be represented in a more earth like planet with different climatic/environmental threats and not only comet like but as stated above internal or external events such ass floods, droughts, etc. I was not really clear as to the real use of the research concept given in the game and I would probably introduce a different way to utilise this concept throughout the game as I find it to be an important aspect of the risk management process.",

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in\nterms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for\nrisk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\n \n\nThe role of risk management was to engage you into having a balance as\nto what you use to build your community. For example you could not build many\npods or you ran out of money, or if you don’t have insurance, you would pay a\nlot more to rebuild your community. Also noted was, that the more knowledge you\nhad about whether or not a comet would hit, you could prepare the island to\nprevent more serious damage. At times you were warned that the comet was going\nto hit with a high rate of probability, thus letting you know that is better to\nbuild until the comet hits.\n\n \n\n2.        If you played the game only once, what would\nyou do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played\nthe game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What\nwere the main things you learned from the game?\n\n \n\nI played the game several times, each time learning something new, at\nfirst I just build and build without looking at the knowledge, protection or\ninsurance alternatives but I did not survive very long.  The second time I was aware of my options and\nI used them with some bit of luck, I still did not have enough knowledge to\nplay the game right.  The third time I\nwas using all three options and the game started to make sense and I actually\nmade it to level three. One has to think about the community as a whole and not\nas a separate entities within the community. \nWe have to be connected to each other to stand a catastrophe and be\nthere for our neighbors in the hour of need. \nAs a planner one must have a sharp eye and not to do much of one thing\nfor the community but to do several things at once to equalize the economy.\n\n \n\n3.        The game captures, in a simplified way, some\naspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new\nversion of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What\nchange would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that\nmatter in the place you live?\n\n \n\nOne thing I would add is proper approval of having something in writing\nto ensure no one has more saying power in the neighborhood. Major developers\nlike to step in into a community and rape the land and the government officials\nbend backwards to let them in. Many times the developing areas do not go as\nplanned and after the land has been stripped of much needed trees all is left\nbehind in search of a better deal, while the community left behind is now\nresponsible for the cleanup.\n\n ",

Through the process of\nconstruction and development of Alora, a bund of information involving research\nregarding the fall of meteorites at the Alora seacost, I could measure and\ndistribute the share of development, insurance and infrastructure protection in\ncase of a meteorite fall. \n\n \n\nAfter investing at the starting of the\nbuilding protection, I choose to invest in insurance protection at 50% rate\nfrom levels 1-4. This initial trade-off worked well, because the insurance\nprotection gave opportunity to invest more in the world development.\nAdditionally, through gathering information by the bund of research graphic\nabout the risks of meteorite impact, I could choose how much of the wealth\ndisposable I would invest at the world protection. After each meteorite fall, I\ncould reduce any risk of damage by the sharing of information through the\ndifferent buildings. \n\n \n\nI played the game 4 times, and each time I\nimproved the distribution of wealth more equally between development and\nprotection of the world of Alora. At each different time I played, I learned\nhow much is important to distribute more equally the wealth in order to further\ndevelop the world buildings and their security. Additionally, I learned that if\nI invest just in development, the risk of damage increased, making more\nexpensive to repair the world. Therefore, the trade-off between risk and\ninsurance was good. \n\n \n\nThe next time I played, I invested more in\ninsurance and infrastructure protection. However, I learned that the population\nwas not happy was heavy investment in protection instead of building\ndevelopment. In the fourth time I learned that that a better distribution\nbetween insurance, infrastructure protection, and building development was\ngood. Thus, a more equilibrated trade-off was the way to go. The sharing of\ninformation about the fall of meteorites further enhanced the happiness and\nwellbeing of the population of Alora.\n\n \n\nIn the end, the game was a good and\nsimplified way to illustrate how important the investment on research,\ninsurance, infrastructure protection, and mechanism of information sharing, are\nfor the wellbeing of citizen and further development of a society. I believe\nthat all mechanism of risk management protection have to be presented separated\nof financial products. It has to be shown that insurance protection primary work\nas a form of investment into the wellbeing and development of a society, not\nthe monetary enrichment for safeguard of live standards.",

So the choice was mainly about time but also\nmoney which happen to be the key resources that are in short supply and have to\nbe competed for by the development needs of the community.  \n\nPreparation\nfor risk consumed time that would otherwise have been used to develop the\ncommunity in the short run. This cost the community valuable time necessary for\ndevelopment. However overtime the preparation actually contributed towards more\ndevelopment as resources as money increased and the development from one level\nto the other was faster and hence saving valuable time for other activities. At fist preparation seemed to be just time consuming but on realising that it was leading to more development in the longrun, it became more attractive to be emphasised. \n\nI played\nthe game more than once and the subsequent times I played I emphasized that I balanced\nthe preparation with development and protection which I had not done earlier. This\nwas by researching more about the potential shocks. I learnt that in\ndevelopment, preparation for shocks as well as how you will cope is critical to\nthe community.\n\nIf I were given an\nopportunity to change anything in the game, I would add another resistance in\nthe form of community resistance to development and political interference",

            "reflection": "Reflections from Risk HorizonThis game illustrates the relationship between development and risk management, and as development increases, so does the need to protect what has been built.  At the beginning of the game, I steadily built my community and kept insurance low, yet used knowledge on comets - in terms of time, severity, and the likelihood of a hit - in order to inform decisions on when to build and when to protect.  When a hit was \"certain\", I invested more in protection and upgrades to the pods to prevent damage; and if severity was high, I bought additional insurance.  I found that more insurance helped when I needed it.  It was much faster and easier to rebuild as those costs were low and I was able to afford it.I played the game several times with the intent of striving for balance between development and risk management, and found that it was difficult to get consistent results.  I observed that it was difficult to progress beyond level three if there was little development.  Nevertheless, I found that there was a lot of uncertainty in the game and could not figure out a distinct formula to win the game.The one thing I would change about the game would be to provide a synopsis of why I didn't progress to the next level once that happened.  I did not understand the specifics of what made me \"lose\".  Therefore, I would find it valuable if I were to learn from my mistakes in a more direct manner and apply those lessons in subsequent attempts of the game.  I think a similar synopsis that outlines best practices in balancing development and risk management would provide value and matter a great deal in the place where I live, where communities often build subdivisions in flood plains that are susceptible to damage if or when something goes wrong.  ",

The choices I made and trade off that I confronted are based on the data of the meteors particularly on the chances of being hit and the severity of the impact. Using the throve of information I was able to purchase more insurance so that I would be better protected  and  raise the ground to prevent further damage.  Using these knowledge I was able to have further development of the pods and enhanced the community.  The preparation for risk affect development came in immediately after the first impact of the meteor that caused a severe damage on the pods.  I played the game multiple times and as I go along though different levels I was able to learn based on what I did wrong that created the most damage.With the additional knowledge and experience, I was able to balance and prioritize what should  I do first and to implement the proper action to manage the risk.  If I'am tasked to develop a new game  on risk management I would suggest that the game to be presented in a more realistic way instead of outer space. I would present  maybe an island  community is threatened by global warming and as a result of the drastic changes in weather, it is threatened by big waves or tsunamis for example so that the player would know what is at stake and be able to relate on problem that would like happen in our world. ",

            "reflection": "The game presents risk management as playing a vital role in the provision of a suitable environment for community growth and development through providing avenues for disaster forecast, impact mitigation and management. It brings to the fore the high level of negative impact that that risk can have on development initiatives and the relevance of risk management initiatives in reducing the severity of the impact arising out of risk in any given situation. The combination of forecasting disasters, insurance against their effects; and protection of the island provided an ideal ground for the growth of the community which growth is eventually also vital for funding further investments aimed at protection and insurance. The game also teaches us the importance of ensuring a balanced approach when implementing risk management measures pointing out that an overreliance on one over the others may not adequately prepare you to face the potential impacts arising out of risk. During the course of gameplay, one major tradeoff was that between researching for further knowledge on the impending disaster and protecting the island from the disasters impacts and from this I learnt that while it’s important to try and understand the potential impact of an upcoming disaster, it was also vital to put in place measures to mitigate the disaster and that often we tend to prioritize one over the other to our detriment. Another important tradeoff was that between protection and wealth creation in which I learnt that measures aimed at protection will draw from the wealth of the nation while at the same time negatively impacting the process of further wealth creation. This in turn meant that the initiatives one would have taken such as insurance and research on the upcoming disaster are put on hold once the focus is turned to protection initiatives. Multiple times of play taught me the importance of balancing the different aspects of the game as well as the power that social connections have in addressing the impact of disastrous events. After the first few frustrating failures, I learnt to make sure that my research on the upcoming event was better thus providing me with ample time to forge strong community connections in the event of a disaster occurring. I found that even the highest level threats could have their impacts slashed so long as the community connections were vibrant and alive.If I was to be involved in game development, I would incorporate the impact of rapid development on the environment as one of the factors to manage during the gameplay period. This is because in the real world, we have to contend with such issues and it would also force us to explore the wider issues that climate change is bringing such as rising sea levels and changing seasons. These have a wider impact on the ability of communities to recover from disasters especially since food resources which are vital in recovery process are directly impacted.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game, was to teach about how to best judge risk and prepare for threats to the development. This included having to keep an eye on risk on the horizon, to research the risk (will it hit or not, and of yes, how much damage will it likely cause).  It required the player to at times trade off the benefit of adding to the development bar, against having money ready to spend on insurance, upgrades or additional buildings.  It also meant that not only only did you have to respond quickly to any potential threats on the horizon, but when linking communities (the yellow highlights that appeared) it taught you to respond quickly to any disasters as soon as they happened, in order not to hamper development.  I tried to assess the risks, and plan my responses before disaster struck, whether this was to increase my insurance, or ensure that I had enough money ready and available to spend for repairs immediately when needed.  Were I to play again, I would seek to get more practice in juggling less insurance for me buildings, and also experiement with having less buildings, but more upgrades, and see what worked best.  The things I learnt most from the game, was the importance of assessing risks as soon as they appeared, and the importance of resource management.  If I were to redesign the game, I would redesign it based on Australia, Canberra to be exact. Canberra, the relatively 'new' (1908) purpose built capital of Australia is surrounded by shrub-land, (called the bush) which in Australia's extremely dry, and hot environment, is prone to what's known as bush fires, intense fires that quickly spread through huge areas and in 2003, almost risking the existence of the city itself. I believe this is a suitable example to be used in this sort of risk management game. I would therefore: choose Canberra as the setting of the game, change bush fires instead of meteorites, and change the wells for housing and businesses, with upgrades being used to increase their size/productivityThe lifting of the wells, I would change for people seeking shelterInsurance and everything else, I would keep as isThese keeps the ethos of the original game: Identify and assess risktake action to limit impacttake appropriate actions (repairs) to return to a normal state as soon as possible, thereby limiting impact",

            "reflection": "This game\nhas a lot of similitudes with real life. I did the game a few times, and in each\none I was realizing the importance of planning and have to have protection. My\ninitial reaction was to build refuges, but then I realized that what I needed\nfirst was insurance, because the losses could be so big without it that at\nleast a basic insurance coverage was worth it. In real life people tend to act\nfirst (build refuges) rather than think what is the best strategy and we waste\nso many resources doing the wrong things. I also realize that the game focuses\non the importance of savings. If I had savings from one level to the next, I\ncould buy a bigger insurance right away, and then I could focus on building or\nupgrading the refuges and in building knowledge. As in real life, the better prepared\nI was from the beginning the better outcome.  The other similitude is the absolute lack of\ntime to make up your mind and do something. You have to choose among your\nalternatives in a quick way and this rush sometimes led me to mistakes. With experience\nI learned which choices to pick first and how to build a better money cushion\nfor the future. In the game as in real life you have to chose quickly and your\npast actions have an important effect on your future. Other similitude with\nreal life is that once I had suffered a major impact, I was more willing to do\ncertain things first and I realized that having a larger insurance was the best\npossible strategy, given the size and frequent meteor impacts. One thing I would change in the game is the way collaboration is addressed. My understanding was that you could build/strengthen your relations just when a meteor hit and there was almost no time to do it. I think real life is different, you build relations constantly and have more time for that than just when there is a catastrophic event.",

I must calculate or guess how much I need to prepare if the fireball hit my place. And the trade-offs here is that, I wait for the fireball come near to my planet, and choose the insurance plan which is most suitable with the percentage of hitting; however sometimes I buy a high insurance plan but there is no damage or less damage, and it is somekind of wasting money.2. The first time I try, or can be said in case if I have only one chance to play, I try to save money to increase my pod level as high as possible. For example, I create 3-4 pod, then upgrade 2 to level 2, and then wait for enough money to upgrade the 3rd one and so on. However, if the fireball hits the planet, the cost is so high even I pay for the insurance (even 33% or 50%). That is why from the 3rd time, I try to cut of the waste time, at the time all of the pod upgrade, I will upgrade or create the new pod right away. It depends on how much money I have at this time. Also the insurance, at the time the fireball nearly hits my planet, I will choose the highest insurance that fits my current money. The thing I learn in this game is how to save time also money for upgrading and buying insurance.3. If I can change one simple thing, I will add the rocket to destroy the fireball. With the fixed price for the rocket, I will think about whether buy rocket or not after comparing its price with the insurance. ",

The game also\nshows how community network is central to recovery after a disaster. \n\nI did several games, and I started without a high level of protection\nand insurance. I was able to build quickly, and level after level, I have grown\nmy insurance and protection. I felt I have reached a higher level when using an\nintermediate level of insurance: it allowed me to have enough money to build.\nOn the next parties I did, I chose to have a maximal insurance and protection,\nand was not able to build as much – and eventually failed the level. I found\nthat a \n\ntoo high level of risk preparation entails that development will be\nslower (but safer). The game shows well how risk preparation is essential.\n\n2.       Now that I have done a few games (I\nhave tried 4 times), I would play again using a 50% insurance instead of 75%\nand see if you can get to a higher level. I would also more take research into\nconsideration.\n\nThe main things I have learned from the game is how development and risk\nmanagement are intertwined and need to be run in parallel. I found it interesting\nto use the community to lower the consequences to the disaster.\n\n3.       If I was to change a little thing in\nthe game, I would diversity the threats coming (maybe I haven’t gone far enough\nto see other threats than the falling stars). For instance, have earthquakes,\nfloods, building falling apart after some time (they need renovation), a\nfinancial crisis. For instance, for a financial crisis, the money given would\nbe lower during a “financial crisis” level, so the money should be use even\nmore carefully. There would be several insurances to choose from, and several\nlevel of protection, so the game would be a little more complex. \n\n",

The main objection is too develop\nthe property as fast as possible to maximize the profits and returns, however\nwithout the proper protection and adequate insurance the development of the\nipods are at risk to damage and subsequent loss. Research is important since it\nreveals statistics with the severity and probability of a strike. With this\ninformation, the developer has the knowledge to prepare for the comet; ensure\nadequate protection and insurance if severity and probability of a strike is\nhigh or else continue to build the ipods if the probabilities are low. I found\nthat it was a must to have good insurance coverage as in the event of a comet\nstrike the cost of repairs were low and much faster to execute. Medium\nprotection also kept repair cost and repair time low and in many cases escaped\ndamage altogether. The more time spent at risk preparation the more the\ndevelopment suffered, so therefore it was crucial that focus was on the\ndevelopment and to maintain the right balance of research, protection and\ninsurance to cope with the potential damage from the comets.\nDuring\nthe first few attempts at the game, I spent too much time analyzing the comets,\nkeeping too much of a cash reserve and thus ran out of time in level 3. I\nchanged my approach to get development started quickly, maintained a low cash\nreserve to maximize the development, purchased the maximum insurance and\nincreased the protection when a comet with high potential for damage was\napproaching. This approach got me into level 4 of the game.\n\nI would\nkeep the game as is but would add an automatic warning device to alert the\ndeveloper when the severity and probability of a comet strike exceeds a set\nthreshold. This way the developer could spent more time focusing on built and\nupgrading the ipods and focus on increasing protection as required.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this particular scenario was\nto develop a space nation’s pods while mitigating the risk of comets. There are\n3 ways to do so, namely was by either protecting the settlement by raising it\non a platform, purchasing insurance, or by upgrading pods in order to get a\ngreater amount of return. Knowledge on how each of these mechanisms performed\nwas crucial to certain choices. For example, in the initial stages, it was\nimperative to sink a significant portion of capital in to insurance and\nprotection in order to protect whatever little pods were present (just 2 or 3).\nHowever, care need to taken to not overdo this as low wealth can be crippling\nto development. Next, it became clear that the focus shifted to the actual\nconstruction of pods and their development. It seemed more prudent to upgrade\nall pods to certain stage before moving on in order to prevent disparity.\nAdditionally, the balance between insurance and protection played a key factor.\nAs time progressed, it was apparent that although a certain level of protection\nwas required, a medium level (about 5 to 6 bars) was sufficient to mitigate\ndamage by pairing with the highest level of insurance. This optimization allows\nfor the cheapest repairs though protection needed to maintained at 6 bars\nconsistently in the event of a meteor strike. \nAnd finally, knowing which type of comet was going to strike was very\nimportant. Comets with low damage and low probability could effectively be\nignored, while those with medium to high damage required the most attention, regardless of probability. Patterns start to arise once the game is played\nmultiple times. For example, with an impending strike of 2 or more comets\nconsecutively, it was more prudent to repair immediately after the first strike\nat earlier stages (when protection was lower) otherwise there might not have\nbeen any pods to repair at all. But once protection was sufficient, repairs\nmay be handled after the second strike in order to reduce costs. The game\nserves to teach that knowledge is most important and that a certain balance of\ninsurance and protection are extremely important (having only one or the other\nis not sufficient to mitigate all of the risk). Also having connections were\nimportant too, though having a smaller impact. I would change the connection\nmechanism within the game. Perhaps this element could be made to better reflect\nhow international organizations or NGOs provide relief. It could be done in\nsuch a way that certain agreements or tasks have to be satisfied (for overall\ncooperation or peace) for this separate entity to assist in the recovery of the settlement.",

            "reflection": "I played three times, until I got the fifth level and I understand the balance between investing in growing and protecting by investing in insurance and reaching levels. At the end, I realized that without enough protection there was no point in growing in number since I kept investing in rebuilding. So the way of having a growing and safe community was to invest in protection as it grows. Growing should be not only in quantity but in quality to get more financing resource even if better infrastructure costs more to rebuild, it is also more resistant, as we can see the not connected houses suffers even more for not having  community chain.Having better insurance for the more developed buildings also helps financing the high cost they have and those are very important since they lend the higher financing for the rest of the community. Development pull over less developed to higher income levels.I think it would be good to add a human lost factor, and more options for infrastructure such as hospitals, and industries, some with return investment. ",

            "reflection": "The role risk management was to manage the development of a community and to prepare this community to confront risks. In the game we learnt in a practical way how important is:-manage resources: mainly in terms of economic resources and time investment. Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages. -manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks. -invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis. -the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles. The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risksThe game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones.     In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, \" Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity\". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community. ",

            "reflection": "1-     \nWhat was the role of risk\nmanagement in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you\nconfront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did\npreparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\n The role of risk management in the game was\nto protect the development planet Alora.\nAt first, you don’t even have the knowledge of what you should/can do to manage\nthese risks. As you build you’re understanding of the risks you are facing and\nhow they relate to your tools to prevent/minimize damages you get better at\nevaluating risks and choosing the best response.\n\nIt is really important to choose your\nresponse according to the risk’s characteristics, not doing so can have serious\nnegative impacts on development. For example, in the game, meteors move at\ndifferent speed. Slow meteor leave you more time to prepare: Do research and\nbuild protection but with faster ones, sometime it’s impossible to be fully\nprepared in which case it’s better to buy insurance to limit the damage.\n\nThere are also important trade-offs,\nInsurance is often an easy quick solution, but as the game progresses it\nbecomes more and more expansive, but if you started building protection early,\nthis investment remains from a phase to the other and give you a long lasting\nsecurity solution. This investment is rewarded by the fact that you can\ncompletely ignore low severity risks and concentrate on development if your\nprotection is higher than the comet’s risk severity.\n\n \n\n2-     \nIf you played the game only\nonce, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?\nAlternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do\ndifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from\nthe game?\n\n The first time, I guess I was really risk\naverse, this game/course being about risks, so I almost immediately bought\ninsurance (for no good reason because there was no imminent risk). So I\nminimized the risk right at the beginning but I also slowed down development by\nusing these resources for a temporary solution to a problem I wasn’t even\nfacing yet. I died at level 3.\n\nI played a second game, maximizing\ndevelopment and building protection early and steadily. Only when I assessed\nthat protection and research wouldn’t be enough to cover the risk would I buy\ninsurance. I won the game.\n\nI learned from the game that limited resources\nmust be optimized to manage risks in a way that minimizes negative impacts on\ndevelopment.\n\n  \n\n3-     \nThe game captures, in a\nsimplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with\ndeveloping a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one\nsimple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk\nmanagement choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nThe game already features all of the risk\nmanagement activities: Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping. But the\ngame doesn’t feature any obstacles to risk management. The game could incorporate\nobstacles on certain levels or throughout the game like not being able to do research\nor build permanent protection before your HUDs reach a certain level.",

            "reflection": "The\nrole of risk management in the game was to mitigate the damage, both economic\nand structural, caused by repeating disasters. In order to reach level four, I\nhad to choose between development/financial risks and rewards (such as investing\nin building more pods to earn more income), as well as time management (whether\nto spend time researching, and thereby offsetting the impact of the meteors, or\nupgrading my pods), and insurance (such as buying the higher-priced insurance\nto offset the costs of rebuilding). Preparation for risk affected development\nin that it was impossible to focus on one aspect of the village, like\ndeveloping the pods or raising your village, as it would impede your level\nprogress and ultimately result in failing the level. Once the village had\ndeveloped somewhat, the increased income made the investment in insurance an\neasy choice to make, thereby making the \"advanced\" village much\neasier to repair after disaster. Though the simulation was a simple approach to\ndisaster risk management, there are great advantages in having income to spend\non disaster risk insurance and other preparations for recurring disasters.\n\nOn the second game, I\ntook much more risk than my first and very conservative approach. I focused on\n1) building three pods with no upgrades in order to begin making money\nimmediately, 2) buying the second insurance option, which was less expensive,\n3) raising my village only to about 30%. Not a single meteor hit during this\nlevel, allowing me to take more financial risks. In the next level, I bought\nmedium-level insurance, focused on raising my village to protect against future\nmeteorites, and began upgrading all of my pods. I did not sustain any damage\nduring this level because of my protection. But I did discover that if I\ninvested too heavily in raising my village, I would lose the level. I changed\nmy approach on the next game, and was much more moderate in balancing building,\nprotection, insurance, and research.\n\nHowever, the challenge\nwas not entirely based in finances. I also learned there was a considerable\namount of strategy and time management skill involved, particularly in\n\"researching\" dangerous meteors. I think if I were tasked with making\none change to the game to better represent risk management choices in the\nUnited States, I would make research an economic cost, and allow players to\ndevote a certain percentage of income to \"RD,\" much as the U.S.\ndoes in investing in emergency management and crisis response activities.",

I feel that I did spend enough on following comets to accumulate\nknowledge in the game but at the same time tended to loose time which could\nhave been better spend building more pods! I often tried to eliminate risks\ninstead of just alleviating them with the right balance of risk management\ncomponents. \n\nIf I could play the game only once I would build as many\npods as I could and spend more effort in protecting the pods I build. I would\nonly insure if the chance and severity of a hit by a comet would be very likely\nand high in damage.\n\nIf I could change one thing in the game it would be a change\nin scenarios (more disasters than just comets) as eventually you will see a\npattern in the game. With different scenarios (natural and humanitarian disasters,\ndisease outbreaks, etc.) you would have to keep changing strategies to solve\ndifferent forms of risks. This is more realistic because in life you also face\nmore multiple risks and you generally don’t have time to analyze just one.    ",

            "reflection": "The role and importance of risk management was very much\napplicable in the game.  There was no way\none could win the game and go to the next level, without using your resources\non research, protection and insurance while playing the game. This shows how\nrisk management is very important within countries and communities. There was\nthe need for some choices to be made in order to distribute resources\njudiciously and rationally. To make these choices, there was always the need to\ntrade up the price of some items in order to get others. I always had to make\nsure I did not put all my money-resources just on knowledge-research, or just\nfor protection, nor just for purchasing insurance. I always tried to strike a\nbalance for, just a little bit of protection can go a long way to save a lot\nwhen disaster strikes.  Even if your pods\nare damaged, the damage will be less if you are protected, as it could be\neasily repaid, especially if you had insurance.\n\nPreparation for risk can affect development\nimmediately an imminent disaster strikes, as well as after after the disaster.\nAn entire community can be lifted up and out of flood paths using the advance\ntechnology we have today. Some of these risk management could be done by\npreparing in advance through the laying down of sandbags, building of dams to\nprotect homes from flooding or by putting houses on stilts. When shocks such as\ndrought, floods, famines or loss of job by a household strike, it might be too\nlate to protect or buy insurance, but you can still make community connections.\n\nThe game was very nice and may be, because I studied the\ncourse material and went through the videos before playing, I did play the game\njust once.  If I were to play the game\none more time, I will first of all bear in mind that the resources I am working\nwith are very limited. This is because I learnt from the game that everything\nwe do has some cost whether in time or resources, and such is the way of life in\na world where nothing comes easy.  With\nthis in mind, I will make sure I put resources on research, while making sure\nthere is enough protection, as well as affording better insurance that would be\nuse to pay for any damage on my pods (communities).\n\n I learned from the\ngame that, community protection is a type of insurance. When disaster strikes, we\ncan help each other survive by sharing resources, thus, forming and sustaining\nconnections is very valuable in risk management. I also learned from the game\nthat preparing in advance can serve a lot of lives and property when an\nimminent disaster strikes. \n\nI live in a community made up of many students. In addition\nto research, protection and insurance, a rubric for financial aid could be\nadded in the game. This aid will be paid in the next level of the game after\nthe player fails to make it. Then, in the next stage/level, he/she will pay\nthis financial aid before proceeding. This idea comes from the point that some\npeople cannot effort for insurance. \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "The most important aspect was that it is better to be safe than sorry. It was impossible to win the game without risk management. At least 2 meteors impacts were in all levels. Moreover, some of them could cause serious impact on the village growth and would cost a lot of money to repair. That money would then not be available to pick up growth after the crisis. The role of risk management in the game had several trade offs. More time spent to investigate the meteors, more time one got to connect and prepare the houses in a case of a crash and flood. However, more time exploring, less time to build protection. On the other hand, protection building slowed growth, took long time and money, but was worth it when enough protection was available in a case of a crash and flood. Insurance were expensive, but efficient regarding supporting growth. Especially, when a big impact and likely to crash meteors were on their ways.The strategy that worked best for my was to build a few buildings and update them as soon as possible. Then I added new housing projects as resources allowed. In the early stages, I was active creating protection to level 60-70%, then I was active exploring meteors to see the severity/likelihood ratio. Of all the risk management tools, protection building was the most important. Then I balanced buying expensive insurance or increase protection about 20% levels above the severity of the meteor. Insurance are more important in the upper levels as one needs to be very focused on growth and cannot spend all the time on building protection. The value of the insurance depended on my cash status. When I had a lot of cash available in the bank, I usually did not purchase the most expensive insurance, especially in the early stages. However, in the case of a high impact meteor was coming, then I did buy the most expensive insurance. You needed to buy new one after each level and they got more expensive with more updated houses. Unfortunately, the price did not go down with more protection. My biggest learning from this game was to find the balance between the different risk management options with learning and exploring the meteors. Moreover, managing risk and building protections all the time you have available from supporting growth.It would improve the game to have more risk factors, like food shortage or water pollution. Moreover, it would be interesting to be able to create alliance with some neighbor to get more systematic risk into the game.",

            "reflection": "The way the game models the risk of a meteor strike resembles in some ways the most common shock people are prone to suffer: natural disasters. The key elements of risk management are present and well balanced. For instance, the building speed and development levels are related, so investing in protection decreases the development speed significantly. As in real life, focusing resources in mitigation/prevention impacts the time. Insurance is very useful, but very hard to manage since its usefulness is as uncertain as the meteor impacts. The continuous expansion of the community is a last issue to the manage because it enhance the complexity of the system.",

            "reflection": "This game is very helpful to understand the importance of\npreparing for risk and to get familiarized with the field of risk management. Furthermore, this game introduced the importance of  balance between risk preparation and healthy\ndevelopment and how this balance help us support the growing of our community and preparing for potential risks or shocks.  Proactively\ndealing with risks can open the way to sustained progress. Failure to prevent\nand prepare for risk has tragic consequences as I realized from the game. Preparation\nfor the risk as we see in teh game involves  a combination of three actions:Research/ Knowledge: gathering information and\nincreased knowledge is an essential component of risk management. During the\ngame at the beginning of the game I did not realize the importance of research,\nafter first try I have realized that the more research we do the more accurate\ninformation become and severity and chance of hit become less thus even if  the damages happen they were manageable when we had good knowledge. Protection: this lowers the probability and size of negative\noutcomes.  I used to postpone protection\ntill further phases in the game however I realized that it is more cost-effective and have better impact when we do the protection at early stages and the more we raise the protection bar the more we\nprevent pods from being damaged. Even when damage happen as we cant prevent the damage/ risk 100%,  It is much easier and faster to repair protected pods than\nunprotected ones. Insurance: no matter what protection measures we take we can't\ncompletely eliminate the risk of negative outcomes ( shocks in this case) thus insurance can help us\nrebuild and repair pods with cheaper cost.  Insurance also helped recover lost development\ntime after my pods are repaired. It is also worth mentioning that as it appeared\nin the game insurance is to be obtained at early stage and not after the shock\nhappens as it becomes so expensive and does not have same benefits as buying it\nat early stage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy using these three powers with the perfect balance; research,\nprotection and insurance and at early stage, we can create a healthy community. This games proves that with good preparation only minimal coping mechanisms might be needed to recover leaving more resources ( wealth) for reducing vulnerability to future shocks.",

            "reflection": "The risk management played a crucial role in the game by helping one \ntake adequate step towards protecting the pods from falling comets. It \nprovided information which enabled game players take adequate measures \nwhere necessary. Information such as severity, chances of impact were \nvery important in taking a decision whether to purchase insurance or \nraise the platform by clicking the button on the bottom left side of the\n game window. During the game two things played important role in my\n choice of protection and insurance, they are information gotten from \nknowledge about comets in terms severity, chances of impact and \nknowledge. Protection of my pods was of topmost priority. At every \nchance, I was always seeking to elevate my platform so that impact from \nthe comets will be minimized on the pods. As I did this, I noticed I had\n a greater chance of surviving and succeeding to the next level of the \ngame.Preparing for risk took some time to pay off. As the moment the\n game begins I started preparing against  possible risk posed by falling\n comets. This was helpful in keeping my pod alive later during the game.Ans to Question 2I\n played the game more than ones. At first, I was just interested in \nbuying new pod and getting as many as I can buy, sometimes obtaining up \nto four before loosing the game. But in subsequent plays I stopped \nbuying more pod and restricted myself to protecting the one, two or \nthree I already have. This helped me stay alive in the course of the \ngame. A take home lesson from the game is \"to be successful one most\n take risk knowledgeably and also take measures in protecting self \nagainst future risks\". Ans to Question 3 I will reduce the \nnumbers of time a pod need to be shielded from the impact of the comet \nfrom 10 to 4 or from 5 to 2. Ones I have assurance that my pod is \ncompletely shielded from impacting comet I will take more steps \ntowards buying more. I will also make it faster to lift the platform in \norder to reduce impact from comet. I notice that the existing game takes some reasonable amount of time to be able to raise the earth platform.Finally I would include a faster option for shielding pod even if it is at a higher cost. This will be of tremendous help.",

            "reflection": "According to the World Development Report 2014 \"risk management is the process that involves confronting risks, preparing for them (ex ante risk management) and coping with their effects (ex post risk management). Thus, the role of risk management in the game is to minimize loss which is derived from risks and maximize gains which are found in opportunities. The preparation for risks required the application of knowledge, protection and insurance. Depending on the situation, these three measures may be applied collectively or individually. Moreover, whilst playing the game the tendency was to negate protection and adequate insurance with a  preference to knowledge; since this measure would have allowed the player to gain pertinent information on the pending risks. The knowledge gained allowed the player to concentrate on protection by raising the community barrier and purchase appropriate insurance. It should be noted that additional information guided the player on the level of protection that was absolutely necessary;  hence, there was no need to increase your protection beyond a particular level. Emphasis therefore, was placed on adequate insurance, but more importantly, gaining knowledge on the pending risks. Generally preparation for risk positively affects development immediately or sometime after disaster struck. However the level of impact was highly correlated to the type of mitigating measure that was applied. For example, if the player had invested all of his money on his pods, bought minimum insurance and invested zero dollar in knowledge and protection he would have been negatively affected by a disaster. For positive impact to be felt there ought to be the careful application of mitigating measures. Notwithstanding the player inability to pass level two, the game was played more than once. Obviously it was necessary to make huge investment in knowledge. The information gained guided the player on the level of investment that was needed for insurance and protection. Additionally, it was not wise to buy insurance immediately after a disaster, since the emphasis should be on recovery and development. The game though realistic will be better if it replicates prevalent risks such as hurricane, flooding, drought, financial crisis among others. The frequency of the risk must be realistic also as well as the application of the mitigating measures. I proposed therefore, that amendments  should focus mainly on risks that are common in developing countries since they are more vulnerable and have a lower level of risk management. Notwithstanding the player's comment the game was informative and interested.",

            "reflection": "The game was a nice, simple, insightful game about risk\nmanagement. With the relatively few variables, it was easy to take on, but\ndrove the important risk management points home. Risk management is critical to\nthe success of the town. Without it the town would be destroyed and unable to\nbe rebuilt. \n\nI found it most valuable to maximize research, I had the\nbest outcomes recovering when I researched before a comet hit. As the game\nprogressed, the protection became too difficult to maintain since progress to\npassing the level would stop. At the same time, there was a required financial investment\nwhich was easier to make as the game progressed than the time investment. This\ndrives home an interesting point that there is an optimal balance in risk\nmanagement between physical protection and other forms of community\npreparedness. As for the insurance, I found that it made me feel better, but it\ndidn’t appear to have the same benefit as other forms of preparation.\nPreparation was critical to the success of the development (or advancing\nlevels). \n\nIf I were to play again, I would develop my settlement\nfaster and spend less money on physical protection. I just missed making it to\nthe 6th level. Also, I would continue to research heavily and buy 33%\nor 50% insurance.\n\nThe main thing I learned from the game is how choices in\nresource allocation are critical to maintain the resilience of the town. There\nis clearly a benefit/cost to each action and while the game was relatively\nsimple, it is easy to see how the complexities of the real world could make disaster\npreparation, recovery and mitigation are difficult. \n\nOne thing I would change in a new version of the game is the\nweighting and visible benefit that insurance provides. To make the game more\nrepresentative of where I live, I would make tornadoes the natural disaster. \n\n",

            "reflection": "1\n\nThe game is about real time management of several resources mainly: time\nand budget while being exposed to risk.  Risk management enabled to continue cope with\ndamages which occur randomly and cause different level of damage between 10 to\n40 percent. \n\nAfter studying the game behavior I learned the following facts; the cost\nof development required to move to the next level was 1850$. The level of average\ndamage was about 40% which is 740$. Construction of a pod was 10 seconds and\nrepair time of a pod approximately 8 seconds so, if we assume in a random game\ntwo successive hits with damage the minimum required time to complete the\nmission is 2* 10sec/pod * 5pod + 5pod* 8sec/pod = 150  seconds\n which is the duration of the game. The\ncost of protection in terms of money is relatively low 1$/sec. and 16 seconds\nto achieve 10 % of protection which means a slow response.\n\nThis knowledge has led to the following conclusions:\n\n·        \nThe insurance is essential\nand since the cost of it is acceptable it is worth to buy the best insurance possible\n(75%)  and keep a budget reserve of 175$\nand to repair damages as fast as possible in case of a meteor hit. This action\ncan be started after the first two pods are built.\n\n·        \nIn order to complete the\nconstruction of the pods as soon as possible a large initial budget is\nnecessary so it would be better to wait for some time and then start the\nbuilding task.\n\n·        \nThe preparation for risk\ninclude: research and protection as I mentioned before these are mostly time\nconsuming activities the time should be split between them. How to divide the time\nbetween these two will depend upon the severity of the specific threat. \n\nBecause the response of the protection system is relatively slow and the\ncost is acceptable it is preferable to activate the protection system while the\nbudget is accumulated and then to initiate the development process since they\ncan work in parallel.\n\n2 \n\nI have played the game several times, the first were intuitive and it\ntook me several attempts to move to the second level. After I have studied\nclosely the behavior of the game and implement the knowledge I can move to the\nsecond level after the first or second attempt.\n\nStill under some circumstances and in spite of the implementation of the\nrisk management policies the damage is unavoidable and not all risk may be\navoided.\n\nFinally in spite of all my insights I didn't succeed to move beyond the\nsecond level. I don’t know if it is was because of bad strategy, my poor playing\nability or a computer which doesn't meet the game requirements or some combination of all of them.\n\n3\n\nCurrently we are under missiles attack from Gaza strip.  Surrounded by alarms, and booms form missile\ninterception or missile hits. The original meteors can be replaced by missiles\nand instead of raising the island, the protection will be the activation of a\nmissile protection system unfortunately this is the sad situation we live in. \n\n",

            "reflection": "After playing the Risk Horizon Game, I realized that loss is inevitable. I played the several times. Each time i became more aware of how important it was not to just focus on one part of Risk Management when decision making. Initially, I thought Insurance was all I needed to secure the future of the community. However, the cost involved due to damage seemed to be poorly spent and was not the best way to mitigate risk. Later I realized that Knowledge (research, probability, impact) and preparation allowed me to make better choices with respect to damage control and repair. Which gave me a better since of the type of insurance was best to protect the community. I found that managing growth while constantly preparing for the next catastrophe was a daunting task. These were many takeoffs that had the be considered while managing risks. For instance, before a catastrophic event, preparation had to be made to make sure necessary elevation was applied, which delayed the repair of already damaged pods, This also slowed growth and development of new pods. Value of pods, cost and insurance and probability of risk, all had to be considered at the same time in order to make the most cost effective decision, while focusing on the heath and growth of the community.What I learn from the game lead me to consider my community, and the areas that are most vulnerable to risk. I live in a coastal area which is vulnerable to hurricanes. Each year we (citizens) are given a report, based on \"research\", about the probability of a direct hit from a severe storm. This notice is also reviewed by insurance companies, who will determine the rate of insurance you will pay of the upcoming your, or, if your insurance policy will be reinstated at all, For the past five years we (citizens) have been warned of a major storm and each year insurance rates have increased or policies have been cancelled all together. The reason for the increase, insurance companies estimate the repair cost from damage due to hurricane will far exceed the value of the policy. This has caused a major problem for those who have a mortgage that require homeowners insurance. As a result the government has stepped in to provide State Owned Insurance, This insurance is sometimes two or three times the cost of traditional insurance, and with no other options we (citizens) have to pay. Needless to say, there have been Zero storms to hit this region in the past ten years. This game in a way put my situation in perspective. All the wheels of Risk Management must work together in order to be most effective. I believe this process beings with Value. The value placed on belongings. The Value placed on community. The value placed on life.",

The severity\nand chance of a comet hitting lessened the more time that I spent on\nresearch.  This helped to some\ndegree but was not a certainty. \nSometimes the research took too long and I could not prevent the hit.\n\nResearch provided the information necessary to decide which\nrisks should be taken.  If the\nchance of a hit was zero to one filled in notch or the severity of a hit was zero to one filled in notch, I spent time building and updating the pods instead of continuing\nwith research.  Research aided in determining the answers to some questions:  How much damage will this comet cause?  When will the comet hit?  Do\nI have time to raise the island?  \n\nResearch, however, did not completely abate the uncertainty\nof risk.  What type of damage will\nI have – 6% or 57%?  And the size of\nthe damage directly impacted my ability to grow.                                                                        Time was also a salient factor. \nIt took time to build pods.  Building and updating pods was expensive.  So, if I bought insurance, I had less money  to build or update.  If I raised the island, it depleted funds for building or updating.  Which do I do\nfirst?  I had to make swift decisions about the use of my resources.  Research sometimes helped\nme to make those decisions.  But decisions had to be made quickly.  The situation was not static: the availability of funds, the location of the comet, or the severity was\nalways changing.\n\nBy my third game, in order to cope with damage caused by a hit, I always\npurchased insurance.  This helped\ngreatly as the cost to repair a pod was extremely high without insurance.  I also had to balance development\nwith the uncertainty of a shock because a developed pod cost more to repair -\neven with insurance. \n\nI also noted that the game had a bias towards research.  Protection was costly, raising the\ncommunity was not necessarily encouraged; it cost you to raise the island while\nyou gained income from researching.  So, I started to research comets as they appeared and focused less on raising the island.  I sacrificed protection for research.  Access to credit would've provided funds to do both.  In New Jersey, many of the people who suffered from Hurricane Sandy did not have insurance before the disaster or access to credit after the disaster, severely impacting their ability to recover.One change that I would make to the game is the ability to apply for credit.  Access to funds would've changed the outcome for me on several occasions.  Credit would've permitted me to focus more on protection.  The game penalized me for focusing on protection, costing me both money and time.\n\nThe game showed me obstacles to risk management: uncertainty and limited access to monetary resources.  It taught me the importance of balancing research with protection costs.  Research is important but funds are necessary to implement your research findings.  Funds are also necessary to respond to and prepare for catastrophic shocks that affect more than 50% of your resources.\n\n ",

At the beginning, I focused more on protecting, and did not asses the knowledge, therefore I lost.  After a few tries I realized that I should balance my resources between building and developing the already existing constructions, but also I payed more attention to the comets severity and chances of being hit. By doing enough research, and gaining more knowledge,  I was able to prevent the damage the comets  would have caused otherwise. I still purchased the insurance because, even though it doesn't seem that it makes that much of a difference, it helps you rebuild much faster.In my final attempt, I balanced the knowledge I gain from researching the comets, I tried to match the protection level with the chances of being git,  but at the same time, I continued to build and develop my city. ",

            "reflection": "\n1. The main role was to show the importance of information, protection, insurance and coping. The aspect of knowledge is captured by the research that could be improved. The main element to use as information is the severity of the comet. The chance of impact is less important. The risk changes so chances are, that you fail to anticipate all the comets. Playing the game more often however was necessary to improve the knowledge of the risks and payoffs. So experience leads to more information and better informed decisions. \n\nThere is a tradeoff between buying insurance, protection and production capacity. Only with adequate protection is it possible to maintain a certain level of productivity, meaning that opportunities can only be seized, when risk is managed.  However, as the costs are not always clear, it is difficult to see what choices are most efficient.\n\nIn this trade off, my focus was on protection. If protection was in place, there was no need for insurance, although there still would be some damage, even if protection was adequate. Insurance was useful in the beginning, when in some cases there was lack of time to build up protection. Once protection is up, the focus lies on building production capacity. Little could be done with research, or coping. \n\n2. I played the game more than once. The first thing I changed was to buy protection immediately, instead of buying productive assets. My failure to understand the risk properly led me to focus on the wrong  things: eg productivity, instead of protection. In one case I lost quite a lot. Once protection is in place, it is possible to sustain this level of protection and to start building the community. Moreover there is a higher probability to recover in case protection is bought early in the game. If  protection is bought at a later stage, it is impossible to return to the green signal. However, the reason is not always clear. Is this because of too much protection, or too little productive assets..\n\n3. Improve the community building or coping function and make the costs and benefits more explicit. If it is possible to recover better: eg, the cost of repair would be less, the trade off between coping, protection and insurance and productivity would be become more explicit. In the version that is now working it is not possible to see what pays off most. Eg: How much can I earn with productive assets and how much can I loose. What are repair costs if I cope and how much if I insure. These choices are not very explicit.  Another improvement could be related to the function of risk management. Some risks can only be solved using insurance (when there is no protection (perhaps this would be the largest comet, but I did not see one), other risks are better tackled using protection. This element is function is absent. \n",

Every pod fosters the development rate of the world of Alora.\nThis development is desired by all of the people in Alora for their happiness\nand prosperity. Similarly numerous acts in our society is meant for the growth\nand affluence in life. But these can never be fully focused as various ill\nevents may harm us if ignored which is shown as comet in the simulation game.\n\nAlora community is facing catastrophes from falling comets\nfrom space, which is a major concern in the path of development as not all the\nfunds can be allocated into development. Thus, there should be adequate savings\nto save the community from such mishaps which have potential to make huge losses.\nSafety precautions should be taken else these comets can hinder the development.\nThough this made the community grow at a slower pace but safety was ensured at\nevery comet fall. \n\n                Game\nhad different abilities provided to us for saving community Research,\nProtection, and Insurance, which were at the cost of rate of development. \n\nThe power of research is to look into space for coming comet\nwhich provides us many relevant information like the probability of hitting comet\ninto our world of Alora, severity of hit and an estimation of time by which it\nwill hit the ground. This can also be projected to various calamities happening\nin real time in our regions. Considering the example of Bangladesh how they\ninvested money on forecasting hurricane and accordingly took right actions within\nthe stipulated time to avoid any bad consequences as much as they can. \n\n The Power of Protection keeps the world of Alora safe from\nwaves which becomes dangerous whenever comet falls in the vicinity of land.\nThis protection ability will kept the land floated which kept the lives of the\nAlora community safer. Similarly how Bangladesh took various steps like\nevacuate places where hurricane was to hit can be taken as live example of this\npower of the game which saved thousands of lives.\n\nIt is certain that such disasters can never leave the\ncommunity without loss. Here, loss can only be minimizing not eliminated. Power\nof Insurance can be handy in such cases where it gives assurance of quicker and\ncheaper rebuild and thus, faster recovery. Considering real time example of\nBangladesh hurricane disaster, insurance of any type say home insurance, health\ninsurance, Life insurance etc could be beneficial to the public in great\nextend. \n\nThis simulation game was quintessential to comprehend theoretical\npart of risk and opportunity course by applying it into pragmatic arena. It\nshowcases how risk should always be taken care with the brainstorming about\npossible coming consequences and various tools and techniques to avoid any such\nhazardous consequences. It also made me understand the tradeoff between\ndifferent abilities provided to make a balance composition to strive for the\ndevelopment of the community. As my balance went awry, small problems became\ndisastrous and may end the game resulting into devastation of the community. I\nplayed this gamed for more than 3 times to comprehend how the balance maintained\nin accord to the coming difficulty could be beneficial to foster the rate of\ndevelopment of the region. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a significant role in the game. The assignment was to protect the fords from the comet rain. In order to be effective on that, we had multiple tools but they had to be used efficiently. The amount invested on research and thus the knowledge about the comet had a negative relationship with the magnitude of the damage caused. Additionally, there were 3 options about insurance for the fords. The higher the percentage the easier was to repair the fords. Finally, the more upgraded the fords were, the less damage they suffer. The lever of preparation was crucial in order to avoid a potential hit or to minimize the damages caused. In my firs attempt to the game, I failed the first level. This was mainly due to the fact that my concentration was more towards creating multiple fords rather that upgrade and protect the existing ones. Also, by the moment I realized what I have to do, there was no time left. The second time I played the game, i followed a different strategy. I decided to built the fords at the inner part of the planet as far away as possible from the comet rain. Additionally, I tried to upgrade them as soon as possible and I also increased the insurance from 50 to 75%. By doing this, the recovery amount of money was lower. Finally, i invested as much as possible on knowledge and this was effective since the more research i made the less likely was the comet to hit the planet, and also it reduced the magnitude of the impact. Overall, the more ready I was, the less damages i had to face. In real rife, there are also choices that need to be made in terms of risk management. For instance, residencies near the sea suffer from floods and damages whenever the sea level exceed the normal. This can be prevented by adding extra measures such as built-up walls or try to understand when the next incidence will be. Risk management is applied in every day life situations because from previous experience we know that the more prepared we are, the less damage we will suffer ",

            "reflection": "How much one can invest into development, protection and insurance? How to obtain sufficient cash flow to achieve the development objective and sufficient level of protection? One just trades off investments against protection and insurance. The knowledge focus is divided between most harmful events at the horizon, disregarding low impact (severity times chance to hit) ones. … then one should cope … The game made itself clear: there is no development without sufficient protection. As more developed you became, so the time and cost of recovery will also grew up. One can buy insurance reducing costs for recovery, but insurance doesn’t cover the time spent for the recovery. … so failing in achieving the development objective was imminent.For me personally the role of insurance gained new meaning in the context of the development. Considering its limitations trading off insurance against investments of protection is not always helpful and reasonable.The role of risk management in the game supposed to be support player to achieve the development objective set by the game. The development objective, which can’t be traded off, is demanding. In everyday life, we continue wherever we ended – it can’t be otherwise. Current game session is quite short and doesn’t allow adjusting the strategies on the fly. After two consequent (random) hard hits it’s over. Allowing it to play for the development score, which takes into account casualties, sum of damage, level of development achieved and time allows player to adjust its strategies – we all deserve a second chance.P.S I’m slow with mouse, so the clicking was quite painful.",

            "reflection": "Risk is defined as the possibility of risk. It is the diversion from the expected. For anyone to effectively manage it, there has to be a trade-off between protection, research and insurance. None of these methods can work in isolation. All risks have to be researched and identified and then prioritized according to the probability of occurrence and severity of impact. Preparation of risk affected development in that I could not start managing risk before starting any development as there is no risk. However, after development, I spread out my developments so that there is no systematic risk as well as put up few developments that I could sufficiently cover using the insurance. However, for the developments that were hit and damaged, it required additional resources to restore them to the position there were in before. This also affected the level of protection to the whole development. Where there was damage to the pods, the protection that I had accumulated reduced making the developments more vulnerable even after putting in resources to protect them. However, there more developments I put up, the better it was to cope with the risks as the cluster would enable collective coping mechanism to any risk encountered.\nI played the game more than once and therefore I was able to learn that there needs to be a tradeoff between knowledge, protection and insurance for effective risk management. Moreover, for each aspect of risk management, I need to have adequate resources not only for development, but also for employment of effective risk management strategies. Moreover, different risks have to be handled differently as they come with different levels of impact and severity. Prioritization has to be done so as not to concentrate resources on a risk that although had a high level of severity, the probability of occurrence was very low while putting little effort in management of a risk whose level of severity was low but the probability of occurrence was very high.\nI would change management of risk through protection. In the game, the level of protection can only be increased but not reduced by an individual. This is because, in cases here there is no need of a lot of protection, and resources can be diverted from there to insurance or knowledge. This is so that, there are no resources that are underutilized which could have been properly utilized to manage the risks.\n\n",

            "reflection": "I played the game 8 times and each time I got a little better but still could never win level 5.It seemed like each level of the game had a certain variable that was it's focus and effected your score the most if you increased your use of it. It seemed knowledge was the best way to increase your amount of monetary reserves and at the same time saving further development of the pods until there were only low risk comets in the atmosphere. Also you should not over buy insurance. At the lower levels it seemed you only needed the second level of insurance until the higher risk comets came and you developed your pods more then you needed the third level of insurance. I think that one issue that the game did not capture and an issue I have frequently confronted when I have been involved in risk management decisions in the New York City area is that certain areas and certain populations are more vulnerable to natural disasters than others and often when you only have a certain amount of money to allocate to all areas of the City you need to prioritize.Generally, the low lying areas (more prone to flooding) and also the poor, elderly or disabled are where resources are most needed. I think the game treated all the developments as though they all had the same risk even though some were closer to the water's edge than others and in that instance you might expect those properties to be more vulnerable.You also need to somehow be able to evaluate which actions will have the most impact and that may have been what was missing in the game. For instance, if had taken my pods to the next level of development as soon as I had enough money, would that have sped my rate of return on my investment and then maybe I would have been able to be better protected? Or if I had distributed flyers to all the residents of Allora about how to prepare for disasters (preparation at their own expense to some extent) and where to evacuate to in the event a disaster hits should that have raised to score as well? Communication is often an inexpensive form of risk mitigation that cities can undertake and I think it would have been helpful if the game focused on that aspect a little more. For instance, many neighborhoods and cities in the New York region have distributed flyers that describe what type of things people need to have on hand in order to be prepared for a natural disaster and also communicated the cities' central emergency centers' locations and where to register with the fire department in the event you need assistance in evacuation which the fire department has said has been an enormous help. Overall I think it was helpful in getting the general concepts of risk management across (preparation, protection and insurance) but I would have like to have seen the repercussions of my decisions in more detail and more clearly. I think the ideas relating to prioritization and communication in relation to risk management would have been helpful to see in more detail.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game was to provide a framework for decision-making in the context of insurance choices, limited funds to spend on protection options, and the ever-changing information available to base decisions on.  Balancing the options and choices based on researching the comet severity and probability of damage was the core skill to be developed by a player.  Development of the housing on the island was needed in order to accumulate funds, so spending on houses was a requirement.  But just building with no additional measures was doomed to failure.This is because comet strikes would destroy the housing and waste a high percentage of the money invested.  By holding back on the housing development and buying one of the three levels of insurance, one could recover faster from any damage to those developments and expand later.In addition, one could research comets as they entered the picture and develop a general sense of the probability of a strike and the degree of damage severity expected from that strike.  Even if the research was only approximate, it did provide some information to base decisions on, such as to raise the island temporarily or buy more insurance in the future.  All choices involved trade-offs: raising the island cost money, buying more expensive insurance cost more money, improving the housing structures with upgrades cost money, but not all comets were worth the costly preparations.  Not building or doing any protection at all were choices in themselves, but led to poor results (uncompensated disaster and loss).This led me after playing the first time to more seriously consider insurance at the highest level, even if this later seemed extreme and unnecessary for some comet strikes.  I learned very quickly that building too much at the beginning was probably not needed and that a slow development was better, because I was able to spend funds on insurance protection, upgrades to building, and raising the island.In addition, I learned that raising the island was not very effective in protecting from damage.  Further, it was unclear that the occasionally lighted-up buildings, which then could be linked in \"community\" protection,\" contributed much to protection.  These weaknesses are built-in settings to the game and must reflect the assumptions that insurance is better, researching is important (even if incomplete information), and that other forms are of lesser effectiveness.One additional feature I would add if redesigning the game would be to represent material damages versus people damages.  People are more important than buildings and development, yet they somehow do not show up in the game.  It is assumed that more development and stronger buildings are the goal, yet people are not always in buildings.  They go outside to work and play.  People build the structures and create the value, yet the game is silent on what truly underpins development.  It is the people who evaluate the risk management and are the ones whose core skills are to be developed here.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was the better control\nand secure of the development of the community. I tray, first to protect community\ninvestisment against\nthe waves by building plot on the land then get information’s about each comet and take insurance. As trade-offs in\nterms of knowledge, protection, and insurance I have the time and the money. The\nrisk manager needs time to research, to protect and to insure. This time is to\nshort. The speed and frequency of events that produced shocks on the community\nand damage development is very high. In another hand he needs money to make\nresearches on the risk, protect the community and insure de development investisment\n(infrastructures, houses, equipments, and so one). This money is not always\navailable. So the manager needs to calculate every time.\n\nPreparation for risk affects development because\nit reduces the intensity of shocks and damages, help people or the community to\nrepair damages and to recovery development after shocks. It also reduces de\ncost of the reconstruction. After some time preparation make total control of\nthe risk.\n\nI played the game more than once. It took me\nabout 12 hours to won the first level. I won level 2 and lost level three. The\nfirst line up I use was: protection (building plot), research information about\ncomet coming, buying insurance and protection. After shock, I use to repair\ndamages, get information’s about de next comet, try to invest (build development).\n\nFirst : The that risk management is a very\ncomplex task because the manager has to be intelligent, prompt to react. Every\ntime his is searching information’s about risk, securing investisment, searching\nmoney and man power. Second: there is the “incertitude” of some risk. During\nthe game although research indicates that the comet is going to cause severity\ndamages the comet missed. Before the missed, the manager has invested in the\nsecurity (protection and insurance). Third : if the risk manager failed he is\ngoing to lost all the investisment. For example I reach three time level 2.\nWhen I failed at level 3 I have to restate the game at level 1. So risk manager\nhave to take care every time to make sure that investisment are well secured. Fourth:\nthe risk manager has to be very sensible. In game there is a signal when comet\nare coming then another when is going to heat. If the risk manager does not\ndetect the signal he cannot secure the community. Five: there is a difference between\nthe theory and the practice of risk management. In practice the risk manager\nhave a short time to do a lot of work. He need collaborators. \n\nThis game is very instructive. If there is something\nto add it may be a bank. At this level, the player cannot control the financial\naspects of the game.",

            "reflection": "The role of\nrisk management in the game was nations to develop the land and protect with\navailable funds. In preparation for the game “Risk Horizon,” I first took the\ngame’s tutorial, which gave me limited understanding of the\nprocess. I just started playing. I got to Level 2—losing Level 3. Had to start\nover at Level 1  (discouraging). I had lost\nLevel 1 three times before advancing to Level 2. I continued playing with a\nstrategy more focused on more developments (Pods). \n\nI also placed\nthe developments in a place far from the water’s edge! That didn’t work. There\nwas still water around that particular development (forgot water will take over\nland no matter how far inland it goes).\n\nI purchased\ninsurance each round I played. Initially, I chose insurance in the middle and\nlater purchase the highest; I really don’t know if it made a difference; I was\ntoo focused on how much money I had for repairs. One round of play, I clicked\non 2-additional developments and lost Level 3. \n\nIn\nreflecting on the game; and as I connected it to this week’s core reading (pp.\n53-75), I found that the game was challenging – for a novice; a by chance\n(choose to pick the right Pods to protect). While in the confines of playing\nthe game, I realized that I did have enough data available and usable\ninformation to advance to Level 5. I couldn’t process the game as one unit. I kept\nmy focus on the comets that I couldn’t control and not on the parts that I\ncould.\n\nIn our core\nreading, being “Proactive risk management can help prevent or lessen damages” (p.57).\nOr, “…by moving people away from the areas likely to be more affected and\npreparing buildings and infrastructure in advance” (p.58).\n\nIf I have\nthe opportunity to change one thing in the game, I would not have the players\nstart over again if he/she lost Level 2. I would have players repeat Level 2\nuntil they win advancing to Level 3. Also, novice players have to play enough\nrounds for MASTERY. It was a fun and\nstimulating game. I’m glad I took the opportunity to play by\nchallenging myself to-do something new. \n\nFINALLY early Saturday morning (7/12/2014)\ncoffee close by, I reached Level 5 by developing all the Pods that the land\nwould take; and upgrading them 3 at-a time. I had nothing to lose at that this\npoint in time. I hit pause to re-group while balancing between all the actions.",

            "reflection": "1) I definitely made trade-off during the game. When I was faced with risks with an higher severity and chance of hitting, I was more inclined to buy an insurance with an higher coverage and the other way around. When I was faced with the possibility of a hit that would cause great damage, I was more inclined to invest more money in protection and the other way around. Research definitely turned out to be useful in many cases.2) Playing the game once, I was inclined to take more risky decisions, as I was not sure yet what the effect of these decisions would be. The first time I played the game more with an trial and error approach than with a strategic plan. Once I played the game more often, I learned that sometimes it was better to take less risky decisions in order to progress further in the game. Therefore, I invested more money in protection, research and insurance in the latter times that I played the game. The second time that I played however, I was scared and took no risk at all. Playing the game more often allowed me to find a balance between taking risks versus taking no risks at all, making something similar to a cost-benefit analysis in my head (including the evaluation of chance of a hit, the severity of a hit, the effect that a hit would have, the cost and benefit of insurance, research and protection)3) In a new version of the game I would develop a function in which you are able to invest in research that allows you to optimize your protection methods. For example, investing an certain amount of time and money in research creates the opportunity to employ a new level of protection that would protect you more from a hot, leading to lesser damage. This creates a trade-off between investing in research and investing in insurance, as at some point research can become so advance that risk of the hit becomes irrelevant and insurance becomes unnecessary.",

            "reflection": "1.      \nThe role of risk management within the game was\nto demonstrate how risks effect developing communities and how the components\nof effective risk management, preparation and coping, are used together. I\nchose to buy the mid-grade insurance and spent a lot of time on researching the\nmeteors, but this meant less time was spent on the actual development of my\ncommunity. This effected my community because there was not enough development\ndone to the community to pass to the next level, even though what was there was\nhealthy and safe. Developing is a key aspect of this game that can be missed if\nthe focus is on other things, like research or gaining protection.  \n\n2.      \nI played the game a total of 3 attempts and\nstuck with a similar strategy each time of focusing on gaining knowledge and\nslowly developing the community with moderate insurance and protection. Of\ncourse this strategy didn’t get me pass the second level and changes to this\nstrategy obviously should be made. If I were able to come up with more time to\ntry more attempts at the game I would change my strategy to a more balanced approached.\nThis would make my focus more equal on my preparation strategies and the development\nof my community. I realized, if I were to pass into more levels, more research\ncan be done with more time, and not all research needs to happen right away so\nother aspects of risk management can gain some priority. Not only do you have\nto have all the aspects of risk management, gaining knowledge, protection, and\ninsurance but you must find the right balance between all of the also so the\nrisk management actually becomes effective. \n\n3.      \nI personally valued knowledge more than gaining\nprotection and insurance but I felt, in this version of the game, more of a\nbalance was desired. My theory was in taking a less developed community and\ngiving them more preparation with more knowledge that can then be used to\ncontinue to develop a stronger community in the future. If I were to add an\naspect of the game I would have made the structures built better initially or\nwhen repaired as my knowledge increased. That way each new building or repaired\nbuilding gained a better structure as my knowledge increased regarding the\nmeteors and how they cause damage. For me, it made more sense to increase\neffective risk management strategies first before the community continued to\ndevelop so stronger development was made in the future.   \n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon aims to teach the multi-faceted and concerted actions required to mitigate risk and realize opportunities that might be available for success. I played the game twice and there were different strategies that were adopted. In my first attempt, the main aim was to build the communities as quickly as possible. I thought that having more communities would help in agility, cooperation and sharing of resources when comets struck the planet. But at the same time, I bought the insurance that offered the least protection, because the first comet that came near had a low probability of hitting. But the strategy back-fired in the second level of the game because I had spread my resources too thin by starting too many cells and had to incur high damage costs for each of the communities because of low insurance. This caused the failure to move from Level 2 to Level 3. While developmental activity was on, the damages caused the future potential of development because significant resources were spent on repairs and damages and the threat of another comet ruining the new developmental activities did not encourage any new developments. As a result the Level 2 failure could be blamed on inadequate planning, preparations for comet strikes and spreading the resources too thin. The second attempt involved ploughing back the learning from the first attempt. This time, the game was played with a phase-wise expansion of communities and taking the highest insurance available. Also, the elevation option was exercised, which had been ignored in the earlier attempt. All this helped in crossing the second level, but the third level again caused problems to the developmental activities. Also, the comets were regularly monitored to check for the probability of strike and preparations were made accordingly. \nThe main learning from the game were that insurance would help mitigate the damage that is caused because of risks that are uncertain and are beyond the control. The lower damage costs would save the resources that could be exploited for better opportunities. Apart from this, proper planning and preparedness helps build resilience, which otherwise could cause chaos. Communities that can share resources and cooperate have an edge at surviving calamities. \nIn the game, it was observed that the comets struck at the same intervals and at the same intensity when the game was played twice. If given a task to recreate the game, I would design it in a manner that would make the sequence and the intensity of the comets striking a random event, so that the uncertainty in the game can be maintained.\n",

I knew that there was a chance that I would get hit by comets but I had to weight that up with the fact that I couldn't spend all my money of defense. After some time I developed a strategy which I though incorporated the best of both worlds. After playing the game more than once, I realised that it was more effective for me to raise my buildings instead of purchasing insurance. The reason for this is because the raised building lasts for more than one round where are the insurance you have to buy every round and the raised building did not include a time delay after the comet hit. One thing that I would change would be to hae an extra option to shoot the comets out of the air before they got the opportunity to hit you. I didn't think that it was fair that even if a comet was weak that it would take down the level that your planet was raised at. ",

            "reflection": "Effective risk management played a central role to reaching\nhigher level in the game.  Balancing risk\npreparation, execution and healthy development  with less resources  amount to massive preparation, prioritization\nand trade off. To advance to the highest level, I had to trade off high\ninsurance for a less costly one then concentrate on massive development and\nupgrade the pods while raising my village up to avoid heavy wave impact  in order to reach the next level. Quite amount\nof time was invested in researching on the comets,  centering on their severity and chances of hit.\nTreats of disaster were inevitable, therefore I had to build few pods initially, then\ninvest in raising the village up with lower insurance coverage then later upgrade\nto higher coverage once I felt most of the risks have been minimized or prepared for.\n\nThe first time I played, I spend most of my resources on\ninsurance and research neglecting the necessity  to raise my village up which later brought\ndisaster beyond my coping level. comets with high severity always brought me to\nmy kneel thereby preventing me from  reaching  the next level. research taught me that 95%  of comets that come at  the early stages of level 1 either missed or\nhave low severity level, know this gave me peace of mind to concentrate on\nraising my village up. This taught me important lesson about identification of\nvarious risks that you are exposed to, research and preparation towards\nminimizing those risk. I would recommend that upgrade should include ways of generating, growing and maintaining wealth since wealth is crucial in preparing for risk and coping with a disaster as well. The level on the game should reflect the number of risk a village is exposed to with varying modes of impact. This will promote prioritization, commitment to a cause of action or inaction.\n\n",

In the beginning it was quite easy, I thought, by buying insurance, I did not need to do any research and continue on developing and upgrading as fast as possible, but I also realised that did not keep my meter reaching the target levels to continue in the game. I realised that for each level, there was a requirement to balance the resources given along with protection needed and insurance. I also realised that buying more protection or developing the pods too quickly also did not fill my meter quick enough. After I failed the first time, I started the game by buying insurance and protecting the land at least to 4 bars as minimum, I realised it is better to start with ensuring safety then continue to build and develop the pods. If I had the opportunity to change or add something to the game, I would add that as we increase our levels, to buy research bars for comets that pass quickly by. Or even be able to keep the level of protection once we manage to link the communities and reach a higher level than the required damage level.",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a pivotal role in this game in\nprioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them. Its role can be outlined as\nbelow:\n\n·        \nTo ensure long-term survival of the community of\nAlora\n\n·        \nTo provide immediate protection and relief from\nshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insurance\n\n·        \nTo ensure timely and justified protection at the\ntime of crisis\n\n \n\nImportant choices had to be made for each crisis according\nto its severity. Due to limited resources, it was\nimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimum\nutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching the\nisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basis\nof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance of\na hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I would\nimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gather\nknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal in\nsafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, being\ncomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making a\ntrade-off between risk and resources, I was\nable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.\n\nWhile making preparations for the shock, again a\ntrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due to\nlimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted so\nthat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would not\nupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buy\ninsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on development\ndue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain more\nresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resources\nwas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoided\nby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of development\nslowed down the process of growth of resources.\n\n \n\nHaving played the game more than once, I learnt certain\nvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.\nInitially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize the\nrisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized that\ndevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick pace\nto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary to\nprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, I\nbegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordingly\nspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community against\nthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive the\nbarrage of incoming comets. \n\nThis game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-world\ncrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of time\nmanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct and\njustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.\n\n \n\nHailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize that\ncorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequate\nsocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in risk\nmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a just\nand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice to\nall citizens of the community.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "Several ways to calculate a risk.- Most common is calculating the amount of events. How severe the event in damage  loss is.Which needs historical evidence called: empirical proof.- Another is based on probability  severity. Also based on empirical proof. So you can focus your efforts and means.- The Israeli/NASA method for new situations. To exclude all unwanted events  side effects. Which is more of a heuristic method.HistoricalOne of the eldest and longest registration of actual risk management  assesments has been the first world wide enterprise: The Dutch East Indian Company called VOC. Their system, development, journey, losses, everything was registered. They are a great example how this information can be turned into research and development for building better ships, less loss of live and better return on investment. Dutch ships were one of the first standardized with brass-bound kitchen against fire hazard. An outside the ship hanging build-in outhouse which made the risk of disease significantly less.In the game- Goal to create a equilibrium between income  means, threat  return on investment.-Without (empirical proof) historical evidence an approach needs a heuristic method.- Look at the cost of restore a single living-unit or after an event the cost of restoration of a complete living-unit.- The return of investment of an insurance by a third party or by savings which can be used to invest in a further extension of the village.SummarizingIn reflection to question 1: The further living-units were expanded and the quality of the units increased by upgrading, also the cost of restoring increased correspondingly progressively. The randomness of the events and the amount of damage made calculation difficult. Trade-offs between research, protection, communication and development requires routine. It is difficult to make estimations in such a short time. In reflection to question 2: After playing the game several times, I used multiple \"scenarios\". Using different settings I gained knowledge and using this I reached level two. Calculated experiments gave useful information to reach any level faster.For example: - by putting most effort in research  development. Gaining more time.- changing insurance whenever the high risk meteor comes by.- Using the button to increase protection.All these efforts gave insight. And made possible to mix  match during the development of the village.In reflection to question 3: One of the reforms would be a possibility to invest in protection measures. But it would only obscure the main goal:- Learning to cope  recover,- Calculate costs  benefits.To answer the question nevertheless:I think of half a village in a low-lying area with a high yield  high risk, and half a village in a safer higher-lying area with lower yield  lower damage.",

            "reflection": "The role of Risk Management in the game was vital. We know that risk management includes both preparing for risk as well as coping with the consequences of it. In the game we had the choice of buying insurance which was supposed to help deal with the consequences of the disaster (in this case the meteor shower), as well as the raising of the floor level, which was supposed to help with preparation for the said risk. In this sense we had been provided with tools to manage risk by preparing in advance and coping with damage after disaster struck. The last element of risk management is collaboration at the community and other levels to deal with contingency, risk mitigation and coping mechanisms. This was also provided as a tool in the form of 'making connections' in the game. These three elements/tools were packaged with 'research', which was essentially the use of experience and forecasting to predict the occurrence of the disaster to improve preparedness and maintain control of the situation. I found that knowing the level of severity in advance allowed me to decide by how much I needed to raise the floor level. This element also mimicked real life quite well because information about the meteor shower got more accurate with time, which is true of all disaster forecasting. This created a very real and immediate trade-off between the amount of time I could spend researching the meteor and the amount of time I could spend between doing other things like raising the floor level for disaster preparation, building more assets (pods) and upgrading existing pods to increase wealth. What I learned over time was how to improve the balance between the time and energy I could allot to each of these things. I also understood the importance of renewing insurance over time and making internal connections. If I was developing the game and was allowed to make a change, then I would probably introduce an 'investment tool' where I could invest in either better researching technology or better and more expensive pods. That would bring out the trade-out between wealth generation and protections more vividly.",

            "reflection": "Risk management is obviously the main point in this game,\nthe goal being to achieve balance between getting knowledge of the risks being\nhit by a meteor, preparing to reduce possible losses, getting insurance to help\nget back on our feet and coping (repairing and start back development) when\nhit, while continuing to improve development. I started by making choices that\nhindered Alora’s development by wanting to overprotect, which resulted in\nfailing to develop and being trapped at level one. Then I took more risks with\nlower-impact meteors and spent more in development, while getting basic insurance\nat the beginning of each level. I realized that while waiting for income to\nraise, it was better to at least spend some time researching the incoming\nmeteors and, when there was none, getting some protection by raising the level\nof the ground. Starting to raise little by little since the beginning helped in\nthe long run, when more severe impacts happened; having a good base, it was\npossible to increment the protection only when a severe impact was imminent. It\nwas also typically possible to cope (repair) more easily by accepting some\ndamage after having spent a little in insurance, a little in protection\nand  a good amount of time researching to\nallow good community connections; the mix of strategies was more efficient\nwhile allowing to spend more in development.\n\nThe basic lessons I learned from the game that to me apply\nto life are to adopt a mix of strategies; to start preparing early; to never\nstay idle (if nothing can be constructed, do some research!); and not to\nunderestimate the importance of social connections. \n\nThe game seems to be made to foster equity; it seemed to\nwork better when all the first-level pods were built, then all upgraded a\nlittle, then again a little. Life is unfortunately not so equitable at the\nmoment. A harder version of the game could be made where the player starts with\nsome construction already advanced, others basic, others in ruin. And not a lot\nof money. Another version could then, maybe include different development criteria (two bars\nthat measure different things, maybe green spaces and urban development?) to be\nattained since everyone in life does not have the same criteria for a living. Finally, I'm not sure I understood how the concept of seizing opportunities was included in the game. Could there be something like a falling star going through that you can catch if you're not doing anything at that same moment?\n\nWhile I only got to level 5 and do not know what happens\nnext, I also find interesting that the type of development pictured in the game\nseems basically to be the typical capital-intensive-growth-forever we have in\ndeveloped countries. Related to the last paragraph above, isn’t there a way to\nstop development at a level 1 pod and still be happy? Food for thought!  \n\n",

We had to make various decisions\nthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming comets\nwere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the comet’s\nseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as research\ntime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take action\nto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,\nit can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level of\nprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect the\nplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance and\ndevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching a\nhigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In the\nbeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and using\nthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase in\nfinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way that\nit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance and\nprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actually\nlessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances of\nhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet through\nobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according to\nthe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not cause\ntoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protect\nAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role in\nreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one has\nto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower the\ncosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on the\nphysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutive\ntime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better that\nis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I would\npropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to the\ncontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relatively\nfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given this\nsituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions with\nlimited and slower growing financial resources.\n\n",

            "reflection": "In the game, risk management was crucial in order to win, because if we did not prepare for and cope with the effects of the comets it was impossible to reach the end goal in time. We had to share our resources (time and money) between building/upgrading and three types of risk management.The first, Insurance, allows us to transfer resources over to a time of need (after the strike of a comet). In the game, it would make the costs from comet damage lower, which was good, but it meant that we still had to repair the buildings after the shock (which consumed time and money). Knowledge, on the other hand, means getting information and then using that information to reduce the uncertainty involving the event. In the game it improved the ability of the player to deal with the situation while it was happening, but for very strong comets it was hard to avoid all damage. Finally, Protection measures reduce the impact of a shock, which in the game meant reducing the damage to the buildings (sometimes to zero).The limited amount of money and time meant that we had to focus our efforts in mostly one of these options. My first strategy was to only spend money in development (no risk management), but this only worked in the short-term: as soon as comets started hitting the planet the development would go down too much and I was not able to win the level. My second strategy was to buy the most expensive insurance there was right at the beginning of the level, but this meant I had to wait a long time to start development and then was not able to reach the required level. Finally, I decided to focus on the development but as soon as I saw a comet I would research it and try to make the protection level of the planet match the damage it would do (to avoid any damage to the buildings), and so after a comet hit I was able to continue development normally (no damage was done). This was the strategy that allowed me to reach level 5.This game was an interesting way to see the impact of preparation and coping mechanisms when dealing with disasters, and it taught me to think about preparing better for the possibility of loss in my own life. I experienced that if Protection is used without first having some Knowledge, we run the risk of investing too much or too little before a given catastrophe, thereby using our resources inefficiently, and this is the case in reality as well (we should always gain knowledge before deciding which protection measures to use).  Furthermore, the game showed how risk management is cost effective, just as explained in class, but it also requires us to have a significant amount of money upfront, which is probably the main reason why poorer countries take less risk preparation measures in general. Finally, it allowed the player to face a crucial dilemma in risk management: should I invest now in preparation or save my resources to cope later with the aftermath of the disaster?To improve the game, I would propose that the costs associated with insurance, protection and research would be proportional to the number of buildings and their stage of development, because in most real life scenarios these costs rise when you have more assets to insure/protect.",

While the scope and levels of pod constructions\nhas to be maximized within limited wealth and time, I have to minimize\nthe loss brought by the comets via prediction of severity and chance\nof hit (knowledge), raising the bars to reduce damage (protection) and\npurchase of insurance, which is to reduce the repairmen cost, and replenish\nsome of any development. \n\nI\nalways purchased the level 1 and/or level 2 insurance at the very beginning of\neach level, which reduced my capital for development. Also, after every\nchecking the severity of the comet, I spent plenty of time raising the bar to\nalign with the severity level, which halted the development and reduced capital\nfor other actions. The only aspect I did not do much for preparation for risk\nis knowledge. I only clicked on every comet once or at most twice, because I\nthought the prediction (knowledge of the risk) was not quite\nimportant. Therefore, very often I spent a lot of time and\ncapital protecting the village against the comets that were missed. This\nalso reduced the allowed time for community connections after the hit. Damage\nincreased owing to this. \n\nI\nam quite satisfied with attaining level 4. However, if I had another chance, I\nwould buy a higher level of insurance, and spend more time on research, so as\nto reduce the time and wealth used to raise the bars (protection). The higher\nlevel insurance would help me to recover sooner within limited resources and\nreplenish the losses at a greater extent. With more research, I would not spend\nany time that has very little chance to hit, but more building and upgrading\nthe pods. With limited wealth and time, the crux of the matter is to balance\nthe extent of knowledge, protection, and insurance for managing and coping with\nthe risk. \n\nIf\nI could modify the game, I would add the symbol to represent the international\nfinancial aid, for players to click on after the hit. Not only the financial\naid scale adjusts with the extent of damage, it shrinks in scale across\neach level to demonstrate the realistic situation that international donation\nwill diminish with the increased frequency of natural disasters, as people\nbecome more apathetic towards frequent tragedies. Not only this modification\nhelps simulate the realistic situation more thoroughly, it also inspires users\nto re-contemplate the unsustainability brought by behavioural dependence on\ninternational aid, as found in many developing countries.

Doing so, as in the game, you´re able to play always with a\ncertain risk, and can manage much better your city, disregarding little\nthreats.

The aim was to manage city growth\nvs city protection.\n\nChoices made and trade-offs confronted:\n\nChoices had\nto be made regarding the allocation of funds and time towards constructing\nbuildings, choosing insurance, increasing city protection and increasing comet research.\n\nThe main tradeoffs\nwere as follows:\n\n·        \nIncreasing\nconstruction would decrease available funds, and it would temporarily stop development\nat the factory, however after construction the development from the factory\nwould be increased;\n\n·        \nIncreased\ninsurance would decrease the potential loss should a comet strike, while\ndecreasing available funds for other uses;\n\n·        \nIncreased\ncity protection improves the probability that the city can successfully defend\nagainst comets with a higher severity, while decreasing available funds for\nother uses and stopping the development from all factories during the time that\nprotection is being increased\n\n·        \nIncreased\nresearch assists with identifying the most threatening comets with the highest\nchance of hitting, as well as increasing the time available to the city to\ndefend against potential floods, however it is only possible to research one\ncomet at a time and the city protection cannot be increased while a comet is\nbeing researched\n\nEffect of risk management on development:\n\nIneffective\nrisk management would lead to a flood which would immediately reduce development.\n\nIncreased factory\ndevelopment would immediately halt all development at the one factory. \n\nIncreased\ncity protection would immediately halt development at all factories.\n\nIncreased research\nwould decrease the time available to increase factory development. \n\nIncreased\ninsurance would not effect development immediately, but it would decrease the\nfunds available to increase development in the future.\n\nWhat changed after playing the game the first\ntime and what were the main things learnt:\n\nThe main\nchange was that I used research to more effectively allocate the available time\nto comets that posed the greatest threat to the city, based on the severity and\nchance of hitting. This then also increased the time available to defend\nagainst the comet once it had hit. \n\nProposed game changes:\n\nThe water\nlevel could rise continuously due to the effects of global warming.

Since risk was such a constant threat, I had to make different choices and trade-offs in order to be able to reach the next level. The things that I prioritised was insurance and protection. I felt that in order for my community to be able to survive possible threats, protection (because it minimised the damage) and insurance (because it minimised the cost even more if damage would occur) was the best way to go.2. I played the game only once. If I had played it more times, I would probably focused more on research. That would have helped me to know during which periods to focus the spending on insurance and protection, and during which periods to focus the spending on improving the community through upgrading the houses. The main thing that I learned from this game, is that it is nothing that is right or wrong and that it is a constant trade-off between what should be prioritised.3. I think that an improvement of the game would be if there were more than one kind of threat and more than one kind of damage. People in poor countries of face threats such as regarding their economy, their food intake, their house, and their personal and national security. And the damages done by these different kind of threats can be vey different, ranging from starvation and poor health to political and national unrest.      ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to ensure the least damage (or ideally no damage) to the pods when the comet hit the island. \n\nThe choices I needed to make was to decide on the level of protection, insurance cover and research in order to provide an effective level of risk management and growth of the community. The trade-off I was faced with was a cost of insurance cover and protection. The protection seemed much more expensive then the insurance cover but in case of high severity impacts both forms of protection were needed to prevent damage to the pods and reduce the cost of rebuilding them. Protection efforts had a direct impact on the speed of development - more protection meant fewer pods. In case of higher insurance cover the number of pods  built or upgraded was decreased, which consequently had a knock-on effect on the speed of earning money. However, without insurance cover the costs of rebuilding the pots would’ve been much higher.\n\nIf I were to play the game again, I would pay more attention to the probability of the hit. My main attention was on the severity and preparation levels needed rather then a probability, which sometimes resulted in me being overprotective and slowing down speed of the development.\n\nThe main things I learned from this game were:\nthe need to balance out development  growth while having in place an adequate risk management program,\nthe need to be realistic about probability of risk (not to under or overestimate the risk). \n\nIf I were to introduce a change to this game I would like to add a social response to the thread of comets damaging pods. I think many of us are easily influenced by others when it comes to making decisions. It would be good to see if the person playing the game would make correct risk management decisions when faced with different levels of concern about the forthcoming threads coming from the pods. This new addition would require that the player not only estimates the possible risk and chooses the right level of protection and preparation but also listens or ignores the comments coming from the community depending on the circumstances (based on research only available to the player). This new addition would give the player a chance to develop a better sense of what risk management feels like in a more complex environment, and how community views (based on personal views, beliefs ...) are not necessarily to be trusted. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management is the key motive of the game. We had to make a choice between protection, insurance, timing of development and at the same time keeping track of the cost of implementing these measures compared to the loss. We also need to make a choice of researching on the risk and gaining knowledge. The trade-offs confronted are mainly – 1.\tInvest time on research or invest it in implementation of protection measures2.\tChoice of insurance based on the costs and the chances and magnitude of loss3.\tTiming of development – develop or save money to cover losses4.\tProtect by increasing height immediately or wait until considerable amount of research and implement the protection5.\tMost important of all, trade-off between money and protection/insurance measuresImmediate effect of preparation of risk on development would be due to the usage of money. Some amount had to be kept aside for insurance, protection and for measures in case of loss which would have been used for development. In long run, this protection and insurance would have saved us money which could be used for development.The best strategy would be to choose optimal level of insurance, optimal height level and to spend time on research. Increasing the height would have a long term implication and a height of level 5 seemed to be optimal. With the increase in probability and intensity of risk, the development would slow down as there needs to be enough buffer amount in case of loss to get back to normal life. Spending time on research should be of high priority and would really help in saving cost of protection.I would like to add the factors like the cost of natural resources being used and cost of power in case of protection. The region I live in is currently facing shortage of electricity, clean drinking water, more usage of non-renewable resources and less of renewable resources and pollution. I believe these are the major risks in the world today and especially in developing countries. These factors are to be included in the game as development these days has got a new definition in “Sustainable Development”.",

The role of Risk Management\nin this game shows that risk and opportunity go hand in hand.\n\nThe\nchoice I made in the game is to spend all my money on either building the Pods\nor preparing for the comets to hit. I tried to build and upgrade as many pods\nas I could early in the game, so that I have enough growth generated from the\nPods to proceed the next level. I invested heavily in protection. Your first\npriority should be to focus on building the pods as fast as possible.\n\nThe\nmain thing I learned from the game is that Risk Management can save lives as\ndepicted in the game, where Alora is at risk from the falling comets and\ncausing damage and shock to the community and endangering lives. The only way\nto succeed is to find the perfect balance. Consider the case of Bangladesh in\nreal life situation, where improved preparation for natural hazards had\nsignificantly reduced the loss of life and property from the Cyclones.\n\nMy\nreflection on the game is that you learn that Risk management is the process of\nconfronting risks, preparing for them, and coping with their effects. People,\nsocieties and countries gain the ability to recover from negative shocks by\nbecoming resilient and they also retain the ability to function under risky\ncircumstances.\n\n",

If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you  were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than  once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the  main things you learned from the game?\n\nI would analyse better the\nrisks in order to create a risk map which could at least provide a better forecast\nof the risk, thus allow a better effective preparedness and response to the\nrisk. As such would also provide better mitigation measures thus a better\nsustainable development.3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.  Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which  allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you  propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in  the place you live?\n\nI would propose to set-up a\nspecial account or fund to be used in the event of a loss. \n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "      \n\n The role of risk management is the game itself. It is\nnecessary to continuously evaluate where your community is standing in terms of\ndevelopment, preparedness and safety. The first choice I made was to focus on\ndeveloping and creating the community while there were periods of no meteors.\nWhen the meteors started to come more often, I decided to focus on their\nresearch, which gave my community more knowledge and tools to prepare. In the\ncases where the severity and the chance of a meteor hitting the community was\nhigh, I immediately bought insurance and raised the community to a higher\nground in order to minimize the damage. I did not fully understand the reason\nto connect the yellow glowing structures together, but I always did it and\nended up minimizing the damage. At the time when more meteors came, the\ndevelopment of the community became jeopardized and this eventually stopped me\nfrom reaching level 6, particularly because of the frequency of the meteors and\nthe time I wanted to spend on researching their potential damage. \n\n \n\nAs I mentioned, earlier, I did play the game several\ntimes and really did not understand. When I finally understood the game, I\nplayed it once and was able to reach level 5. If I were to play it again, I\nwould keep a closer look at the development bar. At times I was so worried abut\nthe damage and the frequency of the meteors, that I forgot about making a\nbetter and more developed community. I also was concerned about trying to keep\nmy amount of money at a decent level of savings so I could further develop my\ncommunity in the future, and this kept me from developing. If I were to play it\nagain, I would spend more money to continue developing.   \n\n \n\nI would add a public services variable (health and\neducation). In addition to building the pods and a community, you could also\nhave the choice to enhance the public services that are offered to the\ncommunity. ",

Because of limited resources (money), we often had to make trade offs in spending our recources between knowledge, protection and insurance. Sometimes having of right and trusty informations and knowledge can reduce our spending in protection, I made very often trade of between protection and insurance to make optimal effects. Preparation for risk affect development  immediately through spending resources and slowing down of development but in the long term we have benefits of that through decreasing of damages, savings our resources for repairing and we provide continously development. After the first time of my playing I decreased my investments in insurance and protection, trying to harmonize that with the right and trusty knowledge, also I payed attention more on development and finding better balance between development and investment in risk management. From this game I learned how much is important risk management for optimal development. I think that maybe involving some new subjects in sharing protection responsability like goverment, NGO, or private subjects will make this game more interesting. Anyway the game is excellent for learning and understanding the risk management and its most important elements.",

When reaching good development growth rate I started to improve risk protection.A way to improve the game would be to simulate the difficulty around community connections, how they can be chaotic and slowdown communication and reactions, or they can improve the flow of coping with a \"shock\".  One of the most challenging problem my community have is the creation of organizations and the way they communicate to each other, to keep a proper workflow to cope emergency and achieve excellent  execution.  ",

            "reflection": "In the game the player must manage all the resources to provide growth and development without neglecting the risk due to comets. There are several types of comets, each one offering unique levels of severity and chances of hit, and the player must chose wisely which instrument use to protect the community from the danger. Protection insurance and knowledge are the available ways of protection and each one fits better each different kind of situation.All the options offer trade-offs, the insurance is a good call when there are imminent cases of impact with high levels of damage, but it is expensive and uses resources that could be applied to development. Protection is time consuming and costly, however offers a good option when there are a lot of incoming comets with a low level of severity. Knowledge is the least expensive one, but is only recommended when there is one big threat since it consume the players time and makes it difficult for them to provide measures to generate development and safety from others comets.In the short run the preparation was harmful for the development, but in the long run it was beneficial once resources hadn't to be spent in rebuilt, and the money kept flowing without interruption. After having played for a while, it is clear how the player learn to manage the risks. At the first time one will probably try to be fully protected, however as the game goes on it is learnt that resources can be better used. Speaking for myself, after the third level I realized that high cost insurances were not always the best choices and the resources spent in those could be easily used in development. Also, after some matches it was clear how idle resources were  unproductive for protection and development.In my opinion I would include the possibility of credit in addition of money. Credit  is something very important in modern day economies and is highly correlated with managing risks and providing development. The credit  would change the necessity of reserves for difficult times and would also create opportunity to boost development in peaceful times. Some degree of interest rates (that fluctuates from high to low depending on the insurance hired and the level of damage caused by the meteor) could also be included in order to take some elasticity out of the money system and force the player to be less risky.",

This was a very captivating way of realizing how frequently we need\nto apply risk management principles, as most of the time we are playing with\nuncertain factors to make decisions on everything. \n\nAnd it was also a very interesting way of realizing\nabout the important trade-offs we need to consider for an adequate management\nof risk given the scarcity of resources we were constrained to.\n\nI started playing in a very defensive or risk-avoiding\nway (investing too much on protection and insurance, and basically nothing on\nknowledge), and for that reason I was not making a lot of progress in terms of\ndevelopment.  Then I started leaving\nprotection measures aside and concentrated mostly on insurance and development.\nThat also proved wrong (too expensive!) and again I was not able to go too\nfar.  \n\nI played the game several times until I was finally\nable to identify a strategy that allowed me to reach level 5. That happened only\nwhen I decided to maintain a solid investment in both development and\nprotection, while deciding on insurance investments based strictly on\nknowledge. In essence, I learned that it was worth investing in knowledge to\nbetter decide on the adequate mix and timing of protection and insurance.\n\nOne of the things that I would change in a new version\nof the game, to make it a bit more realistic, is that I would not allow players\nto wait until the very last second to buy insurance against an event with a very\nhigh likelihood, and mid to high impact. In real life, insurance companies\nwould be better informed and would not sell an insurance for that kind of\nthreat. So it would be good to force players to make earlier decisions, when\nthey can take advantage of early knowledge.\n\nAnother factor that I would adjust a bit is the cost\nof knowledge. In this case it was very cheap for you to find out if those\napproaching comets were worth an additional investment in protection or\ninsurance. In real life, knowledge about many threats is not so clear and also\nnot so cheap. So it would also be interesting to make it more expensive, to add\nmore value to its contribution, and also to make you think twice about how much\nmoney to invest on it.",

            "reflection": "REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME. \nThe whole essence of the game scenario is; managing risks from comets and flooding and how to manage it in a community that is susceptible to such calamities. The game calls for thinking strategically i.e balancing between preparing for these inevitable risks and investing in community development on the one hand and also thinking about the different tools one can deploy to confront these risks on the other hand. \nI often more than not started each level with Insurance, as one progressed, the insurance policies I chose depended largely on how much was available with the need to have small funds on hand for the inevitable repairs coming a distant second in my consideration. More funds tended to be made available if one leads off with purchasing an insurance policy option which I then channeled to properties. Property development was then done and continuously improved as opportunities presented themselves. Research was a sine-qua-non at every opportunity while protecting (raising the island) often came after the green meter is filled. In preparing for inevitable risks, I often slowed new developments but consolidated on existing community awareness relationships often by raising and holding the button on the lower right briefly and leaving it before the green on the upper left completely turns red. Toggling this button intermittently seemed to help occasionally.\n\nThe game could be addictive though, but one learned to thread the fine line between risk preparation and developing ones community which is quite a thrilling challenge once you get in the game. Spend too much on building and upgrading pods and you will be exposed to comets when they hit. Any damage sustained from comets hinders progress and often means rebuilding at great costs. On the other hand, spending too much on preparing for risks leaves one with not enough money to develop the community sufficiently to make it to another level. \nOne simple thing I would want added is building of flood barrier or levees, at a cost of course, as well as underground bunker housing. The former greatly reduces flood devastation while the latter reduces casualties in the case of direct comet strikes (given advance warning through research, people can be directed to such shelters in time before the comets or floods hit). This option should be made available even from the start of the game so that we can build from the ground up.",

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in\nterms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for\nrisk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\n \n\nThe role of\nthe risk manager on the game was to promote the development of the community, allocating\nscare resources not only to development but also to risk management, namely\nthrough a couple of mitigation tools.\n\nThe limited\navailable resources, resulted on a sophisticated trade-off between investing in\ndevelopment, in knowledge, in protection and in insurance.\n\nDefinitely proper\nknowledge and preparation affected significantly the risk management approach,\nconsidering (as in real world) limited resources for the task.\n\nAlso the\nmanagement options and balance between protection and insurance presented very\ninteresting results, not rarely an over allocation of resources in face of the\nreal threats.\n\nDefinitely\ndetermining the allocation of resources between Development, Research,\nProtection and Insurance, it’s not an easy exercise, even when external factors\nlike Incentives and Behaviors are excluded.\n\nBuilding a\nhealthy community and create a legacy is definitely a challenge.\n\n \n\n2.      \nIf you played the game only once,\nwhat would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if\nyou played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first\ntime? What were the main things you learned from the game?\n\nInitially I\ntook an approach of over protection for potential risks hindering the\ndevelopment of the community. On subsequent plays a better balance between the allocation\nof resources to develop and risk management, with better results. Ultimately\nintroducing information (knowledge) on the resources allocation to development\nand risk management allowed for a better and more precise risk management\nfreeing important resources for development.\n\n \n\n3.      \nThe game captures, in a simplified\nway, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a\nnew version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing.\nWhat change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices\nthat matter in the place you live?\n\nI believe\nthat an important tool for performance improvement would be the ability to save\nprevious sessions of the game allowing for a deeper analysis and comparison of\nthe results achieved through different strategies to development and risk\nmanagement. ",

I had to\njuggle around until I realised that the three components cannot be separated for\neffective and efficient risk management. I realised that protection and\ninsurance, that would be informed by research – the more I researched, the\nlesser was the chance of hit and severity, was the best way to prepare for risk\nreduction. Preparing before shocks enables coping afterward and is an essential\ntool for development which fosters opportunities. Potential risks were reduced\nbefore the shock actually occurred\n\nI played the game several times.\nI started concentrating more on growing the community, building on every vacant\nplots/land. Later, started focusing on research. Much of my resources were\nchannelled towards this activity and the more I focused on knowing about these\nthreats the more the severity and chances of hit reduced. Knowledge is crucial,\nwithout it the whole community will be destroyed. Insurance was also helping\nupon rebuilding after the shock. It is crucial since in most case the attack\noccurs when least expected. I also realised that the more I upgraded my pods,\nthe more resources I received. This enabled me to stand the severity of a\ndisaster occurrence. When structures are built up to standards, their\nresistance to risks increases. This also reduces the resources needed to rehabilitate\nafter a shock.\n\nI think I would include coping\nmechanisms for the communities during and after a shock. There is need to raise\nawareness to increase the opportunities in risk management.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to protect the resources from maximum damage in scenarios of a comet strike. Initially, I chose to build a couple of plods and insuring them for 50% coverage instantly. But with approximately $1000 in hand, and roughly around 3 minutes to save the planet and get to the next level, I had to get the severity level high to combat the comets. In doing so, I realized that to make too many things happen simultaneously, we need more man power. But here, since it was only me, the process of building, upgrading and increasing immunity towards the comets did not take place as I would have liked it too. When I failed level 1 over two three times, I changed my strategy. To keep the development going, and spreading them all over the place, I kept building around 3 plods. I chose to increase the severity from comets instantly and after having done that to a considerable level, I chose to insure my properties just before a comet strike. So by then, the comet had missed and when the next strike was due, I took a chance to upgrade the plods and spread them along. Also, I built a couple of more new plods. And instantly increased the comet combat level when the level ticker was near yellow. This helped me gain more safety and less damage during a comet attack. Through this, I managed to cross level 2 and almost cleared level 3. So what I basically learnt from this game is that to manage risk, equal proportions of development at every phase must be done. In this case, building the plods and upgrading from time to time, while building more new plods was important. Not only that, we also had to make sure we prepared for the disasters by ensuring some safety management in case of a comet strike. And having known that no strike guarantees how much severe it would be and how badly it would affect any development, we must also make sure to insure our properties in case of such natural calamities. In that way, we do not have to spend exorbitantly in case of such scenarios. I live in Chennai, India, a coastal region of the country and my city is a high earthquake prone zone. If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would add more complexities to the game. What I mean is, the game dealt only with one apocalypse; that is, the comet strike. But there can be cases where a flood and an earthquake could happen successively. My city witnessed Tsunami in 2006 which left the coastal areas flooded and the city areas destroyed due to the earthquake. Various multiple and successive disaster management is what I would add to the newer version of the game if I were given the task which had the same. ",

            "reflection": "The horizon faced numerous risk, financial, environmental natural disasters and many others with identical chances of turning into a huge crises. Comets that flew in from the sky and infrastructure development were some of the few portfolios to consider. Poor management of these risks would certainly develop inevitable crises on the horizon.\nProperly managing such risk saw the horizon escape all the possible crises, but rather turning them into opportunities. Utilizing these opportunities contributed to the development and accumulation of wealth. Properly acquiring knowledge on the comets that threatened the horizon through research provided lots of information TO ENHANCE BETTER preparation thereby increasing resilience and protection against the shocks.\nPlaying the game improved my understanding on the importance of knowledge acquisition in solving problems. Effective research on potential shocks solves about 40% of the possible cost in damage that a community could possibly suffer from any risk. In the game I realized a possibility to develop more protection against threats after researching and obtaining confirming information on the approaching risk. I could conserve lots of resources and also raise the appropriate protection in required measurement making necessary preparation ahead of the threat.\nProper and effective networking was another way of minimizing the weight of crises. It is very important to act fast and accurately in other to beat the effects of all shocks. There are some threats that appear abruptly leaving the horizon with little time to make proper preparations. The good thing about this type of development is the ability to test the strengths of whatever systems set in place to counter any shock that appears with such a pace. From playing the game and progressing through the levels, I had total control with a good insurance plan and adequate funds to raise protection against such shocks only after suffering similar threats at the previous levels. This strength was only identified when I was able to cope with the shocks received from the threats already encountered.  \nDevelopment was affected in lots of ways throughout my attempts to lessen the impacts of the incoming shocks. There was an immediate loss in resources but an increase in revenue after threats are dealt with from claims in the insurance packages purchased. There were instances where I began to construct new structures even when I knew greater shocks were advancing at faster rate. That management approach was entirely wrong since protection was not heightened due to the absence of resources. It was only appropriate for me to continue with my development goals only when I had built great resilience through proper research and heightened protective structures backed with good insurance packages. It is always better to focus on development when better protective schemes are instituted to cater for any incoming shock.\nThe game has a very good way of introducing any player into carefully managing risks whiles improving on developmental plans. But I I think the introduction of comets made it an unlikely threat to consider. Situations presented in the course of playing the game are real and they all reflect on real issues in our everyday activities. In choosing a threat for such a game, I will suggest an everyday environmental threat like storms, tsunami, hurricane and earthquakes be presented. In doing so the player gets to relate more with the possibility of facing the threat seen. One threat that will perfectly fit into that of my community is rainstorms. Rain storms are a major to my community. Many houses are destroyed when we are visited with such threats. A lot are rendered homeless and lots of households are thrown into poverty. \n",

            "reflection": "To succeed in this game it was necessary to decide what the greatest risks were to your pods and which investment represented the best chance for growth. Risks were represented by the comets, which could strike at any time (or miss) and potentially inflict damage. Risk mitigation was represented by the opportunity to purchase insurance, with varying prices available depending on general growth strategy. Growth was represented by the building and development of the pods. The main thing I learned from the game was that trusting the same method of risk management for each level does not work, as the risks one encounters are generally not the same in every situation. Hard work will get you as far as level 4, but to get further you have to think cleverly about each situation in terms of the actual risks at the time. There are certain actions that are always sensible, for example purchasing insurance, but others that are not, for example pouring money into the pods can lead to you developing your pods too quickly.I am not sure I understood in the later levels what the best method was to get further in the game, or what was wanted of me.Were I tasked with developing a new version of the game I would make it a street full of property with fluctuating prices, \"disasters\" such a infestations of mice and bedbugs, flooding and fires, development opportunities such as home improvements, extensions and gardens, and risk management options such as insurance, sandbags, and mousetraps. I might even include cups of sugary tea to add a light-hearted note which I think was missing from this production. I think this is a day-to-day scenario that is more intuitive to people and would be more easily understood. The problem I had with this game was that I didn't really know what it was that was driving the score and as a result I overdeveloped my pods but I am not quite sure how I could have known when enough was enough. I saw the metre go yellow and red but i didn't know what the correct action was, because I am not usually confronted with the need to build and protect space pods from comets and I didn't understand the difference between the various stages of development, and why one was better than another.This completes my thoughts on the matter and I feel adding a further 200 words would be wasting the reader's time and I hope I won't be penalised for keeping it simple.

            "reflection": "1. As an illuminator of Alora, I had to balance development, protection, research and insurance to achieve milestones within a stipulated time indicated by the progress bar while saving pods from falling comets. Role of risk management is to design a suitable dynamic strategy for efficient allocation of available resources to achieve milestones with time limitation. I chose to research about falling comets before their impact well in advance and chose protection over insurance early in the game. I got protection to 3 levels before substantial development. I research falling comets with more severity than the protection I had. Then I tried to build communities after impact of comets to minimize their impact of development and progress bar. Preparation for risk consumes resources which otherwise could have been used for development immediately but protects harm imposes by comets later. Therefore, a find balance is needed between protection and development.2. First time I played the game I gave too much emphasis on insurance and did not use protection. But after a few trials and learning from tutorial, I came to know the importance of protection. In first few trials, I was not aware about community development after impact of comets, which I realized later on while playing the tutorial. It has improved my chances of success in the game substantially. Due to lack of time, I could successfully complete level 2 of the game. I also noticed that time for each level was substantially less and even after building all pods, progress bar could not go to desired levels. The main thing I learned from the game was that in real life situations when external factors change dynamically, it is tougher to take decisions to achieve progress milestones with limited resources and time. I understood the dilemma our leaders may be facing while deciding economic policies in a uncertain environment. 3. I would like to change one simple thing, i.e. , allowing less time to have more protection by lifting the island easily and in less time. That will reduce the impact of most comets damaging the development on the island. This feature should be changed since before the strike of higher severity comets, there is no time available to have enough protection level to counter their impact. In my place, luckily there are no such plenty of damaging things like falling comets or restricting things or person. A person should be allowed to protect himself against the calamity he is supposed to face within a limited time.The statistics of impact of falling comets for the game I played is as under: - \n \n Comet No\n  1\n  2\n  3\n  4\n  5\n Severity\n  3\n  8\n  4\n  2\n  2\n Chance of\n  hits \n  2\n  8\n  7\n  3\n  4\n Research\n  0\n  10\n  0\n  1\n  0\n Protection \n  3\n  3\n  3\n  3\n  3\n Damage\n  0\n  35%\n  9%\n  0\n  0\n Insurance paid\n  0\n  0\n  0\n  0\n  0\n ",

This makes\nthem easier to repair.-        \nThe second choice I make is the research because the\nmore research, the more time you will have to prepare. So I spent more time on\nresearch, especially for more severe comets.-        \n The last choice I make is the insurance because community\nconnections are a type of insurance. When disaster strikes, we each other\nsurvive by sharing resources. Forming and sustaining connections is so valuableEffect of\npreparation for risk:\n\nPreparation is very important for risk management. It avoids\ndamage if time and resources permit or restrict it otherwise.\n\nWhat I did differently\nafter the first time:\n\nAfter the first time, I opted for the community\nconnection at the expense of insurance. Community connection can help for long\nterm protection and insurance. Connected neighbors and community organizations\nhelp one another when a shock comes. So I connected my pods when a flood is\nincoming. \n\nThe main things I\nlearned from the game:\n\n-        \nEverything we do has cost, whether in time or\nresources. Such it the way of the world, where nothing come easily-        \nWhen a shock is imminent, it might be too late to\nprotect or buy insurance, but you can still make community connections. By\nresearching incoming comets, you will have more time to connect your pods,\nraising your protection levelProposition to\nbetter represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live:\n\nThe proposition I\nwould make for a better representation of the choice of risk management in\nrelation to the place I live is the following. It is important to be able to\nmanage the members of the community case by case basis when danger is imminent.\nIndeed, in a community all members have not the same level of vulnerability. It\nis often useful to save first the weakest before going to the strongest that\ncan fend for in so far of their ability.\n\n",

As the result, the cost of paying for damage on the pods, exceeded\nthe benefits of paying the insurance in advance.  \n\nDue to the uncertainty of risks that the comet hitting our development community might cause, one should always  “combine the capacity to prepare and\ncaring in advance and the ability to cope afterward” as the World Development Report 2014  has well\nstated. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management in the game served as a means by which\ndevelopment was achieved. As risk management processes became more advanced in the game, it allowed for the development of more elaborate buildings and ultimately more income that could have been re-invested into the development process. It also afforded the player the ability to strengthen their city's protection levels as well as to expand on the knowledge base of its virtual charges.In my many attempts at the game, I discovered the importance of striking balance and how difficult it truly was to achieve. Early on in the game, insurance and reinforcing\nprotection levels played prominent roles in my strategy.In my early attempts, I found it difficult to be able to match the required protection to the impending comet disaster. I tried to rely too heavily on the insurance aspect which often left me with too little time to recover. Increased protection\nlevels ensured that the comets did not devastate the buildings, which often\nwould prove costly (in terms of finances and recovery time). Often, a lack of\nprotection proved disastrous for development of the buildings in the game. Insurance ensured that losses were kept to a minimum in the event that the protection level was unable to withstand the intensity of the comet. As\nthe game progressed, however, it became necessary to ensure that a delicate\nbalance of knowledge, protection and insurance since it became increasingly more difficult to ensure that there was progress. Indeed, knowledge of the intensities of the various comets and increased protection levels became increasingly more important. Additionally, insurance premiums became more expensive as the game progressed which made it increasingly more difficult to purchase early in the respective levels. Thus it became necessary to ensure that the protection was of the highest quality or make sure that you were able to purchase the needed insurance before a major disaster had occurred. The main things I learned was that risk management is a vital tool for policymakers in the development process. I also learned that disasters tended to hit at the most inopportune times in the game, which highlighted the need for a stringent risk management strategy.If tasked with improving the game, I would include an agricultural aspect. This would allow the player to simulate a wider spectrum of disasters and would actually ground the game in a more humanistic manner. In the insurance aspect, there could be insurance for flooding as well as against pestilence. If the player has to ensure that the food supply of their virtual charges are not negatively impacted, it could provide them with the opportunity to be more empathetic if ever they reach the corridors of power and they are in a situation to affect positive change within their particular sphere of influence.

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was\nprotecting the pods from comets, which reduced development. Knowledge\n(research) didn’t cost money, but it took up time. Though it increased\nprotection without a fee, it was only specific to that one comet, like research\ninto floods won’t help fight malaria. Unless it was a high-impact comet, I only\nresearched to the lower level of “chance” or “severity”. I tried to get my\nprotection into the blue because it lowered the possibility of damage from any\ncomet. Because of my lack of money, I couldn’t increase the protection to 10\nwhile reaching the development goal. Insurance was about as expensive as\ndeveloping one pod. I had to remind myself that it wasn’t cost-prohibitive\nbecause it was made up while rebuilding. \n\nAfter I failed 3 times, changing my\nstrategy got me to level 5. I decided to only buy insurance once, instead of\nwasting the 25% fees. I had to switch from 75% insurance to 50% insurance,\nsince I would get hit by comets while waiting to accumulate the fee. 50% insurance\nkept the cost of rebuilding down while letting me build after buying it. I also\ndecreased the amount of protection I was using so I could focus more on\ndevelopment, but I had insurance right from the get go. (I was showing a bit of\nmoral hazard, but my strategy worked.) I replenished my protection after every\ncompact impact. I made sure I did a little research on every comet so I would\nknow if I needed more protection.\n\nI would add a democratic aspect.\nEach pod would have a “neglect bar”, which would decrease development if it got\ntoo high. (i.e., if other pods were being developed more than that particular\npod, or if it was damaged for a long period of time.) This reflects the\ndifficulty that politicians in the United States have with the fear of being\nvoted out of office. Constituents whose protection is working properly forget\nabout disasters and start to question its value.  I often caught myself protecting too highly\nafter rebuilding from an impact.\n\nI learned that it is very difficult\nto allocate resources. If I had good ex ante management, I often wasn’t\ndeveloping quickly enough. I understand now why developing countries have\ndifficulties with risk management: their development needs demand more of their\nscant resources.(I thought this was supposed to be a 400 word essay, so I edited to get it down to 400 from 550... that's why it's not 600.)",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game was an interesting way to illustrate\nhow risk management can be done through a combination of knowledge, protection\nand insurance. What is important to note also is the objective of the game,\nwhich can be translated in real life situation in that the player/policy maker\nwould like to go for rapid development and growth whilst also mitigating for\nrisk of a negative event from occurring. The resources, in this case, the\nfinances are finite and need to be balanced between the use for development and\nrisk management. Risk management in this aspect includes three components which\nare (1) knowledge, which in this case is research to understand the possible\nimpact of a disaster; (2) ensuring protection which are actions taken to reduce\nthe level of losses from a negative shock or improve benefits from a positive shock;\nand (3) purchasing insurance which is a transfer of risk to the insurance\nprovider when negative events strike, by paying a premium at good times, prior\nto any negative event.\n\nWith increasing level of research, the knowledge of the severity\nof the disaster and its probability of hitting the area is enhanced and\ntherefore it is expected that precautions or mitigating actions are more likely\nto be in place. From this game, there are two mitigating actions, which are\nbuilding protection against a disaster and also taking out insurance to protect\nagainst the cost post-disaster. Protection takes a longer time to build and\ncosts money. Given the time to build protection that is sufficient to overcome\nthe severity of the impact, this is the best mechanism to go for to adequately\nprotect an area from disaster. However, if there isn’t time to build sufficient\nprotection, insurance could be purchased to limit the post-disaster rebuilding\ncosts. However, insurance usually does not cover 100% of the impact and the impact\npost-disaster is not often only financial but also emotional. This often times is\nnot considered in the cost-benefit analysis. Therefore, protection is better\nthan insurance, but both should be implemented in balance. Having too much\ninsurance and too much protection is ideal, but this needs to be balanced with\nthe finite finances and the need for using the finances for development.\n\nIf development is coupled with good protection and risk\nmanagement, then the rate of development may be slowed down. However, in the\nlong term, this not only is better from a financial point of view, but it\nbecomes a culture of society to appreciate good risk management. By playing\nthis game a few times and experimenting with different strategies, I realised I\nneeded to find a good balance between developing, ensuring protection for the\nseverity of the hit and getting sufficient insurance. At first, I always went\nfor the insurance option and over protected, but that affected my development\nand slower development led to lower replenishment of my finances. In the later\nrounds, I ensured a balance of these aspects, but most importantly I paid\nattention to the level of protection to match it up with the level of comet and\nthe probability of that comet hitting the area. The main lessons learned is the\nbalance that is needed to ensure healthy development, without putting too much\nat risk and this is directly translated to how risk management should be\napplied to in real life.\n\nI live in London, where a lot of the risk management are in\nplace, in regulations and in everyday lives. Although important, many people\nwho I have spoken to have always complained about the rigour of some of the\nthings being implemented and the inflexibility that these measures have caused\nthem. Hence I think the sharing of the knowledge and the reason behind why some\nof these are important should be more widely available to not only allow a\nbetter understanding by the community, but also trigger behavioural changes\nwhich will incorporate risk management.\n\n",

            "reflection": "RISK HORIZONE. I have learned\na momentous lesson in a fun way.\n\nBy Juan Antonio Andara \n\n(juanandara@gmail.com)\n\nUnder the Risk Management Course, sponsored by\nthe World Bank in Coursera network, I received a great lesson. Experience in\nrisk management game RISK HORIZONE allowed me to experience important aspects. First, it is the requirement to hold the balance between the developments of\nthe village, the level of insurance and the level of knowledge about meteorites\napproaching the planet. It included also coping with the events once they shock\nthe village to maintain the health of the system. \n\nThe game requires making trade-offs between\ninvesting in Knowledge, Protection or Insurance to manage risks. Also it had an\nimpact on the decisions: the probability of collision, the ability to damage\nthe meteorite and the vulnerability of the area.The integrated action of all these elements was\ndynamic and complex character. Especially, since it demanded levels of\nachievement in a short period of time. Second, the needs to be monitoring the\npossible impacts of meteorites at sea, affecting growth village. Not all\nmeteorites were as likely to impact the planet. For this reason, meteorites did\nnot require the same attention. Those who were more likely to impact and higher\nlevel of damage should have more attention and research.\n\nThird, once occurring impacts of meteorites in\nthe sea, the game required a significant reaction to the event. The object of\nthis action was to reduce the damage to the houses. According to the level of\ndamage inflicted to the structures, I had to come to invest in repairing\ninvesting resources that I could have been used for development of the area. \n\nThe level of insurance allowed making the\ndecision to invest according to the stage of the game and the corresponding\ndanger level. To the extent that I increased levels of the game, in that action\nwas required to invest much more in the level of insurance, diverting\ndevelopment resources to pay for the growing demand for security.\n\nIt is a virtue of the game, providing the\nexperience of variables simultaneously handle risk management in order to\nachieve further development, with the risks involved in its management. Any\nerror or imbalance in decision always hit the level of development and\nintegrity of the area. \n\nIf I had played once, I have had worse results\nthan I had. I understood that risk management requires practice to understand\nhow to balance the elements that affect their dynamics. I learned that risk\nmanagement in complex, dynamic and successive responds to changing conditions.\nAnd it should be decided properly or undesirable events happen.\n\nI find it surprising that so far has not\nintegrated risk management to the management of development, since their impact\nis direct and real. Not a game. The limited consideration of the risk levels of\ndevelopment in each action has brought very negative consequences for many\ncountries. RISK HORIZONE is a game that can experience it without risking\nresources and people, letting you learn a great lesson in a fun way.\n\nIn my country, the entire population is affecting\nby occurrence of rain or drought. Therefore, I should replace the meteoroids by\nclouds or sun, indicating drought or rainfall events in order to make decisions\nbased on them. \n\nAnother important aspect is that in my country\npublic institutions are very weak. Therefore people in very high grade,\nsurvives by his own efforts. Often, they depend on support from the community.\nI would add to the game the ability to create networks of support among the\ncommunity as a key aspect to deal with risk.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "Risk management according\nto investopedia is defined as the process of identification, analysis and\neither acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decision-making. Risk management in this game is playing the role of acquiring\nknowledge (research) and putting in protective measures while also mitigating\nthe impact of lose in form of insurance. During the game, I had to choose\nwhether to invest in more research, gain more protection, pay maximum insurance\nor develop the neighborhood. I found myself spending more on insurance and\nresearch. Reason being, when I paid the maximum on insurance, it reduced the cost\nof repairing against damage caused. And the more I spent on research, I found\nthat I understood the impact the meteors would cause which in turn helped me\ndecide which protection measure to take. In trying to prepare for risk, I found\nthat development was slow because I had to split the resources between research\nand development. Striking a balance on what to spend on was really challenging.\n\n\nThe first time I focused more on trying\nto develop the land at a go and gaining protection. However, the second time\naround I narrowed down to three projects, spent more on research and insurance all\nthe while trying to put in protective measures. I realized that the fewer\nprojects I invested in at a go, the more resources I had to spend on upgrades and\nresearch.\n\nOverall, I learnt that in as much as\nresearch, protection and insurance are all important components of risk\nmanagement, it is not always possible to invest in all of them at once. This is\nso because limitations in resources come in and there is need to decide and\nweigh the options on which one you would want to invest in first or rather how\nmuch you are willing to spend for either one of them. I found it more rewarding\nto focus on research and developing the land at a go because the research\nhelped in understanding how much protection my investment needed. I also went\nfor the full insurance premium because once my projects suffered damage or\nshock, I was able to repair them at a much lower cost than if I had spent less\non insurance i.e. putting in place coping mechanisms.I think insurance is a form of\nprotection, as such I would recommend the two are not separated but rather embedded\nin one feature.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

In what\nways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or\nafter some time)?\nThe role of risk management in the game\ncentered around building, insurance and research of the incoming\ncomets. The trade-offs centered on brisk building costs offset by\nhigh insurance costs to then study the comet approaching. Continual\nbuilding was required in order to move forward in the game while the\nsetbacks could be mitigated by research which gave you more time to\nlessen the damage. The high insurance cost could be dealt with by\nbuying early in the round when it was cheaper due to the lower value\nof the property. The more building you did drove up the cost of the\ninsurance as a whole. The rate of wealth was steady while the comets\nseverity could change radically. Several misses could create a window\nof opportunity to meet your goal. The flip side was as the comets hit\nsteadily you had no increase in wealth to catch up during the round.\nInsurance was the only way to lessen the rebuilding process and\nresearch gave you more of a chance to lessen the heavy damage.\nRaising the level of the property seemed to be counter productive\nwith the time constraints.\n2\nIf you played the game only once, what\nwould you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively,\nif you played the game more than once, what did you do differently\nafter the first time? What were the main things you learned from the\ngame?\nI played the game multiple times\nbecause I am conservative by nature while the game required an\naggressive approach. Acquiring wealth was not paced with the amount\nof devastation that could be unleashed on the properties. For\ninstance I had a 70% destruction with 75% insurance and there was no\ntime to rebuild and meet your goal. In such a scenario you would need\na faster wealth pace and a longer time horizon.  I definitely learned\nto change the rate of insurance buying to early in the round and\nresearch of the sever comets for longer periods created the best\nresults. Building aggressively also became a focus of the game as you\nsaw how important it was to going to the next round. \n\n3\nThe game captures, in a simplified way,\nsome aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with\ndeveloping a new version of the game, which allows you to change or\nadd one simple thing. What change would you propose to better\nrepresent the risk management choices that matter in the place you\nlive?\nAuburn, California would have less risk\nof catastrophic happenings in the time horizon. Auburn does not\nexperience catastrophic events generally of any kind. The game would\nneed to allow for less severe outcomes  and the insurance and\nresearch costs could come way down. Meeting and maintaining the\nbuilding requirements would be much more attainable due to the new\nrisk averse model. The big change to the game for Auburn would be\nreleasing water to So. California during a drought. Managing the\ncontracts to allow for this expected risk would be my change in the\ngame for this area. If the resevoirs were able to build up over the\nlean years, the area would have not problem meeting the demands for\nwater in the region. Due to the contracts created to keep the water\nflowing out of the reservoirs, their purpose is negated. Our game\nfocus would be on water flow management.\n",

The game was very nice to help us students to\nunderstand that everything starts with information (as when analyzing the\nmeteor impact probability and damage), followed by preventive measures (elevate\nthe ground) and/or in insurance, especially when the preventive measures were\nnot enough. Development of the silos (units) was key to keep population happy\nand producing, so the incentives also were key to progress in the game. This is\nthe same as in the live. In rural areas, government incentives will allow\npeople to take more risks and grow, while insurance and preventive measures can\nprevent damage to the plantations. In urban areas, companies need to foresee\nnot only the events that would harm business, but allow employees to take risks\nas opportunities for internal growth, and allow people to fail because without\nthat very few will want to adventure and take calculated risks.\nThe\ntraining so far is very good, and I am eager to start weeks 3 and 4!\n\n \n\n ",

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you\nconfront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did\npreparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThis game,  a real time strategy game that teaches how and\nwhy risk management is important for healthy development, show the role of risk\nmanagement as a task of  developing  ones community to the best of abilities while\nmeeting certain milestones along the way. (Balancing between growing in the community\nand preparing for potential shocks). In\nfact, in this game we have to manage with several parameters\n\nThe\nchoices I mad are to protect efficiency pods, and trade-offs assuming responsibility\nto lose some money (dollars) in order to protect pods for comets dangers (falling\ncomets shocks). Theses choices and trade-offs, Balance Risk Preparation and healthily\nDevelopment was confronted in terms of:\n\n-  The\npower to look out into space and learn the chance of the comet hitting, the\ntime until impact, and the severity of the comet (The Power of Research);\n\n-  Our\nlong term protection against the waves (The Power of Protection);\n\n-  By\nobtaining insurance, pods damaged from flooding will be quicker and cheaper to\nrebuild (The Power of Insurance).\n\nFinally, it’s\nclear that the “Preparation for risk” affects development after some time. \n\nIf you played the game only once,\nwhat would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if\nyou played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first\ntime? What were the main things you learned from the game?The only once played game, If I would play the game merely\ndifferently (not a “crisis fighter”). I would develop strategies (becoming “proactive and systematic risk managers.”). Indeed,\nplaying stroke of luck without strategies is not rational. One of The main\nthings I’ve learned that is “everything we do has some cost, whether in time of\nresources, such is the way of, the world, where nothing come easy”.\n\n \n\nThe game captures, in a\nsimplified way, some aspects of risk management.

            "reflection": "1) The role of the risk manager was to ensure that there was a balance between the knowledge, protection and insurance aspects of risk preparedness.  The choices I had to make included: when to press the protection button only, when to purchase the insurance and when to purchase the insurance and press the protection button to prevent damage to the pods if the comet hit the island. In addition I had to make choices on when to build he pods and when o protect the already built pods from the falling comets. The trade offs included stopping to build the pods to either continuously hold the protection button or to purchase the insurance.  As for the way preparation affected development immediately was that either, the comet  missed to hit the pods or if it did, there was no damage and therefore, there was no time lost in terms of development  or resources wasted..2) I played the game more than once and this is what  I did after the first time. I went back to the tutorial  and mastered it. It provided very good guidance. and when played the game second time I  made progress up to level four (4) of the game. The things that I learned are a) Knowledge is critical if one is to make the right decision. Decision on when to press the protection button only or press the protection button and purchase insurance at the same time was guided by the information provided on the comets. In addition the speed at which the comets were falling as well as the number approaching the island guided my decision whether to just press the protection button only or to press the protection button and purchase insurance to compliment each other.  2) Protection is important for risk management. By pressing the protection button, the comet would miss to hit the pods. 3) Insurance and protection compliments each other. When comet managed to hit the pod, there was no damage and was relieving to see no lost development as indicated by the development bar. 4) Action taken and on a timely bases makes the difference. I learned that that I had to take action and on timely bases to prevent the comet from hitting a pod or if it did, not to cause damage.3)The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices  that matter in the place where I live  is to add  the aspect of coping ",

            "reflection": "Not withstanding the technical difficulties posted by the game, I can say that the key role of risk managemnt was how to balance in strengthening the community to that of preventing being destroyed using the given resources, protection and insurance. At certain points, I had to choose if I first build my pods or deal with the comets. At times, I had to deal with spending the resources available for constructing the pods or using the resource for protection. I would say that I did not really see the very impact of preparation to risks in relation to development in the game. But definitely, it is preparedness that helps in already winning half of the battle.The first time I tried the game, it was exploratory and then I went more into tactical approach after learning of the resources that I can use. I just started to construct the pods and only then prepared for the comet. I will change the pacing specially when there are 2 comets coming so that response can be faster. It is really the knowledge of where things are, how to use them at a given time and tactically releasing them at a given moment that I learned from ther game. But of course, it is also the winning over after having tried all sorts of approaches; gaining ground since we want to address the risks that are present and could still be coming. It was harder when there were more comets coming at almost the same time and the response (due to lack of resources) is slow. This seem to be the case whenever there were more comts coming.I would propose to have a given and existing security within the community since we are not starting from scratch; e.g. facilities and infrastrcutre that can be improved or further integrated into other resources to a given vulnerable area or existing knowledge that can be further enhanced thus being more concrete and creative.

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was to protect the community from comets hitting our world and causing damage. There were three ways to achieve this, by researching the comets, protection from the comet impact, and insurance. I left protection to the last, every time I tried making that a priority over research I ended up losing the game. My first priority was insurance, second was research followed by protection. Every time I made protection a priority my development was affected immediately. But the further I got along in the game, the lack of protection hampered my development even more. I learned that you can't spend all your money on development. You have to save some for the after effects of the comet. If I were to play again for the first time I would definitely buy the highest insurance first, not the lowest. I would change the initial building of new developments. You would have two options first standard home, the second re-enforced homes that receives less damage but cost double the price. You would have to trade off more expensive development initially for savings later.What would I change to represent risk management choices where I live is a tough question. I currently live in Denmark, but I am from Detroit. In Denmark the worst disasters are typically flooding or loss of employment. Both are well represented with risk management choice in the game, but if I were to use Detroit as a reference I would have to add a \"police enforcement\" option. An excessive amount of looting/riots happens after a disaster, and you need some type of law enforcement to keep the peace, so to speak. I would add training and employing police option each level like the insurance. ",

Reaching those opportunities, however, will always require\nconfronting the risks that block one away from opportunities that lie beyond.\n\n \n\nSuch is a scenario in the “Risk Horizon”\ngame. In the game lies an opportunity to develop an island community by\ndeveloping pods, and building a well-developed settlement. In the course of the\ndevelopment work, there is systemic risk posed by “comets.” In order to proceed\nwith building this community, I had to put in place a mechanism for managing\nthe risk posed by falling comets.\n\n \n\nI had to decide how to properly manage\nthis risk. From the risk management framework presented in the WDR 2014; I\nadopted the framework of using knowledge, protection, and insurance in order to\nmanage the risks posed by comets.  \n\n \n\nThe role of risk management in the game\nwas to assist me proceed with development while managing the risks that I\nfaced. Through knowledge, I sought information on every single comet – its\nseverity, chances of hit, etc. This research was made in order to allow me\ndecide the level of protection I needed prior to each comet striking. With the\nright protection, a strike of each comet left “no damage”, and I continued my\ndevelopment work. With the proper insurance, I would easily recover from a\nshock, by rebuilding damaged pods within a short period of time. \n\n \n\nRisk management is a delicate process,\nand must involve making choices along the development process. Throughout the\ngame, I had to make choices on whether I needed to seek knowledge, get insured,\nor protect myself. Most often, I made a choice of seeking knowledge on each\ncomet before deciding on my level of protection. If, for instance, a comet’s\nseverity was well below by current level of protect, I would opt not to seek\nadditional protecting, as it would increase my protection cost. \n\n \n\nI played the game more than once. What I\ndid differently during my succeeding plays was to invest more time into\nresearch, in order to seek appropriate insurance and protection. \n\n \n\nMy community is often threatened by\nfloods, and if I were to develop a new version of this game, I would change the\ncomets to floods that would destroy the community. By using a risk that is real\nin my community, every member of the community playing the game will appreciate\nthe importance of risk management.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "In playing this game, I tried to be mindful of the risks that those shocks posed and also mindful of the quantity of pods that I have built.  I tried to equate the risks with my pods and then bought protection or insurance accordingly based  on the information that is available when you clicked on those shocks which would indicate the probability of a landfall, whether research would be important/helpful or not.  So given these information I tried to have protection or insurance in place.  At the same time, to maximize the resources I have to build/repair pods or pay for these protection and insurance, I was mindful of the incoming comets.  I felt that there was a trade off between building/repairing pods, accumulating resources to pay for these pods and managing risks.  You have to choose one at any given time.  I was not so sure if this is because I can only work with my right hand - an issue with dexterity or something else?  In reality,all these factors - knowledge, protection and insurance come into play concurrently, albeit at different levels. I do not play video games so it took several attempts before I reached level 3 in this game.  I tried more attempts to see if I can move higher but I did not so I stopped concerned that I maybe addicted.  I tried to see if there was a pattern when shocks would show up so I could predict  and formulate appropriate response but I did not see any or maybe I missed it completely.  I attempted to \"time\" the building or repair of the pods based on the proximity to landfall of those red comets or based on whether there was a high probability of destruction.  In risk management, you actually factor in historical information to be able to predict what would happen and when it would happen. All these scenario analyses use past information and patterns to come up with possible outcomes to be able to act accordingly or decide which solution to take.If I were to enhance this game, I think the decision on whether to click on the comet at any given time as opposed to building/repairing pods would be facilitated if there was an indication how much it is worth.  I had a hard time whether it is the right time to build pods or to click on the comets.  I realize it is not always the case that we can quantify the trade offs were are taking, however it is helpful to know how much it is worth to us i.e. cost-benefit analysis.",

            "reflection": "The Strategic Planning Approach for Alora\n\nRisk\nmanagement is a key and strategic planning tool for the development of Alora. It\ncomprises the accumulated knowledge about the recurrent and expected shocks resulting\nfrom the infrastructure damage caused by comets. The game indeed constitutes a\nmodel of a real life situation on a planet such as Alora.\n\n=The Model.-\n\nRisk\nmanagement is elegantly built within the game. The principal parameters/\ncomponents of a comprehensive risk management strategy are the elements to be\ndealt with in the context of a wider model involving three key dimensions:\nTechnology, Economics and Institutions. \n\n=The\nTrade-Offs.-\n\nProtecting\nAlora is based on the cost-benefit analysis of Protection, Knowledge and\nInsurance, in order to mitigate the impact of comets and thus to avoid the\nrisks of destruction. The balanced allocation of resources is critical within\nthe strategic risk management approach. It is understood that protecting the\nbuilt-physical infrastructure of Alora is based on investing in: 1.- “knowledge\nand technology”, which addresses risk assessment and an evaluation of potential\ndamage based on the evaluation of the size and energy of the comets; 2.- “Protection”\nof the existing infrastructure (e.g., improved building codes); and 3.- “Insurance”\nthat should be considered an investment and a component of risk preparation/\nprevention and guaranteed resilience.\n\n=The\nLearning.-\n\nAnd since\nresources in the game and in the real life are scarce, economic and technical\ntradeoffs are made to achieve the development of Alora’s planet and society. The strategic risk management model has been clearly understood through playing the game.\n\n=The Game.- \n\nI enjoyed\nthe game, once I had a full screen. At first, I had problems with my browser\nwhich prevented me from following the instructions. I opened a different\nbrowser and then I was able to take the tutorial and play the game. \n\nI am not a\ngood player of this type of games. In fact, I played it repeatedly and was not\nable to go beyond Level 2. But I did understand, clearly, the role of the components\nand the tradeoffs involved. I hope to be able to extrapolate from the game to\nreal decision-making in practical life, and to pay more attention to the “risk”\nelement while matching it with the appropriate levels of insurance to be purchased.\n\n=Improving\nthe Game.-\n\nThe game\nitself is a simplified model consisting of three main parameters (Knowledge, Insurance,\nProtection), but the choices/ trade-offs are being made by the player alone. That\nis a single person. The game may need to see how to make it more realistic in\nterms of involving a discussion between a Decision-Maker (Policy maker) an\nExpert (Scientist) and a Citizen of a city or community affected by the shock.\n\nA more\nelaborate version of the game may need to address issues of prosperity in addition\nto resilience. \n\n ",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection\n\n \n\n \n\nIt is risky to take risk sometimes;\nriskier to take risk most times, but the riskiest thing to do is not to take\nrisk at all. \n\n \n\nAs the World Development Report (WDR) 2014 maintains, beyond risks are\noften opportunities. Reaching those opportunities, however, will always require\nconfronting the risks that block one away from opportunities that lie beyond.\n\n \n\nSuch is a scenario in the “Risk Horizon”\ngame. In the game lies an opportunity to develop an island community by\ndeveloping pods, and building a well-developed settlement. In the course of the\ndevelopment work, there is systemic risk posed by “comets.” In order to proceed\nwith building this community, I had to put in place a mechanism for managing\nthe risk posed by falling comets.\n\n \n\nI had to decide how to properly manage\nthis risk. From the risk management framework presented in the WDR 2014; I\nadopted the framework of using knowledge, protection, and insurance in order to\nmanage the risks posed by comets.  \n\n \n\nThe role of risk management in the game\nwas to assist me proceed with development while managing the risks that I\nfaced. Through knowledge, I sought information on every single comet – its\nseverity, chances of hit, etc. This research was made in order to allow me\ndecide the level of protection I needed prior to each comet striking. With the\nright protection, a strike of each comet left “no damage”, and I continued my\ndevelopment work. With the proper insurance, I would easily recover from a\nshock, by rebuilding damaged pods within a short period of time. \n\n \n\nRisk management is a delicate process,\nand must involve making choices along the development process. Throughout the\ngame, I had to make choices on whether I needed to seek knowledge, get insured,\nor protect myself. Most often, I made a choice of seeking knowledge on each\ncomet before deciding on my level of protection. If, for instance, a comet’s\nseverity was well below by current level of protect, I would opt not to seek\nadditional protecting, as it would increase my protection cost. \n\n \n\nI played the game more than once. What I\ndid differently during my succeeding plays was to invest more time into\nresearch, in order to seek appropriate insurance and protection. \n\n \n\nMy community is often threatened by\nfloods, and if I were to develop a new version of this game, I would change the\ncomets to floods that would destroy the community. By using a risk that is real\nin my community, every member of the community playing the game will appreciate\nthe importance of risk management.   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "Risk management was appropriately the main focus of the game. \n\nThe meteors give us risk, the insurance lowers this risk and\nthe protection also lowers the risk but in a different way. Buying multiple pods encourages a support system, and encourages multiple investments, although not to the extent I would like (I will touch on this later). In this game we must evaluate how to manage\nour risk in order to appropriate our money into investments, whether that is\ndirect investment in the pods, or for insurance and investment. \n\nI played\nthe game twice, the first time I was testing it out. On my first try, I always\nkept 75% (best possible) insurance. I didn’t always need it, although I\ndefinitely believed it was worth it, I could spend less time on research as I\ndidn’t feel research was all that necessary. I had a hope for the best, expect\nthe worst mentality. \n\n\n\nThe second\ntime I played it, I didn’t hold such a mentality, I was more willing to take on\nrisk, and I didn’t use as much defense unless I felt like I completely needed\nit, I stuck with the insurance and held onto it if need be.  The extra money I didn’t spend on insurance\nwas used up.  Something I noticed while\nnot using up this money was that the insurance I had was kept to myself. \n\n\n\nSomething\ninteresting: I often used my protection as an insurance, and looked at\ninsurance as a protection, I was less likely to buy insurance if I had a large\namount of protection, even though it usually is the other way around. The\nreason for this is that insurance is a large initial investment, and I’d rather\nspend that investment on pods in order to increase my money and my green bar. \n\nBecause I\nkept money to myself the second game more than the first it could be said that\ninsurance allowed myself to invest instantly, therefore promoting economic\nprogress, which was not the situation the second time I played. \n\nIn order to improve the game, I would allow insurance to\ncost more, because I currently believe the game is set so insurance is highly\npreferable. Also, I believe that multiple investments are not encouraged enough,\nbecause meteors destroy all pods, which is not often the case in real life (ex.\nwhy investors often diversify their stock portfolio). \n\nIn review, I enjoyed the game a lot more than I thought I\nwill, and may play it a couple more times after submitting this review. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "The purpose of the Risk Horizon game is to develop the “Alora” community,\nwhile meeting certain milestones for development. There are 6 levels to the\ngame; but I did not succeed in completing all 6 levels. The game allowed me to understand\nthe value of balancing risk preparation and healthy development. “Alora” is at\nthe risk of falling “comets”, i.e. “shocks”, and  “waves” i.e. the subsequent impacts. At core to succeeding in the game was to\nset and achieve a balance between growing the “Alora” community and preparing\nfor these potential shocks and associated impacts. However,\nthis balance comes at a cost. Preparing for shocks\nand creating tradeoffs among the different elements of risk preparation cost money. Another constraint worthy of mentioning was “time”; we were on the clock! Risk preparation does affect development. Preparing for risks, and the possibility of coping\nwith impacts, paves the way for development; it creates the necessary cultivating environment\nfor development. Progress is not tangible right away, but it is in prolonged continuous risk management that\ndevelopment can be achieved. It is worth noting nonetheless, that risk\nmanagement and development are commensurate. During my\nfirst attempts at the game, I was so wary of managing the risks, that I forgot\nthe primary purpose, which is “development”. Risk management serves development, in preparing and\ncoping with approaching shocks. I lost track of the main goal, but only\naddressed approaching threats. I failed to\nappreciate the underlying trade-offs between development and the elements of\nrisk preparation which exist to serve development as a primary aim, and not\njust to eliminate threats and their consequences. When I played\nthe game again, I made sure to focus on development, while preparing and coping\nwith risks as they occurred. I had to pay attention to two things:(1) the\ndevelopment bar, to keep close watch on the development progress; and (2) The\napproaching commits, to check the severity, the chance of hit, and how much\ninfo is known about each. For starters,\nmy main aim was to develop pods to meet the required development\nmilestones. During this development process, I “kept my eyes on the horizon”,\nwhile looking out for those approaching “commits”. At core to this was to make sure\nthat the preparation efforts are well in place. I kept monitoring the approaching commits, and making\nsure that the degree of severity matches the protection measures put in place. I purchased sufficient\ninsurance coverage, which\nwould assist in coping with the shocks and avoiding significant\nconsequences to the ongoing development efforts. Research was also\na core constituent in preparation, serving to provide the\npertinent knowledge to understand these shocks, their conditions and potential\noutcomes, thus reducing related uncertainties; it also created\ncommunity connections, and this reflected the collective role of all parties in risk management.The game was a good “model” that allowed\nus to put into practice the acquired principles concepts of risk management. This game\nsurely reflected the trade-offs and synergies involved in risk management for\ndevelopment. It provided a good tool to understand the concepts acquired during\nweeks 1 2 of this course, in an interactive and fun manner. Following\nthis game, I am confident that I have fully acquired the basic concepts of\nrisk management. I understood the importance of risk preparation, in that all three\nelements of “protection”, “research” and “insurance” serve development and\npave the way for a growing environment and community. All we need to do is keep\nour eyes out on the horizon, while keeping at core the importance of\ndevelopment as a primary aim, which all other elements stand to serve. All elements\nof risk management are well represented in this game; however, what the game does not cater for is\nthe presence of two or more simultaneously occurring risks. This would in fact\nadd complexity to the game, but it is interesting to see this happen.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon game is very interesting game, it is one of the most useful and effective ways to manage potential risks in our community. It's has a leading role in risk management field. The game highlighted the three significance concepts of risk management for sustainable development. which is research or knowledge of risk mapping, protection and insurance. I think these concepts are very important for any risk reduction and  contingency planning. From the gram and to be more practical, if we going to manage any potential risk in our communities, we should simply based our actions and planning on risk mapping, regarding to evidence-based knowledge or research. Without a appropriate data and deep knowledge related to the risk mapping we can not prepare effectively, In case we managed to prepare very well, this well leads to long-term prevention and protection from the any potential disasters that going to hit our communities. \n\nFrom this game I got many practical benefits. Firstly,  risk management is a high priority in our communities, particularity, in terms of long-term planning and keeping our resources functional.  whit risk management we can invest more and more in the limited resources we posses, as well as  have best practices and cost-effective system to keep these resources functioning in our community as long as possible.

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk management was in preparation for the risk (from the comets) that can happen. We had to choose how to spend resources - for building community, insurance, protection, etc. Trade-offs were made between development of new plot and  upgrading of existing one (or upgrade of a more developed to less developed), we also had to trade-off insurance and protection. And higher level of protection had to be traded off to upgrading plots (as there was a much higher cost).Preparation for the risk affected development after some time in early stages of game as affect could be seen after impacts of comets, but immediately on later levels of game as there was a much higher cost for preparations and money could be invested in development of community. It can be said that protection of a developed community has a higher alternative cost.2. I've played game several time. I preferred to invest in upgrading then in building all the plots. (I would even say that this game should that community can't develop on the same level. Some inequality brings a faster and more efficient development for community). On later levels of game I preferred to invest into protection as  more developed the community more destruction were brought to the community and more time and resources were needed to restore it. The game showed again that we have very limited resources and we should think about how to distribute them effectively. It also showed that research is very necessary in order to understand what risk exist, what is their probability and what impact they can make. The game showed the importance of protection that includes preventive measures  and measures that can help to cope with aftermath. It also showed that equality doesn't always allow us to use resources effectively for development.Research had a big influence on how to spend resources. It showed whether we could spend them for building community (if comet wasn't to hit) or to spend them for protection or insurance (if it hit us and how much to spend in dependence of severity). 3. I would add people in a separate group of resources. People are the main consumer of all the resources, they are also the ones who are going to help to cope with aftermath. Less people means less human resources who can work physically or less specialist who know what to do in such situation or who can be a leader in such situation. I would also separate research in several groups - more and less expansive as all the researches have their cost. ",

            "reflection": "Dear friends,\n\nI am really worried about the risk-horizon game. I couldn’t\nsuspect World Bank could use a way of evaluation where some people, like me,\nhave serious problems to reach. But not because cognitive problems. I have had\na lot of technical problems because: internet navegator, broad of internet line\nand similar others. At the end, it takes me more than 20 hours to get an useful\nversion of the game, not because of software, but because hardware problems.\n\nConcerning the game logic, I think it shows the difficult\nbalance governors and authorities have to do. It is necessary to grow, to get\nan economical development, but monitoring risks. Have can we monitor risk? The\nriskhorizon game give us four tools: research –scientific research to know\nmagnitud of risk and its consequecenes, always in probabilities words-,\nprotection –where nobody knows how much protection is needed, but where\nprudential principle is recommended-, insurance –that is needed to buy it in\nthe market- and a special kind of solidarity, that can emerge from the links\nbetween pods.\n\nEvery one of these tools drive to a social system. Research\nto the scientific system, with their own logic. The game shows us the\nimportance of research and so the cost of research. The cost of a scientific system\ncould be very high and its results are so sure as so difficult to see. \n\nProtection belongs to the political system. Specially\ninfrestructure policies of protection that emerge from the status. The traditional\nor modern state is the institution created by societies to reach some common\nprotection. More, we can say protection is the basement of modern state, as is\noutlined by authors as Thomas Hobbes.\n\nInsurance is in the market system. It is a investiment to\ncover the problems in the future. I have to say that this World Bank course\nremarks the importance of the market throughout the importance of insurance.\nWorld Bank wants to teach us that the market is the solution. At least, it is\nthe solution when problems came. But, can the market to solve the problems\nconsequences of big catastrophes, as broad famines, earhquarkes or similar events? I think that\nmarket alone can’t. It is needed the state protection. Insurance is important,\nbut not enough.\n\nAnd\nsolidarity is the last. Then we talk about social tissue. Then we talk about\nsociety system as it is described by authors as German sociologist Luhmann. The\nall game is a society metaphore, but it is not easy to think that links between\npods could be interpreted as solidarity. I believe in solidarity as an important\ntools when misfortunes arrive. Solidarity transform people in actors, in\ncitizens.\n\nBut the game\nis designed from the responsible authorities. The player have to believe it can\nmanage every resources: research, protection, insurance and solidarity. Of\ncourse, you learn the necessity of every tool, and specially the necessity of a\nbalance between them because those resource require money, work and time. A\ncommunity –or a country- could have time. Likely work, if it has a formed\npopulation. But what about the money? In the game, money is there. It is on the\nleft hand of the screen. But what does it happen in real life?\n\n I spite of my (personal) problems of accesibility, I enjoy the logic of the game. A recommendation to next editions: please to think in people with very limited devices or with old and slow computers is required. An institution as World Bank, very concerned to people in underdeveloped countries have to think in those problems, that are very different of comprehension problems.",

            "reflection": "The game was difficult at first, however it was quite\ninformative and insightful and a great visualisation of the potential risk\nmanagement approaches in this scenario. I found the concept of trade-offs very\ninteresting. In particular, it forced me to consider the reality that resources\n(including access to funding) can be a more significant challenge for\ndeveloping countries. It is clear that comprises need to made in risk\nmanagement to achieve the best result with the resources available. \n\nIn the first attempt of the game I did not fully understand\nthe importance of research and networks in preparing for, and responding to, crises.\nIn subsequent attempts I spent a great deal more time researching, which led to\nmore time for community network rebuilding after the crisis hit. As a result, I\nchose to spend less time on last minute protection, to ensure that I could\nspend enough time researching which appeared to have a better result of\nminimising damage. I also spent more money on insurance in the later games,\nwhich in turn led to less resources spent on repairing pods after the crisis. \n\nBy preparing for risk, through insurance, research and\nbuilding community networks, I was able to spend less time reacting to the\ncrisis (repairing). As a result, I had more resources available to spend on building\nadditional pods and developing existing ones. It also allowed more time to be\nspent researching, which allowed greater community networks to form. This shows\nthat investment in risk management before a crisis hits, can have a positive\nflow-on effect and actually save money in the long-term. Prevention may not\nalways be possible; however I would still argue that minimising damage and\nresponse time to a crisis could be considered effective risk management. \n\nProposed change\n\nIf I were to make a change to the game, I would introduce a\nfew different types of crises to show how one size does not fill all with risk\nmanagement approaches, particularly in different locations around the world. This\ncould perhaps be done in the higher levels and would help to demonstrate that\nthe appropriate level of preparation, knowledge and insurance can differ\ndepending on the situation. In some cases, knowledge and preparation may be\nmore important and effective in preventing disaster, than insurance would be\nminimising damage. Likewise this could be the opposite, depending on the\nsituation, location, communities and government in question. Although the game\nshowed different levels of severity and chance well, I think that including\nvarious forms of disaster could be a worthwhile addition to the game. \n\n",

            "reflection": "The dynamics within the game are interesting in the way you need to balance a. research on the risks, b. mitigation measures through networking, c. the need for insurance coverage, and d. the desire to expand the business. this requires thinking simultaneously about these dynamics and seeing how they affect each other. for instance, if the risk (the meteor) will hit anyway, then it don't make sense to suddenly invest and not preserving the needed cash for reconstruction, what is required in this case is to keep on clicking on the mitigation measures to minimize the actual impact of the risk. \n\nIn all cases i opted for the maximum insurance given the increased expected saving, particularly that you get hit all the time with meteors, especially the property in the middle line. So what i did is built three units in the top and bottom and left the center empty, and upgraded them as soon as i could. this allowed me sufficient resources to rebuild.\n\nA critique on this case is that it does not simulate real life situations, who would invest in such a high-risk environment? Furthermore, the insurance compensation was 3-times as much as a the premium in each situation, and we know that real life does not work like that. The game illustrates the key messages, however it could've been designed to be closer to real life situations. Plus, research does not always give you detailed information about the risks, particularly systemic and devastating risks the report and the MOOC discusses. Just my two cents. Cheers. ",

            "reflection": "1)\n\nThe way I perceived the risk management role in the\nparticular game is linked to the first objective of risk management, that\nis the strengthening of the resilience of Alora. According to the Report, \"risk management can produce resilience\nand resilience is the ability to mitigate losses from adverse shocks and to\nfoster recovery\". This objective is met via managing Alora's risks (shocks, that is comets), firstly by identifying each risk/shock (comet) and then by analysing the characteristics of\neach risk/shock (comet), separately. Having done that, it fosters Alora's recovery from any damages and leads to overall development.\n\nAll the aspects of the preparatory process\n(research/protection/insurance) we . However, as I was playing the game, two were the most pivotal factors that were constantly present and impacted\non my decisions: a) the speed of each comet, which\nwas a pivotal factor that urged me to take important decisions under\npressurised conditions and b) the financial constraints.\n\nIn particular: \n\nwith regard to the knowledge/research aspect of the\npreparatory process, I relied on the relevant notification which was available for each\ncomet. This information signalled the level of analysis and research needed to understand\nthe nature and the potential severity of each comet. With regard to the protection\naspect, I was investing in more upgraded pods based on the criteria of a) the\nseverity of the comet and b) the number of comets ready to hit Alora. Finally,\nwith regard to the insurance aspect, I took my decisions based on a) my\nfinancial resources/capacity and b) the number of existing pods (ex. I judged\nthat I needed a higher level of insurance when I had 6 pods than when I had 3\npods).\n\nRisk management affected positively the development of\nAlora via building pods step-by-step (and thus: expanding the areas where I could intervene and provide effective risk management) and upgrading the existing ones, gradually. This helped\nme to create a more resilient system, where I could potentially take more decisions\nfor the benefit of Alora's people as a whole. So, I believe that the developmental contribution was both short-term and long-term.\n\n2)\n\nI played the game more than once, and the main thing\nthat I changed was my approach: I considered all the three aspects of the\npreparatory process ad hoc, based on the dimension which needed more attention according to each shock.\nThe learning outcomes after having played this game was that I realised the\nsignificance of being proactive and of sharing the information with all the\ncommunities/stakeholders present in Alora. This facilitated the dissemination of the\navailable information and knowledge, and led to strengthening the resilience of Alora as\nan entire system.\n\nThe particular online game was a really successful educational tool\nthat helped me bridge the theoretical background gained from the available\nmaterial in the first two weeks, with a virtual implementation of the concepts\nas they are provided by the World Bank Development Report 2014. \n\n3)\n\nA recommendation for the future in the place I live: In the place I\nlive there is a problem in throwing the recycled materials in the proper bins.\nThe target in this case is to change the behavioral attitudes and norms of the\nneighbours, which could be achieved through better education as well as\ndiscussion and a common campaign fostered by the more environmentally sensitive\nneighbours.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to balance insurance, protection and research while also progressing forward with development without stagnating.  As there was and impending and unavoidable risk, I found it best to always purchase the highest level insurance in order to prepare for the worst. I would then build, upgrade and develop while alternating between researching meteors and raising the ground level for protection. My behavior was most risky for the first few seconds at the beginning of each round as I waited to accrue enough money to buy the best insurance, but this paid off as I was never hit during this time.I played the game multiple times as I wanted to achieve the highest possible level.  Each time I tweaked the balance between building, protection and research.  I found it best by the end to build as many structures as possible and then to upgrade equally each level, while owning the highest level of insurance and if time and budget allowed as I was nearing my development goal I would then raise the foundation as I found this more beneficial than researching individual meteors, which became my last priority or a filler task when waiting to accrue money.  I learned to balance impending risk v. expected risk v. unlikely risk and how to balance taking risks for future security and stability.I would add an aspect to where the land didn't just sink back down to sea level when hit but rather to sink below sea level gradually which could simulate added flood risks, earthquakes, sinkholes and negative results from Fracking.  I live in Texas where Fracking is very prevelent and just north of us it has now been linked to earthquakes in oklahoma.  This added aspect of the game would make it to where the  player has to utilized the \"raise land feature\" where as before one can progress through the game without having to use this, it adds another risk factor but also makes necessary to use another tool of prevention to risk.",

            "reflection": "Risk management is the strategy necessary for sustainable development and progress to next level in the game. There are strategies and trade-offs involved in the game which is pretty similar to the real world. I am going summarize my game strategies and trade-offs in this essay.First,  I started the game building 3 plots even though I am capable of building total of 5. I kept the money as savings to rebuild or improve part of Alora that generates income quicker which can be used to develop further. The constant generation of income is important to the rising economy to build and sustain the development. Then, during the development process I chose to research. If the research indicates that a calamity. I stopped the research started investing in the protection against the calamity. Second, Even though I reached level 5 in 5 attempts, I played the game about 10 times because it was fun. The main things I learned during the first 5 games include: develop Alora strategically, look out for comets that is invest time in research, and buy insurance if you know you can't avoid the calamity or if you are not confident enough that you can not rebuild on your own. First time, I ignored research to concentrate on development, which taught me the importance of research. Second, I researched but didn't invest in protection, thinking that insurance would pay off, but the time run off by the time I rebuilt the whole thing. Third time, I pretty much balanced all 4 major areas: development, research, insurance and protection. Fourth and Fifth times I just got better at the game which is pretty good feeling. Third, Yes, Game indeed captures four major sectors for sustainable development: development, research, protection and insurance. If I have the opportunity to change one simple thing that would be to reduce the incidence of comets, in the real world we won't get that many disasters, and not comets for sure. The place where I live in or my parents live in, drought is the main disaster. We should add food and reserves for disasters such as drought and famine. Finally, summarizing my thoughts on the risk Horizon game. The game teaches important features such as research and development. But, game lacks few features such as food reserves or health hazards etc., which represent disasters of the developing countries or the countries where the famine or health are issues. In any case I sent the web link to my friends to spread the good word and intentions. ",

The role of risk management in the game is to establish\nthe practicable internal practice and procedures o tackle risks of the planet\nwhich mainly came from falling comets. The procedures such as the risk response\nprocess and plan before and after the damages came. And one of the most\nimportant messages is to balance the growth and risk preparation. In the game, while\nthe community is growing, its risk management tools include implementation of\nprotection, research and insurance. The player must fully aware of the choices\nof applying knowledge, securing protection or entering into insurance.\nResources are limited. The player should always aware of the available\nresources to maximize the output and minimize the risk incurred at the same\ntime. It is always a rule whenever the player to decide for one action, it will\ncost the player and reduce the possibility of arranging other action. Example\nas I did research to the coming comets, no time to grow the community. In most\ncases, I spent the money in insurance, level up the land or research, less\nmoney could be allocated in other aspects in term of protection or development.\nIt is a matter of trade-offs as the time will not stop to wait for the full\npreparation of risk and it is always the falling comets to create different\ndamages to the developed buildings. Risk preparation cost time and money which\nthey are all core factors to foster the development of the community. The\nplayer allocates their money to build the pods and will become lack of\nsufficient money to purchase insurance or raise security level.In the beginning, the primary strategy was\nto foster growth and develop as many as pods to sustain the cash flow and\nbrilliant future. However, it is totally wrong as proved by the damages brought\nby the comets afterward. Definitely, balance must be considered between\nprotection and development. Thus, when it is the second times to play the game,\nmore conservative act will be implemented such as to purchase more insurance\nand reduce the development speed. The balance and progressive development is\nvery important. After several trials, it was clearly a main lesson brought out\nthat development is not everything; it should be in line with other balance\ndevelopment strategy such as the precautions.This game captures some risk management\nelements, if it is to add more functions; one of critical part is to add human\nbeings in the game. As human beings could always be a driving or destructive\nfactor to everything. It could be very necessary exercise to involve this reality\nthat human may sometimes bring drawbacks to the incident due to political\nreasons. Just like it was happened in some place with serious problem of\npoverty, the role of the officials to put forth necessary precautionary steps\nto the affected area as the first and foremost plan in all risk management\nissues, but corruption of officials lead to the program became insufficient\nfinancial support of the local assistance program and end up the failure of\nthose projects are not rare things happened in real world.",

            "reflection": "Risk management was important in terms of evaluating the\npotential risk and severity of the meteor strikes and how to mitigate the\ndamage from strikes.  I personally relied\nheavily on the research aspect, as this allowed me to ascertain to a greater\ndegree the severity and likelihood of a strike. \nFirst, this allowed me make the decision as to whether the meteor was “worth”\naddressing.  That is, if the severity was\nvery low or it was not likely to strike, I could more or less ignore the\nmeteor.  This allowed me to focus time\nand resources on other more likely and / or severe meteors.  With the severe meteors, because of the time\nspent researching, I was able to react in the event of a strike and limit any\npotential damage.  This meant that I had\nto spend less time on protection, which ultimately led to me losing on level 5.  The damage that I suffered from a severe meteor\nstrike ultimately slowed my development too much for me to be able to reach the\ngoal.  With the time spent focusing on\nknowledge, I also may have neglected the protection aspect.  I might have better spent resources building\nup protection over time, rather than in response to an imminent meteor strike.I might focus more on protection and insurance if I were to\nplay again, though this might decrease development to such an extent that I\nmight lose earlier.  When I played, I\ntended to prioritize funds in the following order: development, knowledge,\nprotection, and insurance.  This was an\neffective strategy in the early levels, though perhaps as the severity of the\nstrikes get higher, it becomes more important to mitigate risk with insurance\nin order to lessen damage from the inevitable severe meteor strike.  This is perhaps analogous risk management in\nthe real world: countries must alter their risk management in the early stages\nof development to address differing needs at various stages of\ndevelopment.  For instance, countries\nmight need to focus on development above all else, in order to address the\nneeds of the population.  As a country\nprogresses through stages of development, it needs to shift it strategies to\nprepare for disasters and shocks, which may both impede future development and\nlead to greater net losses than in the earlier stages.  Finally, as a country reaches a highly developed\nstage, insurance and protection to ensure that all gains are protected becomes\nthe most important aspect.\n\n\n\nIf I could add something to the game, I might add different\ntypes of disasters as well as different types of development.  The differing types of development, perhaps\nsocial, medical, science, etc. would help to increase the knowledge\naspect.  These would then be used to\naddress the new types of disasters, perhaps things such as disease, famine,\nwar.  This would add more of a “real-world”\naspect to the game, though it would of course increase the games complexity.  ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game is to find a balance between the cost of  protection, insurance, knowledge, and coping and future growth cost and speed. Sometimes it seemed legit to stop developing and buy insurance instead. Watching the sky was very effective during the game. In the beginning, I was overly protective. That lead to the situations when the village is save, but it have no resources for development. I bought 75% insurance before any risk shows up on the horizon. That strategy showed that overly protective risk management leads to rapid delay in development. I changed my strategy step by step decreasing the amount of protection used, bought insurance only when the risk was high, and started to watch the sky more closely. This new strategy leaded to a bigger loss after hit of the comet comparing with previous one, but it proved itself showing faster development in the future. After achieving 5th level, I decided to use the strategy more based on coping to see how its will turns out. Unlike the over protecting strategy, over risky strategy showed a fast grow at the beginning and huge loss with subsequent fall development speed. As I see after using these two contrary strategies over protecting strategy seem to be a better choice than over risky. Although it doesn't leave a lot of resources for development, it doesn't put the object of the risk management in crisis either.    The main thing I've learned from this game is that being overly protective takes more time and resources and in the end it doesn't worth it. It could stop you almost completely from developing. Not taking action on the protection or future coping could lead to severe loss and even get you far away from the point you've started. Those conclusions totally make sense in the real life, too. So, as I think, before trying to avoid some risk or protect oneself or company from it, decision making person should compare real risk probability and future loss to the cost of risk avoidance in terms of protection and insurance cost. Not doing anything is worse than doing something wrong, at least you will know your mistakes and get better in the future.   In new  game version, I would propose to include some useful stats at the end of the game such as development speed through the game. This would help to see clearly how the risk management effects development. Also, It would be handy to have well presented cost and benefits of making new pod building and upgrading it. More information on outcomes could be helpful for everyone. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management is critical to the game. Without managing risk, through the purchase of insurance, natural disasters would have destroyed the village and it would be impossible to rebuild quickly. In the beginning but I did not buy insurance, felt I could not afford it.  I found this to be a reflection of my own economic situation.  I began to think that at some point the village would be negatively impacted so to protect the investment I purchased insurance. Investing in construction in the village , while purchasing insurance of various amounts,allowed me  to receive benefits while protecting holdings. I was able to become aware of the limitations of my own thinking patterns.  It affirmed what I learned in the videos of risk perception, personal denial that it can happen to me and that insurance costs were perceived as too high.I did find that some insurance is better than no insurance. Hedging the investment against disaster works as long as the insurer is reputable.Trust is a major issue and must be addressed in incremental steps, there must be some monitoring of the issuers of policies in countries that do not have good fiscal oversight or policies of regulation.Countries committed to infrastructure development addressing specific needs, such as water shelters in Bangladesh, also require political stability.Community based interventions can be very effective when organized to reduce disaster damage and loss of life.  Populations that are marginalized often do not have the alternative to relocate and are allocated the most problematic development zones.The version of the game that I would develop, would offer multiple disasters that may or may not affect the village.  For example, a change of the terrain would alter flood destruction, an existing water course might be diverted with success,or drainage fields to stop water erosion.",

            "reflection": "                I really loved playing the game ‘Risk\nHorizon’. Initially, before the game started, I wondered how a game testing\nrisk management would be like. But after playing it, I realized that it was\nboth interesting and informative. After playing this game one could clearly\nunderstand and also experience the basic concepts of risk management and I also\ndid. I clearly understood that one could not have knowledge, protection and\ninsurance completely with limited resources. Hence there must be trade-offs and\nthat too in an effective manner without losing the balance for development. Initially\nI relied on the knowledge and protection and completely neglected spending on\ninsurance but I couldn’t even cross level 3 by doing so. Then instead of\nprotection I went for insurance and compromised on protection. The results were\nthe same as the previous which made me realize that both protection and\ninsurance are two important parameters of risk management and cannot be\ncompletely compromised by one another. The game is so practical that complete\nknowledge offers more time to have community links that could save the economy.\nI practically experienced how coping could reduce damage. The game also\nstressed the fact that preparation without proper coping and coping without proper preparation are both useless\n\n                The\ngame made me to go for different strategies to survive more levels. Initially I\nsimply developed protection and insurance but failed to develop the pods. The\nnext time when I tried to develop the pods, I ran out of resources as I made\nthe same mistake by simply increasing the protection which made me go out of balance\nwhich is needed for a proper development. Initially I spent valuable time on\nresearching on comets which are less severe and couldn’t find time to research\non comets which are highly severe. This made me understand that if two or more\nproblems approach us at the same time we must be able to prioritize them so as\nto attain minimal loss. I also learned to manage time as to spend time on researching\nwhen I’m not developing pods or increasing protection.\n\n                I loved\nthe game so much that I would really love to develop the game by introducing\nmigration concept to the game if possible, so that one could also learn some\nconcepts like when to migrate in search of better opportunities which could\nreally take this game to a higher level of strategy. Migration can be implemented\nby splitting areas as coastal to non coastal areas.  The pods at the coast must be prone to more\ndamage at the same time must give more resources that others at the interior\npart though both are in same level. The migration must take some time and\nresource to occur. When they were hit during migration the damage caused must\nbe at the maximum than when at the shore so that one could decide when to\nmigrate carefully.\n\n                I hope\neveryone loved the game very much like I did.",

            "reflection": "The game provides an interesting, though oversimplified, application of\nrisk management. Research, protection and insurance all have to be considered\nin order to make it to the fourth level and upper. The players have to adapt\ntheir strategy, if they are to succeed in coping with the tsunamis generated by\nthe falling comets.Committing\nthe right amount of money at the right time lets the player increase his or her\ndevelopment score. But\nthe importance of each variable changes over time. For instance, at some point,\nwhen investment in protection has proved sufficient to efficiently shield\nbuildings from floods, insurance is not much of a factor any more. Again, the\ngoal is to develop, not to indulge in a spending frenzy over protection and\ninsurance. Research stands apart from the two other variables, in so far as it\nis free (which is absolutely not the case in real life). I mostly used research\nas a pastime to fill in the gaps, when I was waiting for money to add up.I\nplayed the game three times in a row, and I got much better at appreciating the\nright level of protection and insurance needed, on a par with the expected\nseverity of impacts. In doing so, I was able to exceed the expectations of each\nlevel and see the green bar fill up rapidly. I understood that costly upgrades\nare not worthy unless the overall development of buildings is balanced - better\nhave many average buildings than a few good ones. And while a responsible risk\nmanager cannot rely on fate alone, I also realized that luck is paramount, as\nthe number of comet hits vary from one to four per turn! My strategy\ncould be summed up as follows: build all pods as soon as possible in order to raise mney quickly, invest in\ninsurance to the max, then, in upper levels, focus on development and protection,\nleaving insurance on the side when protection is sufficient. With this scheme of maneuver, you may be able to reduce the impact of risk management investments on your development.\nI live in a place that is, luckily, not prone to natural disasters. Nevertheless, I can think of a few simple ways the game could be changed in order to better represent\nrisk management choices. First, comet hits should result in earthquakes as well\nas floodings. Therefore, elevation would not prevent all damages, and insurance\nwould be necessary to recover from the hits. Then, research should be paid for,\nas in real life. Research is nothing like looking at the stars, it needs a real\ncommitment. For example, the player could build a telescope and upgrade it in\norder to better assess the risk of impact. And finally, research shouldn't be\ntoo accurate - varying weather conditions from one level to the other could\nimpair the capability to track comets. Overall, the player would have to mix\neven more all three variables to succeed in his or her quest for development.Risk\nhorizon is a funny approach to a handful of risk management principles. A true example of the\nwidespread gamification in nowadays education, it provides a swift look at the necessary balance between development and risk management investments. Its simplicity makes it quite intuitive,\nbut after a few tries, the interest for our little pods  fades away. I would gladly try a renewed\nversion with more difficulties to handle. Thinking of other games involving risk management,\nI would recommend SimCity for those who wish to see their development\nstrategies face a myriad of risks, ranging from natural disasters to chemical\npollution and even crime.",

            "reflection": "The role of the risk management in the game was to avoid loss. I think I needed some time before I could understand the game and its elements i.e. knowledge,protection and insurance. My choices were trade-offs combined with guess work. If you combine the three elements and keep them under command (which is difficult) you could go to higher level. I hardly reached the third level! Was it for my mistake or maybe something was wrong with the game? I am not sure. Maybe both. The most important thing in risk management is the preparation we get to face it, and our preparation sometimes can have very good affects, that can be immediate or even after some time.If I played the game only once, I would have finished maximum the first level. I played the game more than once and could surpass level two, which I consider a success for me. There was something wrong with the game, most probably yes.I can not say what I did differently the second time, but I think I followed the same intuitions as the first time. What was the main thing I learned from the game?I think I learned a lot: how difficult it is to be in control of all elements necessary for managing risk. The more you know, the better it is. Maybe what was missing in the game was the collaboration between actors, just as it happens in real life. Coordination of actions becomes very important in catastrophic situations.As explained above, I had problems with the game. Sometimes you could not understand where  you made a mistake. What we really do (in this game and similar games) is reaction, reaction to an action,which in our case was natural phenomenon. So you can win if you react in time and intensity, and each game should give you these two possibilities.  ",

            "reflection": "I believe that the purpose of this game was to show the need for proper balancing between cost and effectiveness of development and on the other side insurance and protection. It has been demonstrated that effective risk monitoring needs to estimate severity and possibility of damage and compare them with cost of insurance and preparation in order to determine how much to invest in defense, but not to overrate the potential risk. If potential risk is overrated, and to much is paid for preparation, development is delayed. Obtaining knowledge about potential risks, damage and overall impact is crucial for the proper assessment of the required prevention and protection steps. Also, very important issue is recovery after serious damage, fast reaction decreases loss of not making development because of dealing with negative effects. This was not an easy task, while playing the game there was a lot of situations when right decision needs to be made quickly, and there is no second chance. ",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection: \n\nIn the course of playing the game\nI learned a few things about risk management:\n\nThe planet Alora is one that is\nprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one that\ncan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen the\nimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect the\nplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:\nDue to limited resources like time and money. We had to make various decisions\nthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming comets\nwere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the comet’s\nseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as research\ntime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take action\nto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,\nit can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level of\nprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect the\nplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance and\ndevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching a\nhigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In the\nbeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and using\nthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase in\nfinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way that\nit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance and\nprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actually\nlessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances of\nhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet through\nobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according to\nthe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not cause\ntoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protect\nAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role in\nreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one has\nto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower the\ncosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on the\nphysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutive\ntime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better that\nis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I would\npropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to the\ncontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relatively\nfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given this\nsituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions with\nlimited and slower growing financial resources.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1)  Risk management clearly required a balance of the all 4 aspects of risk management as the lectures and readings outline:  Knowledge, Protection, Insurance, Coping all of which cost valuable resources and time which detracted from development.  I focused on aggressive development spending while continuously tracking the comet threats that had the worst severity, the highest chance to hit, and those which moved fastest through the sky.  Once I had identified the most prominent threats, I tried to build up my protection level to match that of the largest/most likely threat or I would buy insurance against it at the last possible moment.  I reached the end of level 5 many times but lost with only small increments left to go on my development bar, which means that I ultimately wasn't spending enough on development in relation to the insurance, protection, and coping aspects.  Additionally, by being persistent with researching at all possible times, I increased my \"community connections\" which allowed me to escape damage countless times.2)  The second and third times that I played the game, I increased my spending on development and reduced my spending on insurance as insurance rarely seemed to pay off especially in levels 1-3.  At times, it seemed like the comets would hit my colony at much higher rates than they were advertised when I researched each threat which was frustrating.  I do understand that sometimes luck is not in ones favor repeatedly though it seemed to be that way more times than chance would actually allow in real life.  Ultimately, a balanced and high capacity multi tasking and management was what was needed, as well as some good luck, in order to make it past level four.  Patience was another key factor needed to make it to that level.3)  As far as what I would have changed in the game, the insurance was almost prohibitively expensive as it seems to be at times in real life.  Not only was it expensive, but if you play the game correctly, especially in the first four levels, it is almost a point less purchase.  That being said, the insurance money that I spent could have been used to progress my development more in order to meet the overall level requirement that I seemed to have missed just by a hair at the end of level five.Ultimately this game was quite fun and I found myself playing it several times more that I thought I would have.",

The game required us to build more and more bots and protect them from comets heading towards them which could cause them damage. We had to cope with the damage caused by those comets by employing a mix of the three major strategies-1)Insurance2)Development3)CopingInsuring the bots helped us to lessen the cost of repairs when they are damaged.The compensation offered for repairing was available in three plans 25%,50% and 75%.THe 75% plan being the most expensive. Development raised the level of all the bots to a certain height and thus protected them from the damage which could have occurred.However, the more the platform is raised the more cost is required to raise them further.Coping involved repairing the bots once the damage has actually been done on the bots.It required money to repair them however if any insurance plan was taken the cost was compensated by the insurance company.Our main task in the game was to make a balance of the above mentioned 3 things so as to minimize the  cost and also keep the bots working so as to fill up the meter and clear the level.When i played the game for the first time i didn't spend any amount on the insurance so i had to spend huge sums on repairing the bots.I was able to clear the first two levels but failed in the third level because a comet struck and i had no money to repair them.I realized tha i should have spent some amount on insurance as well.The next time i played the game i bought a 75% insurance cover so the cost of repairing the bots when the damage occurred was reduced by huge extent and i was able to cope up and successfully cleared the 3rd level.However in the fifth level i failed may be because i didn't spend much amount on development .But my performance improved a lot as compared to the first attempt and i was able to manage the risk better as compared to the first attempt.",

            "reflection": "\n\nRisk management is the identification, assessment, and\nprioritization of risk, in the game I was expected to develop the community to\npotential in the area of providing the social amenities and taking into record\nand cognizance the level of exposure the community stands and the necessary\nsteps required as to ensure the entire population is secured and protected. Though\nI didn’t exceed the second level of the game even though I tried, during the\ngame, I ensure to take insurance policy for my community to cushion the effect\nof natural disasters and also investigate the nature of storms which will hit\nmy community from time to time to enable me rectify the damages. I played the\ngame severally and noticed, trying to protect my community from natural disaster\ncost more and I ended up spending most of the money on that process and so\nrebuilding the community was always impossible. And I decided to change the\npattern of approach by first investigating the nature of storm and following\nthe researcher’s advice on how to advert it. I noticed that sometimes the\nresearcher’s prediction was not always correct and I do well to invest more on\ninsurance and develop my community but before long there is a big hit again and\nthe devastation is great and I observe my insurance and money at hand can’t\ncover for the repair and others. The stimulation is obviously a good one though\non real life issues it might not be applicable, so I suggest a more real time scenario\ncould help improve the game. Take for example the game of chess, monopoly etc.\nit gives you plenty of time to think, plan, strategies and observe which is not\npresent in our game. If we were given time to pounder and carefully put our\nplans to better perspective we will surely make better input and significant\nchange on the game. In the area of making choices on what could help the\ncommunity growth to potential was always difficult based on the absences of\nsome instruments and that kept me in the dark on decision making, I held only\nthe insurance to fall back on, based on the insurance policy outlay to mitigate\ndamages which was not enough strategies to control risk. The orientation also\nwas not condensed enough to get a first timer around and about the game, especially\nin the aspect of risk sharing, I really couldn’t share risk with other\ncommunity and that impacted grossly on my ability to perform intelligently.\nImplementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect of\nthe risks. Purchase insurance policies for the risks that have been decided to\nbe transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided without\nsacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest. It is\nimportant to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floors, earthquakes,\nand so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when\nconsidering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other\ndowntime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs\nof reducing the risk. But I obviously appreciate the effort of the designer and\nalso those that put this program together, the effort they made the niche they\ncreated and more importantly the superb intelligent exhausted to be bring this\ncreativity to potential. Io hope they keep up to this wonderful work and research\nthat is grossly informative to help us not only managing natural disaster but\nalso knowing the numerous risk we face in the face of severe challenges that\ncan harm our effort towards our prosperity.    \n\n             \n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a pivotal role in this game in\nprioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them. Its role can be outlined as\nbelow:\n\n·        \nTo ensure long-term survival of the community of\nAlora\n\n·        \nTo provide immediate protection and relief from\nshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insurance\n\n·        \nTo ensure timely and justified protection at the\ntime of crisis\n\n \n\nImportant choices had to be made for each crisis according\nto its severity. Due to limited resources, it was\nimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimum\nutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching the\nisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basis\nof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance of\na hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I would\nimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gather\nknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal in\nsafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, being\ncomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making a\ntrade-off between risk and resources, I was\nable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.\n\nWhile making preparations for the shock, again a\ntrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due to\nlimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted so\nthat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would not\nupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buy\ninsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on development\ndue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain more\nresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resources\nwas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoided\nby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of development\nslowed down the process of growth of resources.\n\n \n\nHaving played the game more than once, I learnt certain\nvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.\nInitially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize the\nrisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized that\ndevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick pace\nto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary to\nprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, I\nbegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordingly\nspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community against\nthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive the\nbarrage of incoming comets. \n\nThis game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-world\ncrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of time\nmanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct and\njustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.\n\n \n\nHailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize that\ncorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequate\nsocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in risk\nmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a just\nand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice to\nall citizens of the community.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "Hello!I think that everybody wants to develop. You start the game with financial resourced to build the community. And you do. But, as you are aware of the risk of flooding, you start community protection. Everything goes smooth until you see the comet. Now it's time for research and taking actions up-front. As the game time is limited and the comet is coming, you have a moment to decide what is best to be done. Either you buy insurance of smaller coverage or a bigger one in the case of high severity comet, or you can invest in development of the community in the case of low probability to be hit by the comet and flooding as well. Preparation for risk helps to develop. And the results are seen after some time.Wrong choice brings flooding with damage. If no insurance was purchased, then the development is stopped to recover community. Research is the best what you can do at the beginning. Then, basing on the knowledge of the past comets influence, you take the actions on risk management.I have played the game 2-3 times till I have won the first level. I was trying to develop community, to upgrade it as quick as possible, along with research of the sky. I have bought insurance. And that was not enough to succeed. I have better analyzed the research information to take correct actions. Now, even being hit by the comet, no damage was done to community, and I could upgrade or build a new pod.Knowledge of the possible risk is not enough. We should understand the risk and what impact it will have. Thus, we should research the risk to know how to protect ourselves.I live in Moldova, an agricultural country in the South-Eastern Europe. Thus, weather conditions are very important for a good harvest. During last years it looks like we do no have much luck. A cold winter without snow, ground frosts in spring, heavy rains day-by-day, droughty summer, and yield becomes fewer. Farmers are installing weather station equipment, anti-hail nets, in order to protect their crops.We have a big river that brings floods. Some communities have suffered after the flood year after year. The habitants are not willing to relocate to a safer place because of the lack in the financial resources. The state also lacks resources to help all of them. Although the warning about the flood possibility is announced, people are not taking necessary actions. As it was mentioned in this course that people prefer to think that \"this will happen to someone else, not to me\". So we need to change people's way of thinking. It is much easier to blame the state for not helping after the flood, instead of taking actions after the warning.As for the game, I would propose to add another risk like an earthquake. Because in real life we confront multiple risks.Thank you!",

In playing Risk Horizon, I found - after many times failing at level 1 - that insurance is very, very useful, in recovering after a comet strike. I found that in order to achieve success, I had to prepare for that occurrence, and invest in insurance, even if it seemed to be  a loss at that moment. I gladly gave up knowledge and was happy to slow down the development of the pods in order to make sure that I had the best kind of insurance that I could afford at any given time, knowing that even though the probability of being hit hard was not that big, it only takes one heavy blow to make me lose the game. One of the features that would make the game more realistic would be to not take the whole amount that is due for building or upgrading right after you've selected it, but gradually. It would be more realistic to be asked for an initial investment, that would be a portion of the total cost, and then the balance to be taken as the building progresses. I would also allow to pause the building and the development progress, but I would penalize for the pause accordingly (a smaller amount, of course). ",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon was a challenging,\nexciting, and an educational way to practice the concepts of risk, insurance,\nprotection, and managing priorities. \nSuccess required constant evaluation of the threat while conducting a\nsystematic development plan, ensuring proper protection when the threat\nincreased, and once realizing that the protection was inadequate, ensuring safety\nby having a suitable insurance plan in place. \n\n\nWith each opportunity to play the\ngame and using the information from the previous attempt, I was able to learn\nfrom the preceding experience to manage priorities to continue the development\nwhile minimizing the risk and resultant effect. \nAs more positive decisions were made, the easier and more manageable the\nexercise became easier to manage the risk and potential impact.  The game emphasized and rewarded the player\nwho was able to successfully balance protection, insurance, and\ndevelopment.  Just like the real world,\nan unbalanced plan (i.e. too much insurance, protection, or too much\ndevelopment) increased the risk and resulted in failure.\n\nOn future games I would install\nsome kind of “penalty” if the participant’s decisions resulted in negative\nresults.  This “penalty” could simulate\nthe humanitarian disaster that usually follows an impactful event.  Also on a future version I would incorporate\nthe concept of “opportunity” into the game play.  With every challenge, opportunity exists to\nthose who grab it.  As discussed in the\nvideos, there are many examples of disaster turning into success due to the\nefforts of a nation and its people.\n\nThe game clearly articulated the\nconcept of risk management.  In the real\nworld anything is possible; a decision has to be make on the acceptable risk\nlevel and the cost required.  It all\ncomes down to how much risk some one is willing to accept, and the price to pay\nfor that risk level.  Overall, a great\ngame once I figured out the requirement to balance the many competing\npriorities; development, protection, insurance, and time management.  Thank you.",

Second\ntime I started to take insurance as soon as I build the house, 50% insurance in\norder to protect from hit.

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon runs in a virtual environment of almost constant crises, with constant menaces coming from the galaxy and causing earthquakes and floods. Risk management is a must for survival. Development goals are set and risk management is an essential tool to achieve them. When playing, I started to feel that I had to confront some trade-offs. First, I did not know the setting, so I had to learn how things worked there. Second, I had to find the right balance between protection and insurance. They could substituted each other one time or another, but had to be used together most of the time. All that preparation for risk affected development in both short and long terms. It made immediate survival possible, but also created the basis for sustainable growth. I played the game all Sunday long, until I completed it, and the reason was learning more than addiction. As stated above, I had to discover the right trade-offs for both immediate survival and long-term development. The first times I used most of my resources for protection and insurance, but I noticed that such a behavior would drive me to get stuck in the third or fourth level most of the times. By managing risk in an aggressive way, I burnt resources that would be necessary for building. Sometimes I ran out of money, so development was suddenly interrupted, and sometimes I spent so much time building protection that I could not finish the buildings on time. Those situations made me realize that I had to moderate my strategy and diversify the tactics involved, so I started to monitor the sky in a closer way. I noticed that by doing that I activated the community, which worked as a kind of insurance. It was not so costly as insurance and it did not consume my development, as protection did. Anyway, I had to combine the three tactics while keeping an eye on the development progress bar and calculated how a specific kind of growth at a level would affect next steps. I started to save some money from one phase to the next and tried to build just as much as necessary, so that growth was effectively sustainable. I also noticed that I could take advantage of calm moments to build protection. Since protection building demanded quite a lot of time, working on it was easier when the sky was reasonably clear. This was easier during the first levels and, since protection was transferred from one level to the next, I decided that I would build most of it during levels 1 and 2. I tended to stop at 3/4 of the bar because it was possible to complement the protection with community links and insurance. If even taking all due care I was hit, I tried to fix the buildings ASAP, in order to be able of go on growing and upgrade the buildings. As I got more experienced, I stopped using insurance at the first levels of the game. I preferred to invest in it at more advanced levels, when I had a reasonable amount of buildings to be protected. I only got to complete the game once the strategy was clear in my mind, I had some experience and learnt how to combine the managing tactics smoothly.If I had to add some element to the game I would choose some kind of stamina. I imagine there is a psychological stress involved in risk management, which tends to worsen as time goes by and crises get more severe. It would be a human touch for the game.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was immense for the game. The\ngame centered around managing funds which needed to go into both development\nand risk management. One would need to devote most of their resources toward\ndevelopment to meet the goals assigned by the game but to also defend against\nthe attacks with either preparation i.e. protection or coping i.e. insurance. It\nreflects risk management in real life by putting development thresholds that\nneed to be surpassed instead of focusing purely on the risk itself. As in real\nlife when economic and social development are put first. Whilst playing the\ngame I was confronted by multiple trade-offs. I had decided to follow the\nadvice of the course instructors and sought active risk management in this case\nincreasing protection to the level necessary to protect the pods. Risk\npreparation immediately affected development by restricting the funds necessary\nto build or upgrade pods. \n\n            I played\nthe game two times. The first time I played I bought insurance while the second\ntime I did not. I actually spent less on knowledge but more on developing the\npods. The development goals were rather demanding and required the lion’s share\nof resources just as in real life. The main things I learned from the game were\nthat only near maximization of resources would be sufficient to meet\ndevelopment goals while at the same time defending against crises. Careful\nplanning is also required. Knowledge is also important for actively preventing\ncrises. \n\n            If I were\nto change one thing about the game it would be to increase uncertainty.\nUncertainty about both the resources put into development and the crises\nthemselves. As stated in the lectures a primary reason actors put too little\nresources into risk management is that crises are relatively few and far\nbetween in most parts of the world. For example in my country, Mongolia natural\ndisasters and social upheaval (although economic crises are common) are very\nuncommon leading policymakers and individuals to assume that risk is\nnonexistent or far into the future. In addition to this many times resources\nput towards development never achieve their stated goals be it corruption,\nmismanagement, or environmental factors. If the game had much more uncertainty\nin resource investment in both protection and uncertainty about the crises it\nwould be more realistic. For example protection being needed less and\ndevelopment having a chance of failing. Oftentimes even the most well planned out programs fail due to mismanagement or corruption in the operational level. \n\n            ",

The main objective of the game is to save the city from destruction, as well as building up a strong economy to pass through the levels.The role of risk management in the game is very clear, because you have to be well aware of iminent risks, conveying planetary and economy risks, to play the game I used a simple strategy that is enough to play and earn a lot of money at the samen time. Once I had the money I invested it on building bigger houses and that would give me more money, but I was always watching the skies to learn about the meteorites, I prepared myself with the suficient protection for every meteorite, not one line more not one less, and also It did not matter if it was going to crash with our planet or not; using that strategy, buying policies was not necesary, not even once, therefore the money was always in use of protection or investment, preparation is essencial to survive to the end of the game, and you can only do that If you are well aware of what is happening in the skies and preparing with the enough protection, not more not less.I played the game two times, for the first one, I tried to protect myself too much that my economy was not enough to pass through the fourth level, because my protection was always at the maximum level. Conversely to the second one where I learnt that aquiring valuable information of the potencial risks and how to be prepared for them, I played a different role, where the main objective was to make money with the leas resouce invested in protection, and with that in mind, my game ran smoothly and I beat the game easily.If I could chance something to the game, that would be to add one more risk, hence another kind of protection, and that would make the game more realistic, conveying not just one but more risks involved in our everyday life, that would make the game even more fun and entertaining and the simulation would be more profund to make better reflections of the risk management importance in our lives.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk managementThe planet is constantly under threat from meteors which can cause devastating damage to the community. The severity of damage is influenced by the type of meteor collision, the degree of preparedness through research and community links, and the financial and structural resilience. Although meteors vary in their impact, the risk of frequent collisions is a predictable natural disaster, much like the annual monsoon floods experienced in Bangladesh. The game showed that despite being able to forecast the risk, it is difficult to recover fast enough after each shock to develop and build coping strategies for the next shock.In this model, knowledge was gained by the time-consuming process of studying meteors, which was at the expense of spending time developing the community. Judgements had to be made about which meteors posed the greatest threat, and resources allocated proportionately. Protection was offered from better building infrastructure (upgrading pods) and better community connections (through shared knowledge). Insurance was helpful for coping with the financial costs of repair after a shock, but cannot prevent the damage happening in the first place. All these approaches to risk management had to be balanced within time and money constraints.What would you do differently?In the first couple of rounds I was still learning how to play the game, since the instructions were not particularly clear. Once I understood how to build connections in the community, I invested more time in researching the meteors to facilitate this. When I reached level 3, I also began to understand the importance of upgrading buildings for resilience, so I experimented with focusing on having fewer, higher quality buildings. I did not try the game enough times to determine if this strategy was more successful.I played the game several times, but was never able to get above level 3. Eventually I became frustrated at my inability to learn and improve, and quit trying. I suppose in the real world this would correspond to leaving a high risk enterprise, or a leadership role in an at-risk country, if I was unable to cope with shocks. If I had the option, I would seek knowledge and feedback from people who had played the game before. What changes would you propose?The game is very much a unilateral approach to risk management, and I felt I was making decisions in isolation. I would prefer there to be an option to consult the community that lives on the planet for their views (which would also be a more accurate reflection of dealing with incentives and behavioural barriers to risk management), and also to consult expert colleagues (and learn from the experiences of other planets?) I would also like to be able to gain knowledge on my game playing strategy beyond simply the meteor statistics given, so that I could figure-out how to improve.",

            "reflection": "The role was that of making decisions about how to use resources to enhance the development of the island. It was necessary to set priorities of two main resources- time and money, either to prepare for disasters (comet hits) or to build up a more prosperous communities (building up pods). The preparation for the disasters involved also different phases, first researching on how probable and how severe would a comet hit be; second deciding upon lifting the island to protect the pods according to that impact equation; and third, purchasing an insurance to make reconstruction cheaper. It is interesting to see how although preparation for risk was achieved by \"lifting\" the island for protection, this measure reduced notoriously how well the \"development bar\" performed. Such a decision in the game gives me a very clear glimpse of what people and governments have to deal with when they seem not to make the \"obvious\" decisions of remaining on safe zones-- this is, focusing too much on protection would not allow enough investment in developing the pods.This has to do with the answer to the second question; the first times I played I failed in the first level. On the one hand because I did not realise how important it was to improve the pods (which means that as a decision-maker I missed key information about opportunities) and on the other hand because I did not manage time very well. So there is also an element here of learning as you fail; once I got the importance of not only making damage almost improbable but realised that it was necessary to take some risks and balance the budget to look for better outcomes, the results improved. And finally, there is an issue of cummulative preparation; developing the pods allows you to be better prepared for the future levels as you will have a higher revenue; buying an insurance is a time-constraint measure and you only make sure that reconstruction is not too expensive.And for the last question, I would allow the development of the pods to be done according to two options: one with a higher retun rate for the investment (let's say, industrial) and the other with less vulnerability to comet hits (let's say, agriculture), so the decisions upon whether or not to protect and whether or not to buy an insurance are correlated to a greater extent with those of how much time you have to achieve the development goal versus the need to mitigate the risks.",

            "reflection": "1. The role of the risk\nmanagement in the game is to keep the right balance between all the components\nat the right time. The game also requires one to make preparations for the upcoming\nrisk by adopting various means. Through community linkage, the game also\nprepares one for coping \n\n Protection, Insurance \nresearch – all of them were important. I made choices depending upon the severity\nof the comet. Insurance was must. Too much of research was not necessary, but\nsome research definitely helped. Protection was more or less continuous. Once\nthere is a strike, community linkage helped. Sometimes while repairing the pods\nfunds reduced, so I could not buy the high price insurance resulting in high\ndamage. \n\nPreparations for risk helped\nin reducing the impact of the comet strike. Having insurance beforehand helped\nin spending less money on the repairing of the pods. For reducing the impact\nimmediately community linkage helped.2.  I played the game several\ntimes, first failing at level 1, then level 2, then level 3 and then level 4.\nWhile playing the game more than once I understood different components better\nand the relations between them. I tried to figure out when the comet strikes\nmost, but could not figure out. The risk of comet strike  damage thereof remained\nuncertain throughout. \n\n After the first time I\ntried to gain information on each component, observed the time to reach each research\nbar, checked the information bar for each comet, especially severity \nchances of strike. I also worked hard to protect the pods  raise the meter\nbar. \n\n The learnings from the game\nare: \n\n-         \nTo begin with it is very\nimportant to have information on various factors that can affect the impact of\nthe risk – both positively  negatively. In the game it is about the\nseverity of the comet strike, chances of strike, research need, cost of\ninsurance, etc.\n\n-         \nIt is always better to know\nmore about the risk coming so that you get prepared for the impact. This also\nhelps in coping.\n\n-         \nOne should not panic in an\nemergency situation. This may lead to more damage. In the game when more than\none comet comes at a time, then I got panicked. I moved from one action to\nanother, without completing one. This led to failure.\n\n-         \nInsurance helps a lot in\ncoping. \n\n-         \nThere is only limited\nresource, so balancing is very important.  \n\n\n\n3. I work for the health sector. Health insurance is\na major component of my work. Getting the community to buy health insurance is\na huge task. People do not seek health care till the later stage. They also do not\ngo for health insurance in spite of the knowledge they have on the benefits of health\ninsurance even if they can afford it. So there is a need for behavior change\nboth at the level of accessing health care at an early stage and have a health\ninsurance\n\nIn this context I would like to add the component\nof behaviour change in the game. This should show how behaviour change leads to\nmore gain and prepares people to confront the risk and coping better.  \n\n",

            "reflection": "\n\n\n\n The role of risk management was\n     critical in leading my decisions. It allowed me to make my choices and\n     decisions on the level of severity, the chance of the event to happen and\n     research to minimize uncertainty. In addition, I relied on available\n     resources and incentives or rewards. In fact, knowledge or information,\n     insurance and protection have also my considerations for preparation.\n     Preparation for risk affects development due to the fact that it uses\n     resources upfront for knowledge, protection and insurance therefore\n     diversion of some development resources for such preparation or interventions.\n     However, it benefits development as it helps to avoid or minimize the\n     adverse impact of the risk that may regress back the hard won development\n     and investments, social, economic and political advancements. On top of\n     that, the resource needed upfront for preparation as well as after the\n     event for relief, recovery and reconstruction is small if preparation is done\n     as risk management. In fact, assets, human capital, social cohesion, life\n     saved or protected. In addition, development path will not be\n     significantly affected by the event and my nation will be of its track\n     within a short period of recovery. In addition, in my role as a decision maker,\n     I learned the importance of integrated tools and coordinated intervention\n     of risk management institutions. This means, one toll or institution along\n     is no sufficient to ensure effective risk management. This prevents fragmented\n     and short sighted intervention and promotes harmonized and aligned intervention\n     of risk management.\n I would like to optimize the\n     balance between development and risk management investment (preparation as\n     well as coping). I mean, I allocate resource in a way that it will be optimally\n     used to maintain the development effort and invest on risk management to\n     protect such development and exploit opportunities to be emerged from such\n     risk management.\n Well, I would propose a sort of\n     indictor that represents availability of stable institutions that\n     responsible in dealing with effective risk management. It is well pronounced\n     in the course materials that one of the failures of effective risk\n     management is the absence of committed and stable institutions that apply\n     such risk management tools. If such institutions are in place, averting or\n     minimizing the adverse impact of the obstacles (misaligned incentives, Lack\n     of information for decision, unaccepted behavior, resource limitation)to\n     risk management possible when we say responsible, it means ethical and professional\n     in applying the reels and regulations. Otherwise, the financial crisis\n     that some times said to be emanated from unethical practices of management\n     and staff is damaging and even aggravates or contributes or become a cause\n     for risk and crisis promotion.\n\n\nIn conclusion, I tried to apply or use the components of effective risk management\nsuch as \n\nKnowledgProtection\nInsurance\ncoping(recovery\nand rehabilitation or reconstruction using sources generated form insurance,\nsaving etc) \n\n \n\n",

What choices did you make and what\ntrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?\nIn what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after\nsome time)?\n\n The role of risk management in the game was protecting through\ninsurance to recover from uncertainties and exposure of hazard. Knowledge is\nrequired for early recovery and insurances are required for minimizing losses.\n\nDepending upon the level of hazard and the likelihood of occurrence\nof disaster, the research was conducted to minimize impact of hazard and\nrecover through insurances. The preparation of risk is important task, most\noften neglected but plays significant role in early recovery or minimum losses\nif the disasters are unavoidable. Risk management is a trade-off between\nknowledge, protection and insurance, lots resources are required for knowledge\nwhich could setback development and protection but the resources for recovery\nare less in comparison to actual losses. The appropriate insurances minimizes\nlosses and early recovery from disasters.\n\n 2.    If you\nplayed the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it\nagain? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do\ndifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from\nthe game?\n\nThe different choices of research, insurances, wise use of\nresources were carried out with trial and error way. This task showed that disaster\nrisk management is a complicated and we have to deal with uncertainties. Risk management\nis part of the development effort but it is inherent to development work so\nthat properties and lives are saved.\n\nRisk management averts damages and prevent development setbacks,\nprovides opportunity to understanding the environment in which risk and\nopportunity are equally embedded and the focus should be to increase\nopportunity. Reduce possibility of loss and increase possibility of gain.\n\nRisk management requires preparation and coping (updating\nknowledge and deploying insurance and protection). Knowledge can increase protection\nand insurance to cope with losses and get benefit.\n\n \n\n 3.    The\ngame captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine\nyou are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to\nchange or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better\nrepresent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\n To better represent the Disaster risk management, I would propose\nto add knowledge as a foundation to simulate the game so that there is clear\nunderstanding of importance of knowledge for the protection of vulnerable\ncommunity and the preparedness to insure safety (life and property) in a better\nway to cope with disasters in a sustainable way.",

I may have even cursed - in Lumination vernacular of course.It wasn't until I returned to the tutorial to realize my mistake.  Which was underestimating the importance of gaining community support.  (Playing the yellow dots like a game of whack-a-mole.)Balancing resources and gauging when to start development was extremely tricky and required a blend of patience, adequate research and thanking the planetary heavens.  Several occasions of cosmic \"missed\" encounters brought a smile to my face and a fist pump to the skies.  Conversely, when research indicated low Severity and a low Hit factor but, nonetheless ended up in over 50% damage - I was depressed, down-trodden and wanted to catch the next galactic shuttle home.Being from Florida/St. Lucia and having withstood numerous Cat 1-5 hurricanes, mud slides, and flooding - I had a sense of nostalgia being on Alora.  It was not hard to gather a relative empathetic sense of knowing and understanding the difficulties with this lifestyle - the proverbial: thrill of victory; agony of defeat mantra.  I, indeed, persevered and made it thru Level IV to grab my 10% academic prize (opportunity).  There was no pomp and circumstance.  No bells ringing, no ticker-tape parade and no dancing with the stars.  Just the satisfaction that I learned a lot and benefited tremendously by the experience.   So I guess for me, it was both a game and my reality. Sidebar:  Since risk managements ultimate resource is people, I thought it might be nice if the game were to add people getting emergency assistance (after shock)) and then returning \"healthy\" and capable of providing knowledge, experience and assistance as another resource.  I really want to see what an actual Luminator looks like.",

            "reflection": "In the game, the role of risk management was to mitigate the\ndamage to the pods that were caused by the comets. This was in an attempt to\nimprove the benefits of growth and prosperity for the pods with the aim of\ngrowing and improving the benefits to the community.  I made the choice to always make sure I bought\nthe highest amount of insurance as possible, even if this meant increasing the\nnumber of pods at a slower rate. At first, a trade-off that I made in terms of\nknowledge was that I did not understanding how to connect communities or the\nimportance of connecting communities to increase the development bar. In terms\nof protection, I therefore made the choice to forgo the use of community\nconnections to increase my development bar, in exchange for a higher amount of\ninsurance which I paid for with money. There were times, however, that I did\nhave to buy cheaper insurance as I could not afford the more expensive\ninsurance whilst also growing pods. I initially found that I prepared too much\nwith the purchasing of insurance and research and as a result, did not make\nenough pods to win the first few games I played. \n\nIf I played the game only once, I would focus less on\nprotection and insurance and more on growing more pods. I would also do more\nresearch to enable me more time to build communities. This stems from the main\nthing I learned from the game, which is the importance of including community\nand strengthening community to ensure that if a risk does become a reality,\nthere is a greater chance that the community will pull together, create a team  and work together to survive. I also\nappreciated how people would be more willing to take more risks if they have\ninsurance backing their actions and that taking more risks leads to greater\nopportunities to grow and develop. \n\nIf I could change one thing in the game, I would involve the\nconcept of ‘incentives’ which is an obstacle to managing risk. I would have\ndifferent scenarios which the game presents to the game player and require the\nplayer to choose an outcome. For example, a scenario where the player is a government\nofficial or a private company owner who are tasked with influencing how the\ngame will proceed and how their actions will affect risk management.   \n\n",

            "reflection": "The Risk Management in the game was trying manage the risk of the meteor hitting the community vs developing the community. I the game the choices that had to be made was around developing and growing the town (which is needed) and knowledge/ researching (which took time), taking insurance and Raising the city (Protection) which took Time and Money. However as I came to find that each impacted each other so all the activities had to be done together to ensure that I could move pass the level. At some points I chose to develop more or raise the city to its maximum as I thought that was best for the city at the point in time given the risks around. Preparing for the risks up front at the start of the game allowed continued Development as the city was not affect or was not affected as badly. It cost little to no money to recover from a disaster which meant that one could continue developing further and not spend the time and money repairing.I played the game multiple times, and generally I got further in the game each time. This happened as I learnt how to ensure I do all that was necessary to manage the risk. On my first try I was only concerned with developing which did not get me far. Then I was only concerned with the meteors that would do the most damage. So when there was a meteor that had a high severity and low change of impact I took all the time raising the city and in the end it missed. By the time I had reach level 6 of the game the main things I had really learnt was that in order to be successful one must be able to focus on multiple things at a time. You had to be aware of the meteors in the sky what the severity was and the chance of success. In addition you had forecast that if it hits it will lower your protection so your protection must be high enough to cover the one that is right be hind it cause you don't have time raise the protection or do more research. The importance of having your hands in different pots becomes very important on reflection in risk management.  Overall it was a great game and if I had to make any improvements so that it could better represent  the risk management choices that matter in the place I live I would try to make more human. The greatest risks where I lived are cause by humans mainly crime. So hindrance to development come from a more social aspect and not such a supernatural out of this world element. I think the natural disaster risks are important to manage but even in these they some times come down to the human risks. Imagine you build shelters but the food is stolen or destroyed. The greatest risk comes from Humans and that should be address in the game to make it even better. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in Risk Horizon is to facilitate the\ndevelopment of a pod community by implementing knowledge, protection, and\ninsurance components of risk preparation. The game challenges users to choose\nan individual or integrated group of components to appropriately use in a given\ncontext. This mission, in addition to dealing with limited funds and time\nconstraints, represents the challenges of achieving optimal outcomes of\nsuccessful risk management: to reduce the losses and increase the benefits that\ncan occur in the presence of risk.  \n\nI played the game numerous times. My first\nfew attempts consisted of failures within Level 1, during which I focused all expenses\nand time on creating a perfectly integrated system of preparation components\nthat could successfully manage the impact of shocks brought on by comet-causing\nwaves. Needless to say, I failed to manage the development of the pods before\nmy finances dissipated and the time ran out. These various trials taught me that\nunderstanding the goal of risk management is different from being able to\nsuccessfully implement it; I realized the complexity and vitality of finding a\nbalance between fostering healthy development and preparing for risk. \n\nI purchased insurance at the beginning of\nevery level; ensuring the presence of insurance served as a risk management\nstrategy for any remaining uncertainty after the implementation of research and/or\nprotection. This reduced the necessity of spending too much on ensuring\nprotection and additionally allowed the development bar to continue rising. However, I was forced to confront some trade-offs between protection\nand insurance when there was not enough time to wait for the island to rise to\nthe shock severity point. In these occurrences, the only option was to purchase\nthe highest rate of affordable insurance and hope there would not be any\nremaining structural damages to fund.\n\nThe research and knowledge component proved\nto be the most important member of the interlinked preparation strategy.\nResearching provided me with cash to fund development as well as the option to\nincrease protection through community connections. In some high-risk contexts,\nI was forced to confront a trade-off situation between the knowledge and\nprotection components. When the price of protection had risen dramatically and an\nappropriate rate of insurance was already purchased, time constraint forced me\nto allocate all remaining funds to community development. The only way to reduce\nthe potential of loss was to substitute protection with research. Researching the\napproaching comet for a prolonged period of time provided me with the chance to complete\nnumerous community connections, therefore increasing protection and reducing\nlosses.  \n\nIf I could add something to Risk Horizon in the context of my\nhometown, I would make the island larger and have an element of the game\nincorporate the risks associated with distance from the coast. I believe that\nthis would add a realistic, yet simple, dimension to the understanding of\nhealthy development and risk preparation. ",

            "reflection": "The game was designed simple yet educational. At the start\nof the game, it was apparent that the risk would be the destruction and harm\nbrought about when the comets hit the planet or shall we call it the location\nof development. So to mitigate this risk, purchasing insurance and building\nprotection was imminent. However, players should learn that other risk surfaces\nas the game proceeds. An example of such risk was under investment to develop the\nplace. The risk of under-development is financial failure caused by\ninsufficient income generation. In the aspect of this game, the player would\nfail to reach the next level as he did not make enough income. \n\nIn my opinion, after having played the game, the role of\nrisk management in the game was to strike a balance between investing or taking\nopportunities, protecting and insuring. I usually trade off insurance for protection\nat the beginning of the game as spending on protection is more cost efficient\nthan getting the higher level of insurance. And through experience, I believe building\nup resilience is very effective for dealing with the aftermath of disaster. The\ndevelopments took lesser time to recover from the damage caused by the disaster\nwhen preparation was adequate. The ability to react fast and take action fast\nwas also very crucial. Preparedness and responsiveness could reduce the damages\ncaused by the disaster to the minimum. Nevertheless, I also believe in the\nadvice that a little goes a long way. For that reason, I purchase the minimum\nlevel of insurance even when the chances of being hit were low and the severity\nof destruction was also low. Having just sufficient insurance without over-spending\non it is also a key point in risk management.\n\nI played the games a numbers of times. The main things I did\nwhich were always different from the previous attempts were to try to strike a\nbalance between investing (developing), insuring and protecting. Gaining the\nknowledge about the disasters that could strike was crucial as the steps taken\nto mitigate the harm brought about by the disaster would depend on it. To maximize\nthe benefit of insurance, I build up my asset to earn enough income to purchase\nthe maximum level of insurance. Having the maximum insurance reduced the\nfinancial burden that I have to bear when harm was done by the disaster. \n\nDevelopment should coincide with information gathered on\ndisaster. The right amount of development should come at a right timing. Development\nshould hold to a certain extent when there is information that a severe\ndisaster in inevitable. This would reduce the cost for dealing with the\naftermath of the disaster.\n\nIf I were to improve the game, I would:\n\nProvide more information on disaster as the stages of the\ngame progress. (For example: Stage 2 information would be more available than stage\n1 and so on.) This is because the main thing that would upset the progress of\ndevelopment is the strike of disaster. As in real life, I believe that past\nevents would build up the experience in managing risks. More information should\nbe available as time goes by. Information is of paramount important in risk\nmanagement. The improvement on information provision would enable players to know\nin advance the probable damage caused by the disaster and thus plan for the\nrequired insurance and protection. \n\n",

            "reflection": "In the game, risk management makes it less likely to be hit by a disaster, and made the negative consequences of disasters less severe. I made the choice to invest early in insurance, then in knowledge and finally in protection, which means that I made a trade-off in between those various sorts of risk management approaches. Preparation for risk affected development insofar as it slows down development in terms of the time one can devote to it and the money available to development.I played the game several times. After the first time, I invested more in risk management. What I learned from the game is that being willing and prepared to invest in risk management, and prioritizing such investments is necessary but not enough - much is still left to chance. For example, if one is hit by a disaster just before the time of the level is up, then one can't really win the level because there is insufficient time after the disaster to repair, and this is the case even if investments in risk management has been maximal.If I was tasked to develop a new version of the game, I would add the political dimension of risk management - it is frequently politically expensive for elected officials to invest in long term risk management, while election cycles are typically short.  ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was to prepare for impending damage, suffering or loss. Further, it helped to properly manage the damage, suffering, and loss due to unseen or foreseen events. Knowledge was useful when advancing to the next round because it helped to make key decisions in choosing insurance over elevation of the island or conducting research to further gain protection against an asteroid hit. So, I mostly relied on insurance and knowledge to advance through the game. Protection by elevation of the island was time consuming and easily lost if there was significant damage from an asteroid hit. Plus, research I feel provided a better option for protection. Preparation for risk helped to rebuild in reasonable amount of time due to the level of advancement of the colony. The more moderate homes were cheaper and took less time to rebuild compared to the more advance ones. However, the greater the development of the colony the more points and options I was able to gain in order to advance to the next round. So, that was a trade off as well I think in playing the game. It took me numerous tries to advance to second level and beyond each time learning more about the game until I was able develop a routine to ensure advancement and quickly repair my colony. I found that purchasing insurance right away and building a few homes was valuable to continue playing the game. Mainly, what I learned from the game is that there is no full proof protection plan that will ward off any type of risk. Risk or calamity is very real and part of our lives everyday so its important to consciously realize that and not ignore it. I think its more dangerous to believe that an individual can somewhat predict the level of risk that on may be subject and therefore not adequately prepared for it.I would implement an evacuation plan to the risk management plan. I feel that losing loved ones has a longer effect on an individual than losing possessions. Material possessions can replaced and rebuilt but losing someone that hurts more and that same sentiment should a priority and responsibility of the governing body. Urging people to leave when the risk to great is important especially if there are systems in place to effectively plan for such impending events that have the ability to cause much damage. ",

            "reflection": "1.      \nThe primary role of risk management in the game\nwas to mitigate the effects of impeding shocks to ensure developmental goals are achieved in the stipulated time. I made\nthree key decisions at the start of the game:a.      \nAlways buy insurance at the start of each level\nas I knew I would not have enough time to build protection while ensuring I\nmeet the developmental goals.\n\nb.     \nDevelopment was always kept at ‘yellow’ on the\ndevelopment gauge and when it turned ‘green’, I would channel resources to\nbuild protection.c.      \nDedicate time to research as it provided me\naccurate information on the chance of being hit and whether my existing\nprotection was sufficient to mitigate the likely severity of the impact.Building\nprotection potentially jeopardises development as it channels resources away immediately. However, ensuring there is adequate protection and insurance is essential as it not only reduces the damage inflicted but it reduces\nthe recovery time when a comet hits.\n\n2.      \nAfter playing the game once, I realised that\ninsurance must be re-purchased at the start of each level while protection can\nbe accumulated across levels. Therefore, it is highly favourable to ensure protection\nis built during every level and to have it accumulate to an adequate point to\nmeet the average severity of the comets at that level.      From\nthe example above, I gained one key learning that there is need to build a\nstrong foundation for risk\nmanagement with the view to continually build upon the existing infrastructure for further protection\nand security. Another\nkey learning is to be realistic and accept the fact that I cannot pursue everything simultaneously. I need to ensure\nthere is adequate protection for my ‘pods’ but not at the expense of not meeting my\ndevelopmental goals. Thus, my risk management plan needs comprise of all three components of research\n(knowledge), protection and insurance at varying\nlevels to help cope with the threats and damage of the comets.Lastly,\nI also learnt the importance of maintaining a reserve in view of an impending\nshock. Despite having insurance\nand protection, there is still a strong need to have resources after the shock to ensure recovery time is at\nits minimum so that development can resume quickly as before.\n\n3.      \nTwo suggestions to the game which might made the\nchoices more realistic:a.      \nWith increased research, make protection\ncheaper. One cost of protection which might or might not have been taken into\naccount is the cost of convincing people for the need of the protection. The\nreason for this cost is covered in the lecture videos relating to behavioural biasness\nof communities and people. With more research, there would be more information\nand justification to the recommended protection or risk management initiatives.b.     \nUnderstanding the short term view of people in\ngeneral, the cost of protection should vary with the time from the last impact.\nAfter a string of ‘misses’ of comets, protection cost should increase as it\nwould be more difficult to convince people to dedicate resources to protection\ngiven that they are likely to have ‘forgotten’ about its negative effects.\nReversely, it should be cheaper to invest in protection when an impact has just occurred as people would require less convincing. ",

            "reflection": " Risk management in the game will never be\nperfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changes\nin the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions to\nbe made in dealing with the risks being faced.Risk analysis results and\nmanagement plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasons\nfor this:\n\n1.      to evaluate whether the previously\nselected security controls are still applicable and effective\n\n2.      to evaluate the possible risk level\nchanges in the business environment. For example, information risks are a good\nexample of rapidly changing business environment.\n\nRisk\nmanagement identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability of\noccurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identification\nability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, a\nknowledge risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffective\ncollaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffective\noperational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce the\nproductivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability,\nservice, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangible\nrisk management allows risk management to create immediate value from the\nidentification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity. Risk management\nalso faces difficulties in allocating resources. This is the idea of\nopportunity cost. Resources spent on risk management could have been spent on more\nprofitable activities. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (or\nmanpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.\n\n The game captures are an innovation of risk management.\nInnovation is an important topic in the study of economics, business,\ntechnology, sociology, and engineering. Colloquially, the word\n\"innovation\" is often used as synonymous with the output of the\nprocess. Since innovation is also considered a major driver of the economy, the\nfactors that lead to innovation are also considered to be critical to policy\nmakers.\nIn the organizational context, innovation may be linked to performance and\ngrowth through improvements in efficiency, productivity, quality, competitive\npositioning, market share, etc. All organizations can innovate, including for\nexample hospitals, universities, and local governments.\nWhile innovation typically adds value, innovation may also have a negative or\ndestructive effect as new developments clear away or change old organizational\nforms and practices. Organizations that do not innovate effectively may be\ndestroyed by those that do. Hence innovation typically involves risk. A key\nchallenge in innovation is maintaining a balance between process and product\ninnovations where process innovations tend to involve a business model which\nmay develop shareholder satisfaction through improved efficiencies while\nproduct innovations develop customer support however at the risk of costly\nRD that can erode shareholder return.\n\"Innovation, like many business functions, is a management process that\nrequires specific tools, rules, and discipline.\"\nThe Innovation Equation she developed is:\nInnovation = Creativity * Risk Taking\nUsing this inventory it is possible to plot on axis where individuals fit on\ntheir Risk Taking and Creativity.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Hello all,The role of risk management is clearly defined in the game as it deals with the development of the community \"Alora\", taken into consideration some risks that is assigned with the comet attacks and some trade offs which are there in the form of protection, insurance and knowledge. Trade offs are there because of the limited resource MONEY, that automatically increases with its own pace. So while playing the game you need to keep in mind the basic idea of how risk management should be conducted?. that is Preparation and Coping. While preparing you need to carefully and critically analyse the situation as to where to allocate the money and what should be the quantity that needs to be allocated across different options. Also you need to keep in mind the basic goals of risk management that is to be resilient and to achieve prosperity. One of the most important observation in the game is the development bar. It is quite interesting  that the development bar only fills up when the player is trying to develop the community \"Alora\" and is not stick to the resilient concept. So it clears out the two basic objectives of risk management. When I first played the game I was trying to build the whole community at once and thus was failing in allocating much required amount in insurance, protection and knowledge. Then In the next try I tried the systematic approach of going step by step and did every action in line with another, as a result development bar started climbing up, a relaxing moment after a long time trying. Every level seemed easy then, a nice way of learning. The crux of risk management were clearly depicted in the game. I am a student in University of Delhi doing Economics H so i will design a game involving risk of the students and their trade offs. In my game the LIMITED RESOURCE money will be replaced by Time, the trade offs will be Studies, Friends, Activities. The COMETS will be the Exams or may be results of activities. And the ultimate goal as it was the development of the community of \"Alora\" in the game it will be the overall development of a student so that he or she gets a good placement at last. So the students will need to judiciously allocate limited time to various activities so that the Placement bar fills up and let them win in the game as well as in the life too. In that way the game will carry a decent message too.",

            "reflection": "The role of the risk management game showing how leveraging the strategy of development against risk helps us reduce adversary impact when odds occur and take advantage of the opportunity it present. The trade off is between whether the severity of the lost is acceptable or not , and whether protection or insurance is the best options depends on the likelihood of the disasters. in this game, knowledge helps to predict the likelihood of risk, which helps us make the appropriate inform decision. Preparation for risk also consider timing as well. Where the likelihood and severity of the disaster are small , it's would be waste to use available cash to carry out insurance or build protection early where it could depreciate over time. I have played the game more than one times. After each time, I learnt the key of successful development lie in timing of the decision . It also helps me have the better understand of the scale of severity and likelihood of the game , there for make more informed decision accordingly. The game itself is very well thought out and definitely helps me appreciate the theories I learnt in risk lecture more. If I would change anything to the game, I would make research and development to be incremental rather that restart from zero each time. As in real life, once technology innovation occur, it doesn't go backwards. In development, once the techniques, and know how is known, it couldn't only get better, and in very exceptional rare circumstances where the innovation is completely destroyed and need to restart from scratch.

The insurance helped in offsetting the damage done by the cometPlaying the game once, i failed on the first level as i didn't quite grasp the game immediately even after going through the tutorial but as i played it again, i had a better understanding and saw where i failed in the game. Managing risk effecting by identifying the risk within my environment (comet),researching the comet, putting the risk mitigation resources (insurance and raising my village in accordance with the level of the comet) and also monitoring the speed of the comets.I found out that even though i was well covered and when a comet stroke my village was not damaged but I still managed to fail and I couldn't quite understand why and how that happened. I would make it clearer for the user by giving hints to help them better protect their village as it wasn't very clear to me.

            "reflection": "1. I think that the risk horizon game gives us a good idea of how we can balance all the activities or stages involved in risk management.  First of all, it makes clear that everything grows around development or a wealth development activity.  That's what we should focus on.  Risk management only provides a framework to to make wealth creation possible and, to some extent, inmune to shocks or unexpected events.  So everything imoves around the creation of wealth.  Now the first thing we should do in the game is to seek knowledge about the dangers to our wealth creation activity.  In this case meteors.  Then we have to asses the probability of a shock happening at any given moment based in the knowledge we have previously gathered.  This will drive our spending in rsik management.  For the most part is better to prepare for a shock by buying insurance that will cover a relatively low part of the whole value.  That will leave enough resources to pay for protection of the village  moving the level of the village a little higher.  If the protection against shocks is good enough we will only have to spend a small amount in insurance, that is take an accessible plan that will only cover about a third of the total valuation of the village.   The key is to create a good dynamic in which we asses the probability of a shock by keeping a close eye in the environment.  Then we act on the information we gathered.  Now we have information that will tells us how much we should spend on risk management.  For small shocks we only need to spend a little.  For big shocks we have to spend a lot more.  We don't know when we are going to have small or big shocks but we do know that small shocks happen a lot more frequently than big shocks.  If we start spending small amounts on protection very frequently, in time we can build a very robust infrastructure to protect ourselves from shocks while leaving enough money ti spend on wealth building projects or activities.  2. The first time I played the game I was a little clumsy.  I didn't know exactly how it worked but it served as a learning experience.  The second time I completely focused on developing the village as a priority and in preserving it by checking up the sky for threats, buying low insurance and spending a considerable amount moving the ground level until it was safe for shocks in the near future.3. I think the game is fine, unless you want to add a set of different risks instead of just one.  For example, financial risk on wealth creating activities.       ",

            "reflection": "1. What was the role of risk\nmanagement in the game?\nRisk management was vital to the success of the game. Only through the\ndeployment of adequate protections, research and insurance was it possible to\nactually progress. The reason for this is without protection and insurance, it\nsimply wasn't possible to recover from shocks. However, by employing protection\nand insurance, it was both much easier to recover from shocks (and in some\ncases, there was no shock) whilst also investing in improving the infrastructure\nof the village for increased prosperity. \n2. What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of\nknowledge, protection, and insurance?\nAt first, it was a vital trade off to build small enough so that there was\nenough income, but also so that there was enough money left over to purchase\nprotection and the highest level of insurance. The trade-off here is that the\ngrowth of the village was much slower because investment wasn't as forthcoming.\nHowever, it meant, with proper protection and insurance in place, that long\nterm growth was both possible and sustainable. \n3. In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or\nafter some time)?\nThe immediate benefit of insurance was that inevitable repair costs were much\nlower which meant recovery was much quicker. The long term investment in\nprotection paid off, because as the comets got more severe, their impact\nactually diminished because the higher level of protection afforded tremendous resilience\nto the village. \n4. What did you do differently the second time you played the game?\nWhen I first played, I tried to grow infrastructure too quick without adequate\nprotection. This led to disaster. The second time round meant much greater\ninvestment in protections, research and insurance. Although this meant there\nwas a much slower growth in terms of upgrading the village and its buildings,\nit was sustainable and this allowed me to progress to level 5 in the game. \n5. What were the main things you learned from the game?\nSlow growth is still growth and adequate protection to mitigate or eliminate\nthe shocks from risk are essential for development and progression.\n6. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management\nchoices that matter in the place you live?\nFlooding is a problem near where I live. If I were to add to the game, I'd want\nto introduce more diverse protection options and upgrades. Raising the village\nis a great concept, but does not translate well to the real world as it isn't\ngoing to be very easy to physically raise a village. But perhaps provide other\npurchasable options. Some examples:\n\n\"Walls\" may be\n     cheaper, but offer less protection. \"Early warning\n     systems\" could be a low-cost investment which increases the rate of\n     research in the village. \"Upgrade defence\"\n     of individual buildings to withstand the impact of the shocks and thus\n     facilitate easier repair. It could be an expensive upgrade, but worth the\n     investment due to much-reduced repair costs. \nThese added protection options would allow the player to introduce more\ncost-benefit analysis of various solutions, make different trade-offs and add\ngreater depth to the game's risk management lessons.",

Risk\nmanagement is also about achieving prosperity, from improving the benefits from\npursuing opportunity. \n\nIn the game , the risk management   plays an important role to mitigate and sometimes\nto prevent the  probable damages to  pods occurring due to the falling meteors,\nthus allowing the erection and upgrading the pods.   Using, \nprotection, insurance and research, the game represents a good simulation\nof  how the risk management can help\ndevelopment by building resilience and  achieving\nprosperity by pursuing opportunities.  \n\nAs in the real time cases, obtaining knowledge on the\nfalling meteors  is not straight forward,\nand hence the making  the correct  choices for protection and insurance within\nthe given budget is fairly difficult.  \nIn the higher levels of the game this more so,  taking decisions on the trade offs  between the research, protection and building\nat the same time is extremely difficult.  This is mainly due to lack of knowledge on the\nrelationships among them to find the best combination.\n\nAfter the first attempt, I tried to balance my protection,\ninsurance and research in a way that could mitigate the impacts of the damages.\nMain thing that  I learnt from the game\nis that gathering knowledge is the most important aspect in the risk management.   The success of  engaging adequate protection, insurance and\ncommunity and institutional support depends mainly on the knowledge levels gained\non the probability of the incidence of risks and the severity of their impacts.\n\n\nFor a new version of the game, I wish to add a  warning system to give the community a better\nknowledge on the severity of what they can expect, so that they can make more\ninformed choices and trade -offs in terms of  different elements protection, insurance\nresearch etc.  ",

            "reflection": "1The role of Risk Management: In this case, we can speake of a Systemic Risk. Research (knowledge), Government money and community involvement are  highly important in management of this type of risk, to reduce uncertainty and build resilience in the best possible option.The game was about building pods  and community, research on obstacles/comets/shocks and protection by technology and insurance; sharing damage and getting insights, earning money by growing the community/wealth to be able to pay and share damage and take risks with others and overcome obstacles and build resilience. The effect of Risk Management:Combining capacity to perpare for obstacles in advance, with an ability to cope afterwards.The protection in the game seems to start by enhancing the community. That is one way, you can help each other, build knowledge, strength, earn money. And this is clearly pointing out, what we have learned from this course: People willing to take risks, you have to take risks in order to find opportunities. In this game, it seems to me that making a community, Then getting money from research, then protecting by lifting, and then insurance where the best ways to chose for.It seemed that only the highest level affected the cometrisk, having enough protection.The principles for Risk Management:Be realistic and build foundations.In this game, I saw that there was a focus on lifting the Island, based on research.And I saw that damage up to a certain level was accepted, and rebuilding of pods was postponed in order to do research and build protection.The balance between the choises was hard to reach as in many Risk Management Cases.The comets keep getting faster and faster and building and upgrading pods costs a lot of money, but they seem to be the only way out! Research helps to get money, which I said earlier I can only accept from Government money, cause otherwise, it would take money and time also. Building protection seemd to cost little then building pods, which seems strange to me. 2What I would do differently:I have tried the game over and over again and what I learned was this:I found it difficult to balance between the choises. Lack of resource where Money and time.  I run out of money all the time and there was little time to spend. So in short the best option seems to me:Build pods, do research, get protection. I wouldn't go to fast on insurance, that's what I did all the time, or spend too much on it. This is probably due to my Western thinking. I learned that a bit damage to pods could be accepted, that community is very important and that research is also important. Then build and then as fast as you can, get protection (lift the island). I learned, once you get growing, you can keep doing better, when risk and oppurtunity is well managed and balanced.3Developments to the game:I would like to see that research also costs money: Strangely enough in this game, you get money quickly when doing research. Research costs a lot of money; it pays back on longterm Yes and in short time when taken simple protection. so I think, it was government money, which is applaudible, being it a Systemic Risk.I would like to add:- metres to better see influence/costs of research, protection and development- a free option, for example: spend money on a shelter for everyone, gifts from abroad/ngo/ climate/waterissues, or other issues what may occur to the community, markets, education, communication, loans and savings etc).",

            "reflection": "The role of the Risk Management in the game provide a methodology to identify and analyze the impact of loss to the world of fictional world Alora. It was a competition of time vs funds or resources. In the game i had to choose the best possible insurance along with developing and upgrading pods. The game was about to realize the importance of knowledge i.e each comet has different characteristics depending upon the damage it will do and it is not necessary that the comet will surely hit but still we need to get prepare as we never know whether it will impact us and how much it will impact. Protection was done according to different levels. Initially the protection was not hard due to few pods were supposed to be manage. but later in the game as we developed and upgraded more pods, protection of the pods were becoming difficult which suggest that in general that if a country is having more population the risk of damage also increase with it. In case of insurance there was 3 different terms of insurance in each level. In the start i was dependent on insurance more but as i proceed to through next level. rely on insurance decreases because i was more developed in later levels as compare to level 1 so i didn't need to bought expensive insurance terms because i was able to manage repair through my own funds.First when i played the game my whole focus was on development and upgrading pods not to manage the risk of comets. which caused me to loose the level 2 and hardly i was able to reach at level 3. Then i gave so much importance to risk management that i didn't gave any attention to development all my focus was stick to managing risk associate with comets which caused me failing at level 3 because of less development of pods as all cost were put through managing risk and buying insurance with 75% terms. Then in third try i took a balance of risk management and development. and in later stages i decreased the cost of insurance and focused on development equally which enable me to reach level 5. I learned the importance of the risk management, and i understood that by preparing for risk can reduce the damage and also you can mitigate the risk by taking insurance. Research helps in getting knowledge of the risk hence it can be reduced and eliminated.If i would be giving option to change one thing in game i would like to change the risk from comets to earthquake or floods or both. As these are the risk faced by most of the countries. The duration of the game should be increase with more option to be provided for managing risk. For example in the current game the only risk was comet and only way to manage it was through research and provide community connection and insurance to reduce the cost related to risk. I think multiple risk like earthquake and floods and dealing with risk by choosing the best option will give the idea and also test the risk managing skills. ",

It I successfully completed level five once, but the game crashed before I could complete level six, and I did not record my code at level five, so my official score was failing level five, which I did many times. I quickly learned that I needed to develop as quickly as posable, because the faster you develop the more resources you get. Insurance is not necessary in the early rounds, but is important in the later rounds since the damage seems to grow much faster than the revenues. Protection is very important, and it is best to invest in it early when you have more tolerance in the system. Later in the game resources are more stressed, so you are much better off if you already have a good base level of protection. I'm not sure that research was useful. It made me feel good to know how bad a threat could be, but I'm not sure that the knowledge improved my play.I think the game could be changed to allow you to make an investment in community infrastructure that would buy you more time to click on the links after the disaster. ",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon for me was one of those essentially simple but annoyingly addicted games I ended up playing for quite some time. As you play the game more, you realise that it is all about balance. Because of the different limitations (can't do anything while researching; no development while building protection; less capital if buying insurance) it is immediately obvious that one must trade-off each of these against each other. After my first attempts at trying to fill up the spaces with houses, I realised that I didn't need as many if I focused on developing the ones I had, which left more capital for protection etc. The key to the game it appears is striking this balance and using knowledge to boost limited protection. Although it may seem wise to get full insurance every level, if one invests more in developing early so better protection can be built, then more time can be spent on researching dangerous comets and thus more reaction time to build connections. This kind of tactic, if well executed, allows one to deal with the majority of comets to strike in the first few levels, and if enough protection is built up early on, almost all comets with minimal damage. Of course, the risk taken here is that without insurance you are open to game-ending damage, but what you notice towards the end of the game is that the insurance is usually not enough to prevent this from happening, as it takes too long to rebuild before the timer runs down. So, the best thing to do is pump money into early development and protection, take the risk on lower insurance rates and spend the rest of the time researching for that extra boost. In real terms, this would lead to the conclusion that overall, risk prevention and limitation are the most important components of risk management; one would prefer to minimise as much of the risk as is possible in a preventative capacity, rather than pick up the pieces after insufficient protections have been breached. Risk management where I live (London) initially may appear to be too unique to the individual concerned but in actuality there is basically just one risk; loss of income. The cost of living is so high, that for your average household, the loss of the main wage earner could begin a slide into poverty, very quickly indeed. Institutionalised risk management and education have reduced normal environmental risks to a distinctly rare and unlikely event for most people. This means that there is little personal investment in prevention. For example, the Thames Barrier prevents London being flooded on average 7 times a year, sometime three times that. This means that very few, if any, have ever thought it possible that London floods. If the Barrier fails, there are little to no contingency measures in place. Probably the best way to represent the risk management choices in London is allowing overdrafts with extortionate interest rates and allowing the insurance company to not pay out after a flood. ",

I\nscanned the sky for comets, while building better structures. I adjusted the\nisland lift as necessary to ensure resource growth. \n\nIn level 2 and 3, my first priority\nwas 75% loss insurance. This resulted in lower damage costs. I then proceeded\nto build better structures, keeping an eye out for comets. I researched comets\nmore and raised the island higher in these levels than in level 1.   \n\nMy trade-offs were in allocating\nresources towards protection and insurance early in the level, and having\nresource production and knowledge compensate for it by the end of the level. To\nensure smooth transition from one level to the next, all buildings had to be\ncompleted (or repaired) prior to ending a level. That allowed optimal money\ngeneration rate.  \n\nThe first time I played the game, I\nhad no clue on how to use research, and did not generate enough resources to\nprogress past level 1. I played the game numerous times and my above-stated\nstrategy reflected my optimal choices. \n\n I learned to allow for build and repair time, as that was an\ninconvenient variable in the game. Higher game levels produced more risk of\nloss, so crutches like insurance, comet research (community building) and\nraising the island were balanced with resource production to progress through\nthe game. \n\nIf I were tasked with developing a\nnew version of the game, I would reduce the build time (or make it the same\ntime for all structures), as it resulted in more losses than comet hits. The\nbuild time is a voluntary but necessary risk to progress through the game, and\nseemed to be more important than the involuntary risks from comet hits. If I\nwere to tailor the game to my current environment, I would let the lower levels\nlast 4 minutes, and make the higher levels last for progressively shorter\nperiods. If the strategy were not optimized by then, the player would lose.   \n\n",

            "reflection": "In this game, risk management means to prevent the pods being crushed by the stars. Usually it requires to increase the protection level to compete with the severity level of the stars. On the other hand, we need to keep an eye on the development of pods in order to get more money to increase the development level and complete the level goal. I usually make sure the protection level is beyond the severity of the stars, so that nothing will be damaged. It turns out that if the pods get damaged, it will cost a lot of money to repair, and the development level will drop dramatically, sometimes leads to a failure in the level. So I believe it is always a good choice to fulfill the protection level first. I usually don't buy the insurance, as my protection level is high enough to prevent any damage. However, I do experience some time that the severity is so high (such as full severity but I usually just keep the protection level for about 70%-80%) that I get a little bit damage, which always result in failing that level. I usually do not spend much money on research in the severity level of the stars, but just check it very quickly and make sure that my protection level is 20% higher than that.\nI have played several times on this game. At first I didn't get the rules quite well, and I always buy the highest level of insurance and see the pods crush and repair them. I did not raise the protection level at first. I can sometimes get to level 3, but I often end the game very quickly. Then I studied the rule a bit more, and decide to put more effort on the protection level and development of pods. Then I get to pass the level requirement very quickly, and get quite good at it. I shared my experience with my peers, and they all get good results using my strategy. xD",

Risk management involves planning and resiliance,\nand we do this with knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping.  3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariables\nand probability are big obstacles, so I would introduce more variables. For example, annual rainfall is largely unpredictable and can have a\nhuge range of secondary impacts over time. Where I live in California, there is\ncurrently a drought, and it influences our daily lives, from how we use it in\nour homes to the price of food. ",

            "reflection": "I couldn't get the game for the first time. Every preparation for risk except insurance worked after a while and indeed affect development in high extent. The higher level of development the longer time to recover somehow after shocks.Playing for the first time I tried to built the pods as fast as I could and as much as possibile, but it turned out that due to high risk of shock it wasn't the best strategy. Then I tried built few pods first, develop them enhanced them and if there were no much shocks around for some time I tried to built a few more. Meanwhile I invested some money for protection which of course slowed down development overall, however the damage after every shock was smaller.I had no infulence to comets itself I could only observe them and based on information and especially on 'chance of hit information I could adjust my development depend on risk whether is high or low but even this wasn't a good source to trust. After all it turned out that the most important was first eliminate the risk and mitigate it to the lowest level and then development speeds up. On the other hand I couldn't completely restrain the development the village had to thrive.In my place where I live the risk of natural distater is rather low, there are some other risks like financial crisis which affected us all in some extent. Nevertheless the biggest issue and obstacle to development is rooted somewhere deep the fear of failure and complexes. We are also not taught to insure ourselves or families or housholds. I would recommend to learn and teach how to become and be more resilient person itself. We have all needed and required resources to do so but education has gone in some different direction.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game provides a simplified model of the risk management process as explained in the course. The goal of the course is to realize for the community the opportunities available through the given resources (land, financial resources, etc...) in a context of environmental risks (meteors falling n the sea and creating natural disaster). To strive and succeed, it is necessary to balance well the different components of risk.First, the end goal is to build assets for the community, so a significant part of the available resources should go to do it. The goal is not to devote most resources to achieve 100% protection against risk, or to avoid risk altogether - but on the contrary to build a reasonable exposure to risksSecond, it is possible to gain information and knowledge regarding upcoming risks by buying surveys. that helps with assessing the level of protection and assurance required to reasonably mitigate the risksThird, once risks are evaluated, it is possible to mitigate risks by buying protection (by raising the level of the ground) and by buying insurance (reducing the financial loss in case the risk is realized)  Finally, if the risk is materialized, then it is possible to cope with it by buying repairsI played the game a couple of times. When I started first, I was using too many resources to buy the assets, and got stuck when I was caught with too little protection when a big meteor crushed. Second time, I was probably too prudent, and could not finish on time. Third time I got it right, by raising the level of protection only when my observations where showing a significant risk ahead, and by building the assets at the right rhythm - not too fast, not too slowly. I also has to accept some exposure to risk and accept that some of my assets be damaged. Maybe I was also lucky, I don't know...This game is indeed a simplified model to describe the reality of risk management. It might overlook the fact that in real life, people get more and more resilient and knowledgeable to risks as they are exposed to them. For example, some assets can be built more efficiently or some information management can be more efficient as people encounter those risks over and over again. So, one way to make the game more realistic would be to improve the efficiency of risk management choices, or maybe to make available new risk management tools as the player is becoming more experienced. that would allow the community to become more and more sophisticated, while coping more and more efficiently with risks. ",

            "reflection": "1. What\nwas the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what\ntrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?\nIn what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after\nsome time)?\n\nAns : Risk\nmanagement had a very important role, in the game as there was a tradeoff to be\nmade in terms of resources available and the avenues where they can be used. The\nthree main avenues were: protection, insurance, research. All three had their\nown benefits. I always tried to keep the Pods at a comparatively higher\nelevation giving them the protection. While research was my main tool, through\nwhich I could minimize the losses by community living to boost my protection. Insurance\nwas taken by me according to the levels of difficulty, as the level got\ntougher  I increased the insurance plan,\nthis helped to mitigate the losses in case of severe meteors. This preparation helped\nme to reduce the losses levels of impact to 0%, and sometimes 7-9 %. This was a\nremarkable achievement as now I could easily upgrade the Pods and thus induce\ndevelopment in the community.\n\n2.If\nyou played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to\nplay it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did\nyou do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned\nfrom the game?\n\nAns: I\nplayed the game more than once, and there was some improvement in every next\nattempt. These were as follows:\n\n· From the\nnext time, I started utilizing the community living structure well by\nresearching the meteors.\n\n· By keeping a\ntrack of all my investments, I could better decide which insurance policy to\nopt for according to the last experience of the number and quality of meteors.\n\n· The proper\nutilization of resources that is if we have enough monetary resources than time\nshould be well utilized as when we research for the meteors. \n\nLearnings:\n\n· When research\nis being carried out, if we have enough resources then go for upgrading or\ndeveloping a new Pod, and then continue researching.\n\n· Spend time\non researching only when we see that there is a big chance of hitting.\n\n· If there are\nmore than one meteors, decide according to the potential threat and speed of\ntheir movement and accordingly research all of the required ones.\n\n· If we manage\nthe risks well, there can be development in the longer run which can be then\nutilized for prosperity in living.\n\n\n\n3.The game captures, in a simplified\nway, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a\nnew version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing.\nWhat change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices\nthat matter in the place you live   \n\nAns: the\nchanges that I would like to make are as follows:\n\n·  Separate insurance\nfor the different geographical areas involved, this would include a decision\nparameter that which area to develop first and which area to insure, doing a better\ncost-benefit analysis.\n\n·  The return\non cost should be given, that in which version of POD how much are we getting\nin return, this would include a trade-off between upgrading the PODS and the\nrisk mitigation.\n\n. The\ndifferent meteors that were given should have a specific characteristic of the\nlosses possible. There should be clear instructions of the probable % losses\ndue to different meteors.       .  the PODs should be given with specification that which grade POD has how much resistance and earning potential, as there will be another trade off between developing new POD's and upgrading the old ones.                                                                                ",

            "reflection": "I played the game 3 times. During my first attempt, I\nchecked how game worked. On the second attempt, I started figuring out how my\ndecisions affected my progress and I reached level 3. On my 3rd\nattempt, I reached level 4 with some improved decisions and timing. During the\ngame, I realized the importance of decision-making in terms of knowledge,\nprotection-insurance and development. There was external risk for damage that\nshould be prevented and at the same time, the need for development. The more I\nplayed the game, the more I understood the timing and the decisions to be made\nin order to achieve the goal.\n\nThe balance between these\nchoices is difficult to reach. If you spend too much on\nbuilding and upgrading pods, you will be exposed to comets when they hit. When\nyou sustain damage from comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On\nthe other hand, if you spend too much on preparation for risk, you will not\nhave enough money to develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.\nThis is a balance policy makers have to\nconsider all the time.\nThey have limited resources, so there is a tension between spending up front on\nrisk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but may not hit) or to\nspend on other development priorities. How should they spend their money?\n\n The role of risk\nmanagement had to do with the development of the village and its protection,\nwith limited resources (funding). The preparation for risk management has\ncertain financial cost, but slowly it helped attain the same or even better\nfinancial condition. If I were playing the game again, I would possibly attempt\ndifferent timing and strategy on my decisions for research (knowledge),\ndevelopment and insurance, so that I increase the likelihood of advancing to\nthe next level.\n\nIf I could change one thing, it might be the possibility of\ndeveloping mechanisms to defend the possibility of damage from the comets in a\nlong term. In that way, there might be less need to short-term insurance.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The game is very\ninteresting and successful in consolidating the concept of risk\nmanagement. All events are presented in a simple way, but captured almost most\nof the major factors of risk. If I have a choice to improve the game by adding\na simple thing, I would add more options for the type of natural disasters so\nthat players can choose appropriate disaster for the place they live.  For example, flooding or typhoon would be best\nsuitable for the South East Asia areas while tornadoes would be a good choice\nfor the United States.  From each\nparticular type of selected disaster, the player will have a choice to see how\nthe consequences would be; the protection planning and insurance therefore\nvaried. In fact, the disaster type dictates how the frame work of risk\nmanagement should be although the end result are the same as destruction are unimaginable\nfinancially and economically in worst case scenarios. The current disaster type in the game doesn't represent an actual situation that most commonly occurred on earth; however,\nit has captured the overall process of understanding the risk environment to\nplan for protections.  In fact, there always\nare more than one type of natural disasters that qualify for the risk\nmanagement in every communities.  In my\narea, earth quake and firing are the disasters that we are looking at for the\nrisk management.  Through learning how\nthe shock happened in the past and what would happen in the future, we are\nmobilizing the whole community in planning for coping with the problem. The\ngame feature will then have this capacity, and perhaps becomes more interesting\nwhen the player has to deal with multiple threats that, in worst case scenario,\nwould happen at the same time. The player totally has his or her choice to\nestablish the situation complexity. The rewarding of course will be based on\nhow many and what type of disasters that the player are facing.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI hope my idea is\nsimple enough for the change in the game. \nI do enjoy playing it, and this is the best practice in reinforcing the\nlesson we are learning.  It is the first\ntime I see how a computer game benefits an academic lesson.  I hope, in the future, we will see in\nacademic environment, more fun activities are available for learning and\nstudying.  Be creative and we will make\nour way! ",

            "reflection": "To be honest with you I was skeptical about the game when I\nfirst saw it. However after I played it, I changed my mind. The game, in spite\nof being so simple, provided me with a lot of insights about risk management. It shows the importance of all parts of risk management: knowledge, protection and insurance. Here are some of insights that I found very interesting.\n\nFirst of all, when I was playing the game, I\nwas researching comets. It helped me to predict the severity and the chance of\nhit, so I was able to build up necessary protection and decide on timing of my\nexpenditures. This demonstrates the importance of getting knowledge in order to\ncope with risk more affectively. Since the time and money were limited, during\nthe game as in reality one have to make decisions on how to use available\nresources in the most effective way. Thus, I had to decide whether I want to build\nor upgrade a pod in order to develop my settlement or to increase protection or\nto buy insurance. These kinds of choices are very similar to what many\nindividuals, societies and governments are facing every day. \n\nSecond, the game demonstrates the importance of building up\nprotection. Even though you could not see the benefits of money that you have\nspend if there is no damage after the disaster (comet stroke). However, if the\nlevel of protection is low and not sufficient, the losses are much greater and\nit becomes difficult to achieve the required level of development in time. In\naddition, the connections between different pods helped to increase protection,\nthus the higher integration of society is beneficial.\n\nThird, I would like to talk about the insurance. When I was\nplaying the game for the first time I was purchasing insurance every round.\nFinally my reserves were depleted and I was not able to reach the required\nlevel of development in tame because of the lack of money. The second time when\nI played the game, I didn’t purchase insurance during the early stages of the\ngame. Instead I invested money in building up the protection. However, later in\nthe game the insurance is absolutely necessary, because once you got hit, the\nrenovation is very costly and there is almost no chance to “come back” on track\nin time.\n\nIf I can add one thing to the game it would be different types\nof buildings/different industries with different exposure to the risk, but also\ndifferent returns. So the choices of prioritization should be made.\n\nThank You!",

            "reflection": "The game provided a simplified but nevertheless realistic version of real obstacles that might impede the development progress, giving an authentic overview of events that disrupt original plans and projects.I unfortunately did not reach higher than level four, and, without completing it, as I endeavoured to find a balance between knowledge, protection and development. I did, however, find that knowledge and research were the most beneficial aspects to place extra focus on. I spent an hour at two separate occasions, playing the game, struggling originally with the instructions, but soon harmonised the relationship between developing and researching, in favour to focusing excessively on protection and insurance. This way I learnt the importance of continuing “normal life” despite external threats as they cannot be managed or contained but simply prepared for. I also found that the further up in the levels one went, the more the comets missed due to the preparation having been conducted in the earlier ones.I understand that protection was an impediment in itself, as it withdrew valuable time that could have been spent doing research and developing, however, I think that it is something that should be incorporated into the development plan of action, rather than considered a separate element in the field of risk management. Insurance, as a strategy, usually did not come in very handy in the game if enough rigorous protection was in place. It was commonly an expense that did not provide a profitable enough return and thus came out less useful. Insurance only marginally decreased the cost of rebuilding and re-capacitating the community. Furthermore as a long term benefit insurance was barely relevant in the situation, as the cost tended to outweigh the benefits.  I would, as an improvement to the game in general, but mainly for the morale of the player, suggest checkpoints which allows the player to restart on the same level on which they failed. After having failed four levels on numerous occasions, I found it rather demoralising having to recommence at the first level each time. Furthermore, based on my location, which is currently a commute between Scandinavia and the British Isles, I for example think that community connections become less relevant, as Northern Europe in general has quite individualistic cultural norms. Instead, I might even be so bold to suggest an eradication of that component of the game in order to regionalise it, thus making it even difficult for the community to cope with the shocks.I learned primarily that balance is key, both in development in general and in risk preparation strategy. One of the most interesting aspects of the game, and how to rebuild a community, was how linking the citizenry with each other has such a powerful effect, which one might struggle to visualise if not having experienced any shocks that have affected one’s community in a similar way.  As a recent graduate from international development studies, I have not until commencing this course fully realised the significance of risk management within this field, and, it was given a substantially small amount of attention during my course. There is a need for fostering solid infrastructure between these elements within the realm of development as well as e.g. security and conflict resolution, to reduce both societal and personal adverse shocks in all three areas. Further education on these issues are essential, for preparing and providing individuals and households with the adequate tools in order to cope with adverse shocks. I will suggest for my university to implement this game into the course plans of one or several of the modules. ",

            "reflection": "1. Risk management in the game demonstrated that in life their are trade offs to decision making. Resources are finite and therefore you need to way the pros and cons for selecting certain strategies over others. In order of importance the game seemed to reinforce that knowledge is the most important, then protection and finally insurance. However importantly all are required to cover various levels of shock. For example, knowledge is demonstrated by identifying which comets are likely to hit. You can safely ignore those that are not going to and you need to focus on those that are. Knowledge allows you to understand the level of protection required to adequately meet the shock. In this game this was the level of the village raised as protection. It is a waste of resources and time to raise protection so high that the community cannot develop. Protection of a few does not help you progress. Finally insurance provided you a means of quickly recovering from a shock. The game highlighted that insurance is not necessarily immediately however it is required once you have reached a certain level of development. 2. After playing the game numerous times it became apparent that building more pods and increasing their level increased the overall score. A parallel to life can be drawn with the importance of investing in developing infrastructure, buildings etc. Insurance became important when you had more to lose. With only a few buildings the cost benefit ratio was not there for insurance. Importantly the more i played the game the more I understood that initial research of which comets (shocks) would likely eventuate. Those that would not could be ignored whereas those that were going to hit had to be addressed. This could be through protection - raising the level of the village, insurance if protection would not cover the shock or continued research. 3. I was not really sure what the connections represented. However the more research that was conducted the more time i had to make connections. I assume that this parallels to the community helping each other in time of shock. As highlighted in the weekly resources and also the Risk Report investing in the right technologies for a given area is vital. This is dykes in Neatherlands, drainage (required) in Mumbai and building codes in Chile. It may be a good addition to add this component to the game. That is certain structures are better built in a certain area. This would required knowledge. If they are built in the correct area the protection level is higher. Therefore you need less insurance. Vice versa if you build them in incorrect areas their protection level is lower and insurance is higher.",

            "reflection": "If it start\nwith the definition of risk management; as the process of confronting risk,\npreparing for them, and coping with their effects; the role of the risk\nmanagement in the game show the importance to confronting risk, when you do not\nknow that these comes; so do the relevance of research and at the same time\nthat this allows to preparing as better as possible to confronting the risk.\nThe game shows that coping with the effects of the risk are better when you decide\ninvest in insurance and make alliances with the town.\n\nThe first\ntime that I play the game it was hard because I could not understand the\nimportance of the research and the alliances with the community; so the next\ntime that I play the game I did pay attention to the option of the insurance,\nthen to the importance of the communication with the village, and finally I\nunderstood that the research is important but is more important take this\ninformation and make the decision in the right moment, because if you decided\nthat protection is needed in the village when is late, the money that you\ninvest in it is money waste. So that, the resources invest in research will be\nuseful is take the information and take measures of control in order to\npreparing for the risk before of it occurs.\n\nNow summarize\nmy experience with the game is that the preparing for the risk affect in a\npositive way because I could survive the second time that I played, because, I\ninsist, I did the research, I bought an insurance versus damage, I established communications\nwith the village and also I bought protection, so the result was that I\nsurvived more levels. And this is a really good analogy with the life, if you\ninvest in protection for the event even if you are not sure that occurs, you\nmight be quiet when contingency happens.\n\nFor the\nlast, for my community it would be interesting introduce changes in order to\nmanagement the risk with the flood and landslides from hills, principally,\nbecause we have others problems like the traffic every day because the streets\nare not well planned and the different manifestations of various groups.\n\nBut, back\nto the flood, I think that is really necessary that the people aware about the\nimportance because of the benefits of insurance versus risk of this kind. And\nlike long term plan the alliance with the government so that improve the sewer\nsystem with infrastructure quality.\n\n",

            "reflection": "In\nessence, the Risk Horizon game nicely highlights the challenges related to the\nallocation of limited resources. Any of the three ‘tools’—knowledge/research,\nprotection, and insurance—costs money in its application and goes at the\nexpense of another one. The attempt to protect yourself against the drawbacks\nof a hit by matching the severity (protection) makes you lose valuable time for\ndeveloping the settlement. I began noticing the ramifications of not focusing\non developing the settlement to a sufficient degree only at a later stage\n(levels 3 and 4) because the more sophisticated research stations take longer\ntime to build. In addition, the development of the settlement is very important\nfor properly predicting the severity and probability of the hit. I had to\nexperience a few times that I thought I was prepared but then got caught by\nsurprise because the prediction was unreliable. Clearly, this shows that all of\nthose three tools and strategies are intertwined and need to be pursued in a\nholistic approach. \n\nI\nplayed the game more than once since I admittedly did not manage to get to\nlevel 4 in my first attempts. I somewhat relied less on insuring the settlement\nin my latter—successful—attempts because I felt it was possible to develop the\nsettlement more quickly by protecting it rather than rebuilding it at a cheaper\nrate. But obviously this was only my personal approach. However, at times it is\ninevitable to use the insurance, in particular when the level of protection\ncouldn’t match the severity of the hit. In these cases I tried to buy the\ninsurance shorty before the hit. I realised that it is extremely important to\nremain flexible with regard to the application of the tools and seize the\nopportunities in the respective situations. Furthermore, it became quite\nobvious that one cannot neglect any of the three tools highlighting the\nimportance of an integrated approach to risk management. \n\n I\nthink an interesting change or addition to the game would be to incorporate\nother stakeholders, such as other households or banks that can form a community\nand share the burden of managing risk. Since in real life your choices often\ndepend on the choices of other—or are taken jointly—this might bring the game\nyet another step closer to the reality of managing risk. Hence I believe that\nthis change would better represent the risk management choices that matter in\nthe place where I (and arguably all of us) live: a global community. ",

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk is to protect Alora and his habitants, with risk we avoid the damage of the comets and the waves. For knowledge I only spend time but It was worthy because by just looking the comets I could see information about the comet and made the inhabitants of Alora made part of this knowledge.For protection I spend a lot of resources in elevating the Alora's base but It was the most worthy thing because almost all the comets that fall down in the planet make not damage because of the protection that I had bought. I bought the insurance from the third level, the best insurance that saved me of big damages of the high severity comets. The risk was crucial for development, It allows me to have development and at the same time be protected of the comets.2. I played it more that once, I think that along the games what I were learning was to balance how much to spend in development and how much in risk. A really important balance to reach the requirements of each level. I learned that risk worth the cost, also that knowing how to managed risk is difficult but that with every experience about risk I do it better, learn from failures is really important. Finally, also that the balance is something to really take care.3. Multitasking is really important for risk management it would be really important for managing risk to us to be allowed to make at the same time various actions risking the same resources.",

            "reflection": "For me personally the Risk Horizon game wasn't the best way of learning more about the interlinked components of Risk Management. I've played the game more than once, but it seemed like as more I've played the worse it got. Furthermore, I think people who are used to computer games will do much better because their speed and ability to move the cursor. If people, like myself are more slow with the fingers, especially for the last part where you try to rebuild your pots and as more points you retrieve,as better, because you are not damaged. I also did not really find out how to share resources after I've got hit. This said, I have learned during the game, that as more research you do as more protected the village is. Protection allows me to reduce the risk and the size of losses. Research is a very important part of preparation. It allows me to gain knowledge and be aware of what is to come, I am preparing myself and the community: working together to building houses stronger etc.  The community can survive by sharing resources through knowledge. It is a very important  task to help people understand that they have resources and do help them identify these resources. Finding these lacks of resources are very important. In underdeveloped nations it is mostly the lack of finances and a lack of access to markets. Forming and sustaining connections with each other and different organisations is very valuable. Building networks can help prevent the outcome of the next damage. Different societies need to work together. Everybody can contribute and strengthen their community.Insurance plays a huge part. I have already mentioned, that a very big problem is the lack of finances. So for Organizations to offer the chance of Insurance is a great opportunity to overcome these obstacles. Organisations can help provide security and help people to prepare before disaster strikes. For a new version of the game I would definitely make it more clear how everything works more together. After I won it shows the meteors when we click on them, we can learn about them. How does that affect the game though? How does it help me though to prepare myself and the community I live in. The main thing I have learned is to really know my community, to enable people to work with everybody together to build a stronger network.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game emphasizes that we are exposed to\nrisk, as we have no control over the trajectory of the comets, but the ability\nto manage our risk can improve the development of our little lunar community. The\ngame highlights that building foundations is important, as it is not just about\navoiding commits.  The role of the risk\nmanagement game was to gain a better understanding of the importance of\nbalancing and investing in research (knowledge), protection, insurance, and\ncoping as a community.The game had you making choices between how you develop your\ncommunity and how you manage risks. There was a choice of increasing\nresearching which contributes to knowledge, a choice to protect by increasing\nelevation, and a choice to purchase insurance. The trades offs were between how\nto spend your time and resources.  While the\namount of money would change, the time we are allocated does not so if you were\nspending time on protection, you were not able to spend time on research so it\nwas important to be aware of when to shift your priorities.I played the game several times and found that as I played,\nI became better at using research and matching protection. After several times,\nyou also realize that there should be something happening at all times. If you\nare not developing or seeking protection, you should be researching to help minimize\ndamage.  The main thing that I learned is\nthat there is finite time, so it is important to make choices as to how you\nwant to spend such time. Also, research has a large impact, so the importance\nof knowledge is key. Knowing the severity of the comet and the likelihood allowed\nme to compensate by purchasing insurance or building protection.  It is interesting to note that  just having complicated policies or expensive\ninsurance packages in place is not enough, it is essential to have knowledge\nwith protection and insurance.The game is very interesting as it creates a need for\nbalance. When you were able to prepare for the risk, such as through using\nresearching, you were able to connect with your developments and minimize the\ndamage, if it occurred as we learned that sometimes the comet passes by. You cannot\navoid risks and impacts but you can reduce the damage they would have on your\ncommunity. The development meter also reminds us that having responsibility is\nnot limited to just avoiding or preparing for risky situations but it is also\nimportant to develop your communities and build foundations. If we spent all\nour time avoiding risks, then the community would not grow and the development\nmeter would not fill.If I were to make an addition to the game, I would add an\nelement that allows for opportunity, such as being able to spend resources on\ninnovation, which could improve the development of the community or could use\nup resources and not yield intended results. This would help add the element\nthat managing risk can also allow for opportunities. ",

The game showed that the difficulty in making decisions that balance between these factors and also the severity and likelihood of the risk eventuating. The first time I over-purchased insurance and protection, so in future attempts I took on more risk in order to grow more pods. If I could make the game more life-like, you could differentiate between systemic risks and individual risks to each pod, as though each pod represented an individual. Or you could make it a town, where there were several types of risks - disease, fire, unemployment, crime, drought etc and complicate the insurance and protection measures to be taken for each risk. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game associates with coordinating the resource distribution between development (building and upgrading pods) and risk prevention (leveling up the base/insurance). The knowledge is not necessarily represented well in this game, given that the knowledge is always 1 or 0. I have to choose between protection and insurance because clearly having both protection and insurance will impede development severely. More specifically, insurance has a large upfront cost and gets more and more expensive with either increased game level or more upgraded pods (I cannot say for sure which is the cause). The insurance cost won't be too much of a problem for lower levels because the development is relatively easy speed up. However, for higher levels, the large upfront cost for insurance takes too much resources and impedes development significantly, especially higher level pods take longer to develop and therefore the cost in time is more pronounced. Additionally, although insurance covers a percentage of damage, it still needs time for repair and in the meantime, the development is slowed down.  Protection (leveling up the base) does not have upfront cost and can be adjusted to cope with the potential damage from the meteor. Although the aggregate cost for protection is higher that insurance, the protection can be used multiple times before it decreases significantly. Moreover, protection does not incur the damage repair process and won't affect the established development.My first strategy was to prioritize risk prevention. For any new appearing meteor, I would assess its potential damage and raise up the base to match the potential damage. In this way, I had enough time to cope with the meteor struck and basically had no damage from any struck. However, I had difficulty passing Level 3 using this strategy because I heavily invested in risk prevention so that the development speed does not meet the criteria. Then, I changed my strategy slightly and use insurance to cover the damage at lower levels, since the upfront cost at lower levels was acceptable, also the repair time for lower levels was short. At Level 2 and 3, I used my old strategy and deal with the risk with prevention. As I mentioned above, the knowledge function in this game was not clear. It seems like the knowledge of a meteor will change slightly during its trajectory. However, it would make more sense if over the whole period of time, the knowledge of the meteor increase and the potential damage and change of hit can be estimated more precisely. This would be closer to the reality that people learn to cope with a particular kind of risk more effecitively.   ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game Risk Horizon was\nto protect the community from the risk of comet shocks, which could result in\ndamage to infrastructure. Managing the\nrisk of comets through the use of research, insurance and protection allowed\nthe community to take informed action to protect infrastructure and hasten\nrecovery. \n\nHowever risk-management measures use\nresources, such as time and money that could otherwise be used for development.\n Therefore risk preparation can slow\ndevelopment initially. However it increases development in the long term by\nmaking communities more resilient and hastening recovery. Trade-offs have to be\nmade between risk management and development. By gaining research on the severity\nand probability of comet shocks a community can match the necessary level of\nprotection and/or insurance to the probability of risk.\n\nOn my first attempt at Risk Horizon, I\nspent my resources on development and insurance. On my second attempt I better\nprepared myself for risk by carrying out more research and investing in\nprotection rather than insurance. This allowed me to match protection with the\nseverity of the comet shocks. Protection slowed development initially but it had\nincreased investment return in the long-term, as protection carried into the\nnext levels of the game.\n\nRisk Horizon illustrates the principles of\nrisk management, reflecting the real world obstacles to risk management such as\nknowledge, financing and behaviour biases. It demonstrates the importance of\ncollecting data about risk to make informed decisions and exemplifies the\nchallenges financing can play on risk management. Risk Horizon demonstrates\nthat even small investments in risk management will greatly increase\ndevelopment in the long term, and demonstrates the necessity of investing in\nrisk management even when finances are minimal. \nRisk Horizon also demonstrates behavioral biases, such as how easy it\ncan be to underestimate risks. This illustrates the importance of Governments\nproviding well-researched and planned risk management as well as providing incentives\nand education to the public about the benefits of individual risk management.\n\n Risk Horizon illustrates elements of risk\nmanagement however in the real world communities often face risks from more\nthan one source.  To better reflect the\nchallenges of risk management a new version of Risk Horizon could include risks\nfrom multiple sources. For example including a health risk such as a pandemic.\nMeasures would have to be taken to protect against comets whilst also investing\nin public health services to protect against pandemics. This would reflect the\nreal world challenges faced from spreading communities limited resources across\nmultiple sectors. ",

            "reflection": "The role risk management was to manage the development of a community and to prepare this community to confront risks. In the game we learnt in a practical way how important is:-manage resources: mainly in terms of economic resources and time investment. Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages. -manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks. -invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis. -the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles. The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risksThe game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones.     In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, \" Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity\". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community. ",

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game? The role of risk management in the game was to teach how to use assets such as knowledge, insurance and protection to build a healthy development. What choices did you make? I used all the assets that were available. I did some research to learn about the strength of the comets when they strike; I protected the development against the comets, and most importantly I insured the development against the disaster the comets could cause. What trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection,  and insurance? In term of trade-offs, I noticed that I  had to make a hard choice between upgrading the development and spending money on assets such as insurance, research and protection. I finally had to spent a lot of money not only to have a better insurance, but also to make sure that I had a better protection against the comets. I ended up not upgrading the development because I had invested almost all the money on insurance and protection of the development that I had acquired already.  In what ways did preparation for risk affect development  (immediately, or after some time)? Preparation affected development in a way that I knew ahead which comets could really destroy the development, and I also knew what could be the impact of each comet on the development. Knowing all that helped me select my insurance premium, and it also helped me focus more on investing on the development instead of spending the money on protection. If you played the game more than  once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the  main things you learned from the game? When I played the game for the first time, I did not do any research at all. I wasn't then able to be well-prepared to face the impact of the implosion of the comets. For that reason, I misused my funds on buying a high insurance premium to protect the development against an imagery hit. When I noticed that I could study the comets and understand their strength and the probability of their destructive impact, I mainly focused on the research during the following games. The main thing I learned from the game is that one should always know his environment by doing some research, and once he knows his environment, he should make sure to take appropriate measure to protect his asset against eventual harm. The most important thing I learn is that insurance should always be part of our daily activity because it will help lower the cost of repair, and in some case the insurance may even pick up all the repair.  What change would you  propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in  the place you live?   In this scenario, I will first of all show the consequences of unpreparedness, the consequences of the lack of insurance. Once I depict that, I will then educate people on the importance of insurance. Most importantly, I will ask people to invest a lot in research so that they understand what actions they should take in order to reduce the chances of lost in their activities.   ",

While developing the community is the main goal, protecting the pods from the devastating effects of the meteors is essential. Both of these two tasks cost money, time, and attention for the\nplayer. The player should make calculated moves in terms of building new pod and/\nor developing the existing ones. Keeping the wealth for emergency spending,\ni.e. repairing comes at the price of missing your developmental goal. Also,\neven though spending time on watching the celestial bodies is essential for the\nrecovery, it keeps you away from developing the village. This is also true\nabout raising the land level. The cost for the research and raising the land\nlevel were negligible and both activities seemed to be very helpful. However,\nthe main drawback is devoting your attention fully to these tasks, keeps you\naway from taking the game to the next stage. The other risk that the player\nneed to take is expansion timing. It is best to avoid spending the wealth\nbefore the strike of a meteor with high hitting probability. In one incident,\ndespite the fact that the bar was above the level goal, a late hit, brought the\ndevelopment level below the level goal and caused failure, Thus, a deadly hit\ntowards the end of stage can be too costly. I think, using the insurance is\nonly feasible towards the end of level when a comet with high chance of hit and\npredicted severity. \n\nThe other thing that\nI noticed is that the game levels are not disconnected which makes sense. The\nover-achievements from previous levels as well as the land level are\ntransferrable to the following levels. In fact, it seems that completing the\nhigher levels without surpassing the earlier levels milestones is unlikely.\n\nI will add a feature\nthat expedites the creation of wealth. Aside from and level protection and\nbuying insurance, I did not notice any option for increasing your assets. I\nwill also make the development cost variable. For example, developing a pod\nnext to a more developed pod more expensive and more rewarding.  ",

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe game required the player to identify risk and evaluate them in order to protect their environment. The risks were the result of the comet hitting the land/water and causing waves which produced flooding. I worked through the tutorial a few times before\nstarting the game, fearing that the game would be played out much faster than in the tutorial, but this was not the case. The key trade-offs were between money and security. When I initially played the game, I either did not focus on insurance or undervalued\nthe cost of insurance relative the potential damage caused by the comets hitting the land. After a few iterations, it was clear that it was considerably more beneficial to buy a large amount of insurance and interesting, the game seemed to be played faster\nat that point. Also using the lever to raise the island – another means of disaster mitigation was very effective and even though there was a cost associated with this intervention, I seemed to recover wealth very quickly. The least effective decision\nwas simply to build pods and to ignore the comets. \n\nIf you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game? \n\nAs stated above, after playing the game a couple of times, I realised just how important insurance was to protect the pods and recover from the damage caused by the comets. I initially underestimated the risk the comets posed and was surprised about how damage might vary – in some cases it was over 70 per cent, then it fell to some 25 per cent and in some cases the damage was zero; again depending on the level of insurance purchased and the degree to which I have elevated the island. \n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live? If I were to play the game again, I might suggest introducing some other threats so the players need to choose between more types of intervention. In this instance, the trade off was calculated in terms of financial cost. There was no attempt to introduce other costs e.g. if one had to choose between paying for education, health care etc. or disaster insurance. I live in a developed country (UK) where there is considerable risk of flooding and in fact there was extensive flood damage earlier this year. The Thames Barrier is one example of a costly but effective intervention.",

            "reflection": "It was difficult to win the game. I thought I had managed a good level of understanding of the various moving pieces in the game. I understand how research, insurance and preparedness affect the damage and the costs. I did create most of the pods away from the water body and believed in upgrading as soon as possible. Having insurance is surely a good plan especially when the game has comets flying in all the time. Upgraded pods/Insurance/research- all point to better preparedness. i spent a lot of time monitoring after purchasing all safeguards as soon as possible. After monitoring the comet, I used the slider to raise the level based on the severity of the hit. Having insurance helped in repair  costs which was a god thing. Also, upgraded pods had lesser damage. The time constraint adds a unique difficulty which models the real world when quick actions are required. Research reduces the effects of the comets and its severity. But in the game its difficult to move the to safe green meter in the time given. I have managed it only once in several attempts.  My game code is entered below.RXHvGPk Learning from the game gave indications to the real world where exposure to risks can be managed but costs money and resources. In the game, my resource of constant monitoring. Also, all attempts to create safeguards is not an easy task as it costs money. In the game, all I had to focus on was  managing the risks but in the real world, all costs are driven by day to day living costs. In developing countries, focus in safeguards clearly is hampered due to shortage of cash and the knowledge. Just like I did not do well in the game with having all the resources at my disposal, clearly thought out winning strategy is required in the real world. Without a good risk management strategy, all resources at human disposal will not result in effective risk management. Most places are often hit with flash flooding which can lead to sudden destruction allowing for little time to react and prepare. I will add the ability to add shelters which allow for quick reaction to save human life. Also include the ability for these shelters to respond to a crisis with quick evacuation.",

            "reflection": "Essay\n\nPlaying this particular game allows us to\nreflect about risk management. There is several ways to prepare to future\nproblems, in the game, asteroids, in real life, it can be different types of\ncrisis, and the simplest example is an environmental crisis. If the inhabitants\nof a specific area are vulnerable of suffering certain types of disasters, for\nexample floods due to tropical storms. There are several ways to prepare, like\ntaking insurance, gathering knowledge and raising your protection.\n\nThe game teaches us how to combine the different\ntypes of preparations in a very simple way. You can not only raise your\nprotection because if the severity of the asteroid that hits is high, the\neffect will be harsh. Is the same in real life, if in my country (El Salvador),\npeople always build a barrier to avoid floods in the city’s vulnerable\nneighborhoods, there will still be the risk that the barrier will not resist,\nbut if before building the barrier, you check your data to have an estimation\nof the amount of precipitation during the incoming storm, you can prepare\nyourself better. \n\nIt is very clear how knowledge is indispensable\nto take action, but it is not enough. The risks of being exposed to a crisis are\ntoo high not to have a plan to cope with the effects. In the game, you could\nbuy an insurance which helped with the cost of reparations. When people’s welfare\nis at stake, protection is not enough, because once the shock has passed, it is\nnecessary to have a plan so the people can bounce back, or they will not be\nable to overcome the problem. \n\nI only played this game once, but what I would\ndo different is being more strategic with the way I invested. I bought the most\nexpensive insurance, which was very helpful, and I raised the protection level,\nbut both of those choices were very expensive. The problem was that I could not\ndevelop in time, because I did not have the money to repair and upgrade. What I\nthink I did wrong was that I did not analyze the data of each asteroid, which\nis fundamental when making decisions about risk management.\n\nI do not think that it is necessary to make a\nchange in the game. It presents how difficult it is to choose the right way to\nprepare for a crisis, especially since resources are limited. I understand how\ndata is important to decide what type of insurance is necessary, how much you\ncan invest and what type of protection you need.\n\nJavier Orellana",

            "reflection": "1\n\nThere are plenty of shocks and\nuncertainties. Every time you play, you gain better knowledge of the\nuncertainties. But you cannot be 100% sure of the situation. These shocks, like\nearthquake or flood, are not easy to predict but they come with a certain pattern.\nSo, to protect further damages or unexpected loss, the community must buy\ninsurance to prevent losses. \n\nExperienced shocks and uncertainties\ndon’t guarantee the right prediction next time. Partly because there are always\nnew risk elements, like climate change or global warming, creating more uncertainties.\nThese new risk factors affect the weather or harvesting time or creating new\nand more serious flood. At the same time, when you play the game, you sometime\nforget the risk and suddenly the shocks appear. Even we know the risk we just\nforget to buy insurance.    \n\nThere is a trade-off. You need\n200 to invest for a new well but you need also to upgrade and buy insurance.\nThere are limited funds, even though it may increase (through taxation or\nrevenue), you can either use the extra fund to buy suitable insurance policies\n(one of three depending on your objectives) or upgrade or new investment. \n\nFurthermore, there is a time\nlimit too.\n\n2\n\nI play several times. First\nwith only 2 investments, then I try 4 or 5 investments, each time the\nexperience is different. Nevertheless, I need to adjust between new knowledge,\nprotection and insurance with the limited time and fund. Very often,\nopportunities are lost due to insufficient fund or time. Every time, I have to\ntake the risk against return of new investment, or consider a suitable insurance.\nEven with past or acquired knowledge of the ‘misses, shocks and new investment opportunities’,\nthere is no guarantee I will make the right prediction. There is always a ‘changing’\nrisk. Of course, there is always a gain if I protect myself with insurance\ncoverage and learned experience.  \n\n3\n\nIf I can make one small change,\nI would increase the insurance options from three to five. Shocks are\nunpredictable and so do the damages. But we may not have sufficient fund to buy\nthe minimum package of 33% coverage. I face this problem. I need to wait for the\nfund to grow but I don’t have fund to buy the minimum coverage and so I have to\nwait and the ‘game’ time lost.   \n\nOne of the five options can be\n20% coverage. When we look at the insurance industry, there are many packages\nand some even custom made for poor families, for example in India or Africa. 20%\ncoverage with small insurance premium can help a poor community to overcome\ndifficulties. A small insurance coverage is certainly better than no insurance coverage.\nWorld Bank’s experience in developing countries has proved that insurance does\nmake a difference for these developing countries, for their farmers or factory\nowners.    \n\n",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon Game- My Reflection\nThe risk horizon game provided a fun, and practical, forum for learning how to: 1) prepare for risks/disaster; 2) mitigate the effects of a risk/disaster; and 3) cope, in the event that a risk/disaster does occur. This is reflected within the fundamental principles of Risk Management which revolves around Knowledge, Protection and Insurance. \nWhile playing the game I had decided to concentrate my efforts towards insurance while occasionally neglecting knowledge and protection, after failing to complete level one I had shifted my attention towards insurance and protection, occasionally trying to acquire knowledge, and sometimes neglecting it completing. This too, had contributed to my inability to complete level one.\nEventually, I have discovered that priority was given to risk preparation, resulting in the utilization of a tremendous amount of, already, scarce resources for this purpose, while the overall development of the village/community was neglected.\nIn the event that I had played the game once I would have invested in obtaining more knowledge about the various risk, and the potential effects of these risk, in an attempt to have more operational coping mechanisms in place to mitigate the level of shocks which comes as a consequence of these inevitable risks. Having played that game multiple times I had discovered that I was constantly trying to find a balance between knowledge, protection, insurance and the general development of the community. \nWith reference to protection, I would have invested a tremendous amount of effort into raising the planet, believing this to be the \"easy way out\", but due to the time-oriented nature of the game I would have realized that this approach was, by far, the most inefficient, this had reinforced that there were not a quick fixes when managing risk.\nParticipating in this game had highlighted that risk management, even though simplified, and highly necessary, can be difficult to implement. I would have tried multiple approaches but they all would have had the same results-failure to complete level one, and even when I would have completed level two appeared to be twice as difficult. Essentially I would have learnt that managing risk is essential to development and equal considerations should be place upon knowledge, protection and insurance.\nGiven the task to develop a new version of the game I would have included an optional price list for selecting various level of raising the planet and the corresponding cost of the same.

            "reflection": "\n\nThe role of risk management in this game was to help choose\nthe best mixture of responses to a given threat so the impact would be\nminimised. The game represented to a large extent a classic resources allocation\ndilemma (the resources here being time- for the research and credit –for insurance\nand preparation / protection. The choices involved how much time one should\nallocate researching a given threat (which of course precluded from researching\nother threats, or dedicating time to upgrade the pods), and how many credits\nshould be dedicated, and when, to insurance, upgrading the pods and preparation\n(raising the level). It is obvious that one should take some measures to mitigate\nrisk (prepare and/or build a network) or transfer risk (insurance) otherwise the\ngame is unwinnable. I have tried a mixture of all, as one strategy alone either\nwasn't sufficient (e.g. insurance doesn’t cover all damages) or too expensive\n(e.g. preparation). Also, building networks was quite efficient as it only costs\ntime and not credits. I have found playing the game that investment in\npreparation is at the beginning expensive, but it pays off in latter stages of\nthe game. So a player with adequate preparation is able to address the residual\nrisk with the other measures, whereas without preparation, the game is not\nwinnable. In conclusion preparation, especially in the early stages allows for\nhigher development in the future.\n\nThe main thing I learned after playing the game several\ntimes was that one has to find the right mixture of strategies, depending on\nthe threat (the threat being a factor of chance of impact and severity) and to\nchoose the right response. To find the right mixture takes some time. For me\nthe winning strategy was summarised in: invest early one in protection that\nwill be repayed by development in latter stages; buy insurance for big upcoming\nthreats; check all threats appearing and focus research on the ones that have\nhigh impact and be fast in building networks; ignore (or accept) threats that\ndo not seem serious, there is not enough time of resources for them; keep some\ncredits (I guess these would be called savings) to rebuild if disaster happens.\n\n\nThe one thing I would change to the game is that I would\nmake more transparent the impact and importance of networking. Also, there are\ntwo more standard responses to risk, which would be risk deferral and\navoidance. These I feel were not adequately covered. Otherwise, great job ,very\ndidactic and enjoyable.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1. The risk management role in the game took the highest possible shelf. Without quick feasibility studies of, how severe is the risk, what is the potential damage, as well as the frequency of risk (meteors falling), finance and possible solution to escape losses (in this case development loss, and financial), it was not able to succeed in the game further for 1 round. The tradeoffs in this game are only few, but they present the importance of these key issues: -spend money and time in development, or on insurance policy and raise the island to escape cunami? Therefor it affected the town's development. Development took place well in advance before meteor meets the planet, and after all risks have been neutralized.Key parameter in this game played a knowledge factor, with out knowledge, it is hard to choose and make right decision to prevent disaster. 2. I, Nikita gorbatko, declare that I played the game several times. Therefore every time I failed, I had to analyze my mistakes, like, tradeoffs, add more knowledge, or time to raise the island (preparation), which kind of insurance its better to obtain (50 or 70 percent cover ratio). The last try was the most successful by reaching level 4. Firstly, I developed town in advance before meteor strikes, secondly I have spent lot of time on studying the risk (knowledge), thirdly- valuating how severe is the disaster (preparing for the worst case scenario), 4thly- obtaining proper insurance (according to previously mentioned issues), and last but not least, tried to avoid the consequences (raising the island to prevent flooding). And only after the risks have been avoided, town development continued. A3. As a developer, I would add 1 tiny thing, civilian activity + alarm system. Before a disaster strikes, civilians will have to be warned, in order to prepare for the strike and minimize civilian loss. However, if alarm system will be neglected, it will result in many victims. I think it will give better understanding of natural disaster importance, preparation and well operational team work.   ",

            "reflection": "Risk management was\nat the heart of the game : investigating and identifying hazard\n(comets and sea level rise), reducing exposure (elevating the level\nof security of pods) , addressing the effects and impacts (reacting\nin emergency situation with community links, investing in\ninsurances).\n\nThere were\ntrade-offs but rather between development goals and risk management\nmeasures. A mix of measures with knowledge, protection and insurance was necessary. \n- Research. As\nsoon as comets appeared, it was worth investing in research to\nidentify hazard (severity) and exposure (chance of hits). I have used research to win extra time to make connections but cannot assess whether this was a successful strategy. I did not spot a case where\nthe risk of one comet  (severity/chance of hit) changed during the\ncourse of the round. I would have expected that more research help\nyou to better identify the risk (reduce uncertainty – better\nassessing the chance of hit for instance as the comet got closer).\nHowever, I did not see this feature and the risk when the comet\nappeared in the sky remained constant until it crashed or not.\n\n- Insurance was\ndefinitely a good deal.  It was better to purchase it while the\ncomet was getting close (which I believe does not reflect products\nthat are offered by insurance companies). The price of insurance did\nchange between rounds but I did not have the chance to spot if it was\nbecause :- my assets (pods) were upgraded (and therefore costed more to\nprotect) or\n\n- because the costs of insurance increased as the risk of one comet\ncrashing was materialising or\n\n- because my insurance had been already used once and insurers were\nwilling to offer protection at a higher price\nMy risk averse\nbehaviour always got me to purchase the 75 % insurance, I never\ncalculated precisely the price of my assets (perhaps a reminder of\nthe worth of what you have built on the page, would help calculating\nthe right ratio for insurance). Only roughly.  The highest for a 75 %\ninsurance was 239 currency units, while building a pod costs around\n200, upgrading costs 187. So when I had 4 upgraded pods, I figured\nthat insurance would be worth it without making the detailed\nassessment.\nOnly once, I could\nnot purchase the 75 % insurance because I did not have enough\nmoney. \n\nIn addition, there\nwas also a problem of display in the game. Between rounds, the\ninsurance you had purchased and not used in one round was appearing\non the screen while in reality I was not covered by insurance. I\nshould have better checked that my contracts was in order.\n\n- Protection-\nelevating pods\nThis was the most time consuming measure, destracting from development goals.\nHowever, I noticed that once you had invested the time into it, it\nwas valid on the long-term and from one round to the other. So, this was a good investment. Nevertheless, I lost when I tried to increase my level of protection to 4. There were better ways to use my resources.\nLimitationsRisk management is only linked to\none type of risk coming from out of space. The difficulty of risk\nmanagement comes from the multiplicity of risks and high level of\nuncertainty and what to prioritise. So, I would advocate for at least\nincorporating another layer of risk in the game. Also, some of the\nmost important risks that mankind has to address are man-made risk.\nIt would have been good to reflect on this and see how development\nitself bears risks (bad management of resources, climate change,\ntoxic waste and chemicals accumulating).\n\n",

            "reflection": "Its only one way to win in this game - to use risk management tools. Because destruction are always happen.At first stages i more invest in pods, because cost of mistake is pretty low (but you should look at meteors (risks) when you see any with high probability of high destruction - buy 75% insurance immediately!) And sure i always have protection on 4 marks level at least.I played twice - all that i changed next is that i never accumulate a lot, always reinvest But i dont finished 6 stage because pods did not have time be repaired until deadline.Its funny. but after 2 week of course I thought about buying insurance and general health check. in the new version, I would add different mechanisms of knowledge management - now its only to observe the meteorites, but how about accumulate the knowledge? At the beginning of all meteorites are same and only after the observations for the level to level they came more predictiable.Plus it will be better to make some kinds of cycle events - lots of risks are cycle (such as financial crisis)",

            "reflection": "I believe that in this game risk management has the role both of preventing the negatives effects of a shock, by building connections, elevating the terrain and upgrading the pods, and coping with the aftermath of the shock, by having insurance.I played the game once, and reached level 4, having successfully completed 3 levels.After building the first pods, my first concern was to buy the highest insurance, and I also did research for as long as possible so that I could have more time to build connections in order to minimize the risk. On the second level I upgraded the pods and did the research but I didn't buy the insurance and as a result when the sock it, it coasted more to repair the pods and my development level fell. On level 3, the last one that I completed successfully, I bought the insurance, again the highest and elevated the terrain as much as possible, I also did the research for as long as I could.On level 4 that I didn't complete, if played again I would spend more time upgrading the pods, so that my development would rise faster and less time elevating the terrain.As to the last point on the assignment, the only thing that occurs to me now is making the elevation of the terrain faster, and not as detrimental to the development.",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection By Ajibola Akeju\n\n \n\n1.  Risk management technique or processes was\nvery useful in playing the risk horizon game. \nIt involved the interplay of knowledge, protection and insurance in\nmanaging the risk posed by the falling meteors which strikes the planet and\ndamages it. \n\nThere\nwas continuous trade-off between the three components – knowledge, protection\nand insurance, taking into cognizance the available resources for developing\nthe planet (represented by the available funds) in the presence of risks and\nthe accompanying shocks if the risk event (falling meteors) materializes.  There was also the interplay of the economic\nprinciple of “opportunity cost” in selecting the component of risk management\nto choose at any point in time considering the available resources.\n\nKnowledge\nplayed an important role in knowing the severity and likelihood of damage from\nthe meteor, while insurance was important in fixing the damage after it occurred.  Protection was also important in making the\nplanet cope with the shocks.  However,\nfor me, the game showed the importance of insurance which we in the developing\nworld usually ignore.\n\nThe\ngame showed that preparation is the bedrock of risk management using the\ncomponents of knowledge, insurance, and protection.\n\n \n\n2.  I played the game up to ten times, though I\ndid not go through the tutorials initially. \nThis helped me in playing the game without any guide to risk management\nand showed clearly the disastrous effect of not preparing for risks, because I\ncouldn’t go past Level 2.  After going\nthrough the tutorial and learning about the game and how to play it (shows the\nimportance of knowledge and information gathering), I was able to play the game\nand get to Level 4. This taught me the importance of preparation and making use\nof knowledge, protection, and insurance to manage risks and cope with the\naftermath of the shocks emanating from the occurrence of the risk event.\n\n \n\n3.  In developing a new version of the game for\nmy country, Nigeria, I would stress the importance of the all the components –\nknowledge, protection, and insurance. \nHowever, I would highlight insurance as a component that we must start\nto embrace in order to prepare for and cope with risk.  Taking up insurance is not popular here and\nmost people lack basic knowledge about its importance. \n\n  ",

            "reflection": "On the first sight, it seemed that the game is pretty chilldish and simple with all this graphics, music and the story of this little planet. My first thought as that I'm going to beat it in the first try without any troubles. Oh, how wrong was I. When I couldn't pass the third stage because the green bar on the left didn't match the expected level int the allowed time, I was confused. Why did it happen? I was sure that I didn't make any mistakes. All was going so right, all the free places on the ma were covered with my pods, that I upgraded all the time. Also, on every level i bought the 75% assurance and it was clear for me, that my little planet is safe and I'm going to have a lot of money in the future, because i wasn't supposed to lose a lot of money by repairing the pods at full cost. Still, i lost. On the second try, I realized that I spent to much time on building protection, because by the time I spent my time on lifting may pods above the water level, the bar on the left became red and my virtual country was not evolving. I understood, that the same happens in every economy. If we spend to much time and money on thoughtless and exagerated risk management, our economy and society evolve at a very small rate, or maybe remain at the same place. So, the more i prepaired for risk, the less i developed my virtual country. I decided to modifiy my strategy, and it worked. First of all, i didn't spend precious time and money on builidng an escessive protection when the time for a strong one still didn't come. I directed the biggest part of mye efforts to the development of my pods, and bought the assurance only when it was necessary. The second important thing i deduced was, that there is no nedd to build a protection of a very high level, even on the 4th and 5th stage. Instead, I tried to research the comets that represented the biggest level of risk, so, when it felt in the water, i would be prepared to build as much community connections as possible. Doing this, my protection level prevaled the severity of the comets, and after that i just put a few efforts to increase my protection by one ore two levels, because it decreases automatically after the comet hits. Still, my strategy didn't allow me to pass the 5th level, because I lacked two or three seconds to rich the milestone. So, the thing I learned from the game are the next ones:- is not enough to put attention only on one aspect of risk management (e.g. insurance); only using all of them can help us prevent and cope the risk, and by the same time have a fast development- the potential risks appear at different times (even one after another) and we can not find a precise trend (e.g. two dangerous comet can fall one after another)- community connections are very inportant in risk managementSo, if i had the posibility to change something in this informative game, i would make it a little more difficult by adding a new aspect - the conflict of interest between the members of the community, because this kind of risk is an important one in the country where i live. I wouls introduce the conflict of interests in the moment, when you are making community connections between the pods.",

Failing to manage the\nrisks adequately results in loss and the end of the game.\n\nRisk management is composed of\ndifferent elements and finding the right balance among them leads to success.\n\nKnowledge allows to predict likelihood\nand magnitude of threatening events and, though it cannot prevent them from\nhappening, it can help to plan the steps to be undertaken to mitigate their\nconsequences (i.e. purchasing a better insurance and increase the protection of\nthe area if the risk is major, or continue developing if the risk is minor).\n\nProtection helps reduce the exposure to risks and minimize the impact\nof the shock, thus reducing the damages; while insurance helps reduce\nloss by making reconstruction less expensive.\n\nAll activities require time and\nmoney, therefore focusing the efforts or overspending on one of them affects\nthe capacity of working on the other (i.e. spending too much money on insurance\nleaves little balance for building or upgrading pods; spending too much time on\nresearch does not allow enough time for developing or reconstructing, etc). \n\nPreparation for risk can lead to\nmore sustainable development, especially on a long term period. Preparation may\nrequire to reduce the speed of development, as time and resources need to be\ninvested in research and setting up of preventive measures, but at the same time\nit minimizes the possibility of destruction and the need of spending on\nreconstruction at a later stage. \n\nI have played several times and\nat the beginning it was not very easy to understand what to do. Though\ninstructions were given, they were not completely clear. In spite of being\nfrustrating, learning from the previous failures helped me understand what went\nwrong and to find ways to change the approach and reach better results. \n\nAfter the first tentative spent\non rushing to put in practice all possible options and guessing the best one, I\nhave started taking more time to reflect on how to relate each option to the\nother so as to maximize their combined effect. \n\nThe game taught me that patience\nis needed in risk management. Though it is easy to associate risks management to dealing with emergencies, it shall not be rushed or improvised, as management tools may\nbe ineffective if they are not properly related to the situation they are\napplied to. From the game I have also learnt that risk management requires multitasking efforts, as different dimensions must be addressed and taken into account at the same time.\n\nIf a new version of the game may\nbe developed I would add some connections outside the island, so as to\nrepresent the different stakeholders engaged and their different\nresponsibilities. This element would give an idea of the\ncomplementary/subsidiary roles of communities, states, international community,\netc. in risk management.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game is\nthe central government, which is responsible for the development and protection\nof city. Because  I have limited resources and time, and I have to balance\namong knowledge, protection and insurance. Firstly, I should build pods to\nguarantee the development and enough resources. I build 2-3 pod at the first\ntime, since I can not spend all my money.  And then I should do the\nprotection and keep an eye on the upcoming comets. I should get knowledge from\nwatching the comets. If it is not too severe, like 1-2, Just keep watching to\nget knowledge. If it is immense severe, I will buy the insurance to do the\nprotection. I should put more time on watching the comets, since it will bring\nme more time to connect pods if the comet destroy the city.  At the meantime,\nI should continually build the pods. I do not need save much money on my\naccount, and it is better to use the money to develop. Above level 3, If I put\nmore attention on protection, it will affect the development. Sometimes, I can\nnot finish development within the time the game gives us.  If I play the\ngame more than once, I will change the time and sequence among protection, knowledge,\ninsurance and development. I will do as follows: development, protection,\nknowledge and insurance. I do not put much money on insurance unless the severe\nof comet is very high. I can put my money on development if the severe of comet\nis low. With the level I won, I can add more pods to build.  If I task\nwith developing a new version for the game, I think I should label the level\nclearly. Sometime I even do not know which level I am playing. I will reduce\nthe time of connection of pods. It takes too long to connect and sometimes it\nneeds 60 time connection. It is a bit boring. I will give more tips on every\nlevel and teach the player how to success. The last but not the least, if you\nsuccessful play the level 3, if you lose level 4, does not play it again from\nlevel 1. It wastes time. I think the purpose of the game is to teach us how to\nmanage the risk, so it is important about the game design. The game is to teach\nus how to manage, but not just a game.\n\n",

            "reflection": "First of all I have to say that I found this\ngame quite interesting because it served as a useful platform to experience the\nrisk chain and the components of Risk Management, all the way from preparation\nto coping, in a fun and didactic way.\n\nIn this case, I believe that the shock presented\nitself in two ways: as the chance of a comet hitting my colony in Alora, and as\nthe possibility of a financial crisis, this is, not having enough resources to\nachieve the level of development required to be successful and win the level. \n\nThe external environment was reflected on the\nposition of the island, if it was higher or lower, which is, in turn, quite\nrelated with the component of protection, which I will address later. \n\nOn the other hand, the internal conditions where\nreflected on the amount and size of the pods, which are also related to the\ncost of insurance, another component I will talk about later as well.\n\nNow, the role of risk management is primary in\nthis game because the main objective is to find a balance between obtaining knowledge\n(severity of the comet, chance of hitting etc), investing in protection or\ninsurance, two components that may or may not be needed, or risking to use the\nmoney on upgrading the pods. I find interesting that a piece of data which is\nnot available in the game, is how much does the income increases with each\nupgrade of the pods. This is the element I would add to the game because it\nwould allow the decision maker to calculate better future investments in\nrelation with the time remaining before the stopwatch reached 00:00. More knowledge\nand data availability are also components that I would prefer to have in my\ncountry (Mexico) where transparency is still a challenge. \n\nI played the game several times and first I\ninvested all my money in developing and upgrading pods, while neglecting both protection\nand insurance. The results were catastrophic. The next time I tried to balance\nthe investment of resources between those three options and the conditions\nimproved consistently. \n\nAn outstanding lesson of this game is that\nknowledge is a powerful tool and it can be more useful to know how to deal with\npossible shocks before they take place, than to have more money to invest in coping\nwith the effects of a disaster in which there was no risk management ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to reduce the\nimpact or damage caused by comets through the use of different combinations of  resource allocation. The resources were to be\nallocated  in research, protection and\ninsurance with different mix at the same time considering the budget\nconstraint. As an example one might use more research but this would mean less\nprotection from the hits given the type of insurance taken. Protection is how\nyou can protect against comets .Risk management entails that if your protection\n matches the severity of a comet that\nhits, you will be fully protected. The more time i spent with the comet selected,\nthe more research I had will collect, but this took away time i could spend\ndoing other actions, hence, it was all about balancing. The more research i had\ndone, the more time I had to make community connections before a shock hits. This\nis another way I had to prepare for incoming shocks if the protection had  begun to cost too much money. When I purchased\nan insurance plan, I knew was covered for the rest for the round against\nresiduals that would befall me after taking \nprotection. Damaged growers were also be cheaper depending on the\nplan  bought. Preparation played a\npivotal role in ensuring that resources were allocated efficiently to different\ncompeting uses. As a result, the extent of damage was reduced allowing the\ncommunity to cope after a shock.\n\n If I were to play the\ngame again I would try and focus more on protection because this would increase\nthe chances of reducing the damage living room for insurance to play a minimum\nrole. I have learnt that in society we face resource constraints in dealing\nwith different risks, how we allocate these finite resources will determine the\nextent to which we are able to withstand shocks from risks such as natural\nhazards. A balance between knowledge, protection and insurance needs to be\nreached. I also learnt that it would be extremely difficult to use protection\nwhen you do not have research or knowledge about the risk you are facing which in\nturn will hinder your ability to choose an appropriate insurance cover.\n\n If I am tasked with developing\na new version of the game I would make the game simple to understand through\nthe use of simple language and would provide more clearer information to the\nplayers. I would focus more on the learning aspect of the game as opposed to\ncomplexity. This, I would achieve by making the game interactive, for example,\nwhen one chooses the right balance on preparation, a compliment should be given\nsaying ,“well done, excellent or good”, to say the least  or perhaps giving hints in order for one to\nreduce the damage during the game.  I would\nconcentrate on the specific preparation methods pertaining to drought and\npoverty caused by lack of adequate rainfall as well as disease prevention as\nthese challenges reflect the place I live.",

If we do\nthat, we won’t have money left to develop more and to have better ways to\nprevent risks. \n\nIn return, a good preparation for risk can\nallow us to keep a correct rate of development and, avoiding important damages,\nthe development won’t slow down too much.\n\n2.       I played the game three times. The\nfirst time, I was focusing a lot on risks and not at all on development. The\nsecond time, I tried to spend less money in preparing for risk and on insurance\nto ensure a good development rate. The third time, I tried to manage more\nefficiently the preparation regarding the risks. I tended to spend a lot of\nmoney trying to have no damage at all but I realize it was not realistic.\n\nThe game\ntaught me that preparing for a risk involves a good knowledge of the risk and\nthat we always need to make sacrifices and make the better of the worst\nsituation. All is about moderation and balance. \n\n3.       I think the role of people is not\ninvolved enough in the game. Protection, with infrastructure and insurance are\nwell represented and their role are quite accurate but knowledge of inhabitants\nare not. I think the game leaves out the role of prevention towards citizens\ntoo blurred. As it takes place on a community scale, I would think it is quite\nimportant to mention not only equipment damage but physical as well. But as the\ngame simplified the notion of risk management it seems difficult to embrace all\naspects while keeping it simple and easy to reach.",

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk management in the game was to develop Alora community by development of undeveloped pods as many as possible through different stages protection and optimizing insurance levels from comets hitting Alora community. To understand the game takes some time. Initially I could not win even Level 1 as I tried to acquire maximum undeveloped pods without paying attention to protection. But then I purchased just three pods and then went for development in stages while protecting them through raising levels and  at least 50% insurance levels. When I had some surplus source for purchasing new undeveloped pods, i went for that. This way helped me to win Level 2 of the game. But in Level 3, it was difficult to achieve development of pods as comets were hitting frequently and the level of damage was high. So whatever growth achieved through development was not enough to raise the protection and get properly insured.2. After playing the game once, the second time my strategy was to purchase just few Three) undeveloped pods, protect them by raising levels and also insuring them at least 75%. This strategy worked well. But while playing Level 3 twice, I observed that even when I purchase just three pods for development, I was not able to protect them by raising stages of levels or insuring sufficiently as I did not have sufficient resources for level raising or insurance. This was due to rise in the frequency of comets hitting Alora and the degree of damage and cost of repairing pods. So managing resources available for development of pods while paying attention to protection by the level raising and keeping the cost of repairing the damaged pods by insuring sufficiently was the key factor in achieving development of Alora.3. While developing a new version of the risk management game, I would like to include some of present major risks faced by  all of us. Instead of comet hitting, I would like to include scenarios of earthquakes or floods. Also, if possible, the major problem of the climate change (rise in the global average temperature) due to rise in CO2 emissions could be realistically highlighted through such game. In my place, which is Pune, Maharashtra in India, the management of water resources has become very important. In Maharashtra, some regions are frequently affected due to scanty rains some years and very heavy rains other years. The monsoon pattern has also changed. Every year the state government has to provide relief aid to farmers, which does not reach to affected farmers. Even after spending more than US $12 Billion on improvement in irrigation facilities in last decade, improvement is less than 1% as per the data published by the state government. So the risk management should include bringing more awareness in the people about changing the climate, which is affecting the monsoon and how they can manage risks through changing crop pattern, adopting better methods of farming using less water and taking crop insurance. This is possible if the state and central government takes lead and educate the people in managing risks and achieving development of the self and communities.",

            "reflection": "In the Risk\nHorizon game, risk management helped to reach the next level of development. I had\nto manage how to spend money and make trade-off between development and either\nknowledge, protection, and insurance. Actually I had to find an equilibrium\nbetween these four components. Knowing about the comets helped me to adjust the\nlevel of protection, and to cover the uncertainty by an accurate level of\ninsurance. It also gave me more time afterwards to build connection and enhance\nprotection.\n\n Preparation for risk helped me lessen the\nnegative impacts on my development and helped me recover faster.\n\n\n\nI played\nthe game several times. Actually on first run, I put all my money on\ndevelopment and forgot to use research and protection. It was a disaster and I\nfailed immediately. \n\nOn the\nsecond run, I used protection by did not understand that the level of\nprotection to be reached could be trigger by the knowledge about the level of\nrisk. So I spent too much money on protection and failed to develop enough!\n\n\n\nThen I\nadopted this strategy:\n\n-       \nDeveloping\n3 plots\n\n-       \nResearching\nabout the comet\n\n-       \nAdapt\nmy protection level before betting on development\n\n-       \nGet\na minimal insurance\n\n-       \nIf\ndamages occurred, repairing my plots before developing other ones.\n\n-       \nDevelop\n2 new plots and improve my first 3 ones.\n\n-       \nResearch\nabout the next comet\n\n-       \nAdjusting\nthe level of protection and getting a stronger level of insurance as I was\ngetting wealthier, so having more money to lose. I also could afford it more\neasily. \n\nIt led me to level 5. The game\nlearned me not to hurry on development. This must be done with measurement of\nthe degree of hazard I could have to face. If I ignore the risk, I am unable to\nmake judgement about consequences of a shock. On the other hand, knowing what\noutcomes could be helps me preventing and lessen negative effects. When\nuncertainty is high, insurance can help me face the consequences of the shock\nand recover earlier (in the game repairing was cheaper with insurance). \n\nKnowing better\nabout the level of risk, and especially when estimation of risk was low, made me decide to\ngrow with less fear.\n\nIf I could\nadd something to the game, it would be the uncertainty of money value over time.\nAs an individual I cannot influence this parameter. Inflation is a big issue in\nthe place I live and exchange rate can have a big influence on our lives and\nthe type of development to be involved in. But maybe it is close to comet and\nwe just have to have knowledge about it to adopt an accurate response to this\nconcern…\n\n\n\n\n\n",

In playing Risk Horizon, I found - after many times failing at level 1 - that insurance is very, very useful, in recovering after a comet strike. I found that in order to achieve success, I had to prepare for that occurrence, and invest in insurance, even if it seemed to be  a loss at that moment. I gladly gave up knowledge and was happy to slow down the development of the pods in order to make sure that I had the best kind of insurance that I could afford at any given time, knowing that even though the probability of being hit hard was not that big, it only takes one heavy blow to make me lose the game. One of the features that would make the game more realistic would be to not take the whole amount that is due for building or upgrading right after you've selected it, but gradually. It would be more realistic to be asked for an initial investment, that would be a portion of the total cost, and then the balance to be taken as the building progresses. I would also allow to pause the building and the development progress, but I would penalize for the pause accordingly (a smaller amount, of course). ",

            "reflection": "This is a very informative and interesting game in the sense that inorder to complete my task in the given time inspite of coming across multiple obstacles like comets in this scenario, I had to strike a complete balance between all the three activities. I have to keep on planting pods, I have to buy insurance and I also have to make my village strike proof. This not only involves time management but also resource management. Choices and Tradeoffs:1. I have to keep on planting my pods so that I will not left without pods before the time expires. 2.I have to keep track of the severity of the commets and ensure my village can sustain them by providing protection.3.I insured my village using the minimal insurance available as i already provided protection to my pods. This way, I am able to manage resources.I attempted this game multiple times and I was not successful the first time. Some times, I was providing a lot of protection. So I was not left with enough resources to create my village. The other time, I was just planting the pods, which didnt leave me an opportunity for disaster recovery. I realised the importance of insurance and balance. The third time i attempted, I could strike a balance between all these activities due to which I completed the game successfully.Along with protection and insurance, I would like to incorporate a growth mechanism using which I can be scored against the number of pods that I am able to plant in addition to the minimum required ones. This gives me a chance to understand how much extra i could have performed under the same given scenarios.",

            "reflection": "The main role of risk management in the game was to minimize\nthe risk by learning more about the falling comets, adding insurance based on\nhow well we felt about managing all the elements together while protecting\ngrowing-planet Alora from devastation.I chose to learn more about the falling comets and\nwaiting to get more money to spend on development, protection and insurance. As\nsoon as I got the information regarding the severity and the chance of hit of\nthe comets, I spent money in protecting Alora from possible hits. That helped\nme to avoid getting the highest insurance fees while researching more about\neach of the comets, and having more time to cope after the hits.\nSo, preparation for risk did affect development, but always in a positive way\nfor Alora. \n\n\n\nI did not feel the imminent risk the first time I\nplayed the game. I did not know what to expect at all. So, I think that is what\nusually happens during a crisis if we know little about it; if we have not\ntaken some time to learn more about it. I would have definitely learned more\nabout the game, re-read the instructions and make sure I managed all the\ninformation the best way possible before I hit the start bottom. The second\ntime I played the game, I only reached level 2, but I realized that I had to\nunderstand and control at the same time all the elements that intervened in the\ngame to successfully complete it. The third time I played the game, I came up\nwith a strategy, and I was able to go through level 5. It felt awesome! \n\nThe game was good. I feel it is a smart way to compile\nall the information about risk and opportunity, and share it with others. At\nfirst, I thought I would probably add more time, since it is only a game. At\nsome point, I felt the pressure for not moving to the next level, and during\nthe 3 minutes, I seriously did all I could to save Alora from falling comets.\nBut, I guess that is the way it should be.\n\n\n\nSince famine, floods, droughts and economic crises are\nreal life situations that are not easy to draw or illustrate nowadays, I was\nhappy the game used a hypothetical nation, and illustrative elements to denote\nall that was happening.\n\n\n\nAfter playing the game, I feel even more confident\nabout the fact that we can develop our nations while diminishing impacts by\nequilibrating research, insurance and protection in only one strategy.",

            "reflection": "Risk Management has been a very essential entity for the progress of the community. This is what the game symbolizes and makes us realize the importance of the Risk management. Development  for a nation or an entity needs research which in turn is dependent on technology which also is based on the resources. A developing nation or community cannot plan to focus on research avenues available for development mainly because of high investments. After surpassing the initial stage, resources can be utilized and invested in research avenues. On the whole, the game paid importance to between the growth in development percentage and the level of the ground barrier to be made. Also the research was essential for the community development and overcome the losses occurred during the period. The more time spent on each , the more data gets gathered. Planning and preparation towards research enables the community to showcase better communication and quicker rehabilitation. An arena which needs to be developed, also needs better communication network. For example Disaster Management Devices need to be used in disaster prone areas to save humanity and life stock. A better insurance needed to cope up with losses and essential for minimum investment. Insurance provides a better outlook and more opportunities for development. An insured person can do more work and utilize better resources in better manner. A real truth is that shows that time and resources utilized. That resulted in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I kept some resources for research and preparedness also. Most important, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management determines your prepareness to all aftermath of disasters. In early stages more efficient strategy is readiness to results of disasters. During all gaming time you are moving on the sharp edge of blade. If you didn't pay enough attention to protection so that in next stages you will have nothing instead of new deal with insurance agency which with each round increase price of their service. You need to make decisions based on your winning from the situation, however you can't estimate how much you win or lose after disaster if you didn't experience it. That's why this game can partly substitute for us some experience and give to us new more flexible sight on problem.Game showed me that preventing of disasters and preparing to them in most cases are more important activities than obtaining of insurance payments for aftermath. Most of times I failed at 2nd or 3rd stage because I didn't mention how protection is good. Sometimes with getting insurance your cost of repairing buildings is low, but in late stages it's not as efficient as protecting. Because from stage to stage you lose your insurance contract and need to deal the new more expensive contract. And at some point you don't have money to sign insurance, and your city is defenceless. But if you in early stage were attentive to protection activities so you can leave some money for upgrading of buildings and take the cheapest insurance contract (because it will be enough). However I reached the point that now I'm always losing at stage 4 and I didn't find the best strategy. So I keep going to beat this game :)This game reveals to us how we should estimate each possible disaster and what kind of activities we should implement to avoid any damage and loss from it. I live in Kiev and we don't have nature disasters. And our biggest problem is our Parlament where all officiaries don't serve to their people, but try to satisfy own needs or needs of 3rd party organizations. However, from year to year we have in the end of spring and at the beginning of summer in city goes pipes checking and fixing. And with these checkings take from 3 to 5 weeks so people can get sick from cold water, because not every can buy and house-boiler to heat water for getting shower. So I would like to propose to our government to change their checking schedule and modify their tools and technologies. ",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon Game ReflectionThe role of risk management was to promote or continue development by building resilience and using tools for risk management.  I realized a bit into the game that protection had to be implemented when the threat was not imminent. And to use knowledge and research to prepare for an imminent risk rather than protect at that very time. Also, it’s worth having insurance in advance of a risk, as it gives you some resilience financially and allows you to continue development. Making community connections helped me cope with the aftermath of the shock and took me further into the game.When I played the game again, I protected myself with insurance beforehand and also raised my level of protection to only the required need, as it not only took away my time, but also dropped the bar to red. I still struggled with juggling between protection and development though. I also tried to continue developing as and when resources were available as that was the key to success.I learnt at the end that it is important to balance strategies in risk management to achieve the end goal of development and coping successfully. We must use our knowledge and research to protect ourselves as otherwise it may lead to unnecessary use of resources and also give a false sense of protection. Insurance is an excellent way of shock absorption, as it at least dampens the effect of financial shock through a situation. It also leaves you with some resources to carry on your task. A fine balance and forethought is always needed to manage risk in any situation.I would add a new feature in my version, wherein the tools of risk management would be divided based on individual, community, state and so on. This would give a better idea as to how I could manage risk at a personal level. It would teach me to balance various tools of risk management that an individual has and also utilize help provided by community, etc. It would also teach me how I could contribute to risk management in my community. I would encourage my community to familiarize themselves with tools of risk management like knowledge, protection, coping, etc.. Also, I think it would be very beneficial to first outline the risks faced by my community, for e.g. Earthquakes, so risk management could be specific. ",

            "reflection": "Question 1: In order to succeed in this game, you would require to reach a good balance of knowledge (research of the comets), protection (raising the community), insurance (purchasing it based on risk of collision). It is difficult to do well in the game, as choosing one decision will sacrifice another aspect. Choices I had to make include;1) Spending limited money to purchase insurance, the trade-off being not able to use that sum topurchase upgrades, and raising the community. 2) Spending the time researching the comets, the trade-off being the time I have used it to raise the community 3) Choosing the number of pods I would like to build,  the trade-off being the height and grade I would sacrifice if Ichose to build many pods.  If I know the risk of collision is low; 1) I would not purchase insurance, and use that sum to make more pods. 2) I would use the time to raise the community 3) I would build the maximum number of pods The converse would be true where risk of collision is high. Question 2: To succeed at the game, you'll need to play it multiple times to understand what needs to be done in maximising the opportunity. The tips and hints given after each game is helpful in understanding the rules of the game. From the game I learnt that experience is important in order to get better at the game, by playing the game multiple times I am able to understand the dynamics and the trade-offs and decisions that needed to be made. Question 3: It would be useful to know the hidden rules of the game, for example does more knowledge result in a lower risk of collision, how does raising the community affect the impact of a collision? These tips only came out after the end of a game, it would be interesting to see how my decision making would have changed from the start if I had all the information in hand before starting the game. I would also find it helpful to have a real-time reporting gauge that shows me the proportion of funds used to date on knowledge, on protection and on insurance, having this would be useful in my decision making. ",

            "reflection": "Using scientific research,\nestimations and know-how risk management aided in the assessment and oftentimes\nprotection of the pod community. Similar to real life scenarios, where there’s\na constant need of medical, scientific and managerial skills, the timing and\nimpact of destruction are many times unknown. We can consider solving an isolated\nproblem but is that sufficient? \n\nMatters of increased risks\nincluded the lack of financial assistance, lack of accurate information\nregarding the time and probability of an event occurring (in this case\ndisaster) and the lack of further protection from the meteor. This reminds me\nof the Tsunami that killed thousands of people years ago. It came without\nwarning, sweeping families and homes many of which were never the same again. The\ngame reminds us of the importance of land-use planning, technical measures,\nemergency planning, crisis management, recovery support mechanisms and\ninsurance. Vulnerable areas face more environmental thus the need for risk\nassessment and hazard assessment. Its obvious manmade works cannot compare to\nnatural disasters. Luckily for me, I was able to utilize the $175 premium to cover\n75% of collateral damage.  Sadly, persons\nview insurance as an expensive option where many choose to not opt for it. I also tracked the movement of the meteor and the possible strike by the meteor. Being near the coast, the developer also must consider wave damages or even hurricane. Living in a  hurricane prone area, I've seen people take disaster preparedness very lightly. The result usually is huge damages ans the lack of finances to repair the property. The insurance aid was received quickly. Initially, I found the game a bit confusing. The aim of the game was disaster preparedness, protection and recovery. Insurance and meteor tracking were the only protection measures available. Additionally, I did not understand the glow. Some levers go up as protection but no protection measure is noticeable. The pod upgrades were not well explained. The grass was appealing but is it functional for the development. Collaboration between developers, designers and management should also be included in the game. To play the game again, I would develop the property slower instead of constructing the entire site simultaneously.To add to the game, I would develop the community further away from the water. Persons would become frantic as we experience in real life and the need for food and sanitary conditions after the strike. The communication channel would be interesting during the disaster. To change some of the game, I would add more protection alternatives and add people that live in the pod. I definitely understood the work of the disaster recovery personnel. I also learnt the importance of research and predictions before and during disasters. In the article \"Preparation, Enforcement and Development of Disaster plans, the author highlights few areas we can follow. These include consistency with higher level plan decisions\n\nConsideration of natural constraintsSocio-economic viabilityCompatibility of land use directionsFeasibility of the planApplicability of the planSt Lucia's Ministry of Public Works and Settlements suggest:Appropriately trained and qualified technical staff in planning and building departments to carry out plan review and inspection  Appropriate facilities and equipment for the storage and use of map and plan materials  Enforcement authority and administrative and political support for removal of non-conforming structures Emergency relief operations\nconcerns the community holistically. The group as a whole, meeting physical\nneeds of food, clothes, and shelter and individually where assessment of the individual’s\nsocial and psychological well-being post-disaster. The report further recommends\nincorporating land management, planning, regulation systems and\nsustainable implementations of vulnerable zones. Risk developments is vital for community growth. ",

            "reflection": "The role in\nthis game is to have the responsibility about making decisions in order to\nmanage risk by the best way to protect and save the virtual community. The\nfirst time I played, I was very confused about the game. I understood that the\nmost important thing was to make the best decisions to protect my community,\nbut I didn't know how to do it by the best way. I thought the meteorites always\ncould damage my community. It was for that reason I tried to have the best\ninsurance every time. Perhaps I decided to have unnecessary high protection.\nAfter playing more times, I could test that it is very important to know the new\nrisk situation before decide to hire insurance. This game it’s a good way to\nrealise how important is the risk management and who information allows us to\nmake the best decisions. Risk management allows taking advantage of critical\nsituations. In this game, I could check how the community was growing by making\ngood decisions, investing in insurance, knowledge or protection. In spite of\nthat, obstacles appeared when meteorites damaged all community building. Lack\nof information about how the meteorite can damage the community before it hits\nthe ocean was a critical situation.\n\nWhen I\nplayed the first time, I knew that the most important thing is to check every\nmeteorite before made decisions. It’s very important to have insurance, but\nalso to build knowledge and protection. Playing more times, I discovered that\nprotection and knowledge allow more confidence. Other important question is to\ninvest in knowledge, building new constructions and upgrading others. It’s very\nimportant to know when you have the investment break even in order to stop\nspending money when it doesn't give you enough ROI. Risk management is so\nimportant to develop this virtual community. It consists of preparation and\ncoping. Every time I played a new game, I acquired new knowledge and this allows\nme made best decisions about insurance or protection.\n\nFor develop\na new version of the game, I suggest to register every meteorite experience and\nshow us key information about how it damaged our community before a new and\nsimilar meteorite appears. It’s very important to have references to compare\ndifferent experiences and check which of theirs are similar between them. Other\nthing is to know why the meteorite damages 0% the community. The question is:\nWhy? Having insurance? Investing in knowledge or protection? Perhaps also it\ncould be a good way to develop this game improving the quality of the decisions\nsharing risk experience with others players. For instance, having a discussion\nforum space into the game, allowed players making decision better.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1.      \nRisk management\nin the game permits the player to prepare the village to address the negative\nshocks, the comets. The three options respond to different strategies: with research\n(knowledge), I was able to gain time after the comet collision, reducing the\ndamages of the wave, in the game is a short-term strategy because it protects\nthe village only for that specific comet. The insurance is an effective\nlong-term strategy, to be chosen in the initial phase of the level for a\nlong-lasting protection. Raising the altitude of the village (protection) is between\nthe first two, offering you a valid defence by pushing the button two three\ntime per level. The key is a correct combination of the three approaches, which are more profitable in different times of the game: a good insurance from the initial phases of the level is crucial to incentivate development and observe the possible comets with less concern. Knowlegde when an extremely desructive comet is approaching the planet, is important to increase your post-collision reaction capacities. Protection, in the game, is less easy to define, but it permits the player not to be threatened by minor comets, increasing the time in which he can take care of the village development.\n\n2.      \nI played\nthe game a couple of times. What I progressively learned is something that I\nshould have already known from the lesson: the uncertainty of the risk. The\nfirst time, I relied too much on the information on the comets, trying to react\nto their upcoming impact. Later, I started to prepare the village for a very\nnegative scenario in advance, without paying excessive attention to which type\nof comets were in the sky. In the same time, I took care of the development,\nbeing sure that the bar was green. In this way, even when a catastrophic wave\nhit the village, the damages were limited, and the development just briefly\ninterrupted.\n\n3.      \nI would\nchange the knowledge option. I found it unrealistic that investing in research\nwould have given a benefit limited to that comet. Research is, by far, the strategy\nthat gives its outcome more on the long run than immediately after it is launched.\nWhile observing the comet, the player cannot improve neither the development of\nhis village, nor the other defences, so it is a risky decision that should be\nrewarded with a higher output in the log-term. Contrarily, protection is more\ntime sensible than how much it is shown in the game. Anti-tsunami protections\nrequire constant maintenance and, even when they are effective, they can face\nserious damages after the waves hit them. Therefore, I would suggest decreasing\nthe level of the barrier more intensively after any wave. ",

            "reflection": "I did not understand how to increase the Research points in the game - which in real life is essential in order to prepare for risks. I tried to develop the society as soon as possible, because higher development rate reduces the damages caused by meteors when they hit. I also always aimed for the highest possible level of insurance in order to save costs of damages if they occur. Preparation for risks slows down development, but on the other hand if the meteor hits the community and damages happen, they slow down as well. The main things I learned from the game are: important to invest in development of the society, however not on the cost of risk-preparedness. Insurance in the game plays a big role, which I'm not sure is the case in real life. I played the game four times, on the fourth time I tried to invest in fewer number of settlements but instead develop them as fast as possible. I also learned that if the level of preparedness is too high in comparison to the level of risk of the meteors, the investment is wasted. If I would develop a new version of the game, I would put more attention to the research-component, and also invent different kinds of risks (not only meteors) in order to raise awareness of variety of possible risks hitting communities. In the current version the income is created quite easily - this should be more challenging.",

            "reflection": "                Playing\nthe Risk Horizon game was an interesting experience in terms of enforcing\nprinciples from the Risk and Opportunity MOOC class. I played the game once\nalong with the tutorial, and I reached level 4 before I decided to stop playing\nthe game. While playing the game, I was very keen on risk management and was\nalways conscious of the potential disaster of an asteroid strike. I allocated\nmy resources primarily to ensuring I had a large amount of time to network with\nother communities in the event of an Asteroid strike. In addition to investing\nmoney into raising the platform, I also spent considerable amounts of time\nresearching the dangerous comets. I felt that this was the best strategy to\nprotect my colony on my first play through and I was fortunate enough to not\nexperience any damage as a result of this strategy.\n\n                If I\nwere to play the game again, I would focus more heavily on buying insurance. If\nI had purchased insurance, I would be less likely to invest money and time into\nraising the platform and have more free time to conduct research and more money\nto build my colony. By avoiding insurance and investing money into raising the\nplatform, I restricted my rate of growth and the level of all of my buildings. Investing\nin insurance would have given me more confidence to take chances and grow\nfaster, which in turn would make the game easier to beat.\n\n                If I\ncould add one feature to this game, I would add a scientific prediction feature\nwhich allows investment of money initially to predict comet activity throughout\nthe playing time of the level. By investing in research and receiving the\nseverity and chance of hit for upcoming comets, it would be possible to better allocate\nmoney and thus be more efficient. For example, if a very high severity and risk\nof impact comet is coming later in the game, it is a worthy investment to raise\nthe platform and invest in a high level of insurance. If no severe asteroids\nare approaching, there is limited value insurance and protecting the colony and\nfunds should be allocated for rapid growth instead. This is a technique which\nis widely used in predicting natural disasters and tracking the flu so\ndecisions about allocating funds can be made. I think this is a natural\nprogression for the game which accurately models Canada, where I am from.",

            "reflection": "1. I had to protect and insure my village of pods while I try to gain more resources and cash. It is difficult to balance protection, insurance, and knowledge because if I had to direct one attribute of my village I will have to redirect my resources and cash to it. I didn't have unlimited funds to do everything. My strategy was to insure my village as soon as possible while I try to build and upgrade my pods throughout the level, if there was a particularly high-risk comet coming I had to redirect my resources to protection until it passes.2. The first time I played it through I burned all my cash trying to build my village as quickly as possible without any protection or insurance. This had quickly led to my downfall as I didn't have any resources for protection or insurance to defray the costs of the damage. In the subsequent replays, I tried to balance all three attributes while slowly growing my village.3. If I had designed the game I would have switched the focus from a village of pods to a commercial city, I would have used commercial zones as resource gathering systems and used natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes, fire, and crime to simulate risks.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in my opinion was to place strong foundations in terms of protection and development. If you have a strong level of protection, then you can reduce the magnitude of damage, of course, in order to have an adequate level of protection you need knowledge to better understand how the “shocks” will affect the community and how to best prepare for it. Once all of this is done, you have the foundations needed to employ the insurance that is better suited to the situation, since the information for the transfer of resources comes from these foundations.Because of\ntime constraints, I couldn't play the game as many times as I wanted, so I only\nplayed until I reached level 4. After the first time, I decided to invest less\nin protection as it was too time consuming and affected my progress and\ndevelopment meter. However, I was still stuck in the first level several tries\nlater, despite investing on insurance and knowledge and a bit on development via\nthe pods.  \n\nIt wasn't until\nI started investing more on development, like building every pod and upgrading\nthem that I started to pass the levels. That investment increased my wealth and\ndevelopment meter, which in turn helped me invest more on development and\ninsurance, and let me have more time to observe the comets and thus, increase\nmy protection through the knowledge gained. \n\nUnfortunately\nthe cost was the protection obtained from the lever, as it was too time\nconsuming as I progressed through the levels and I valued knowledge over\nprotection. The comets were too frequent and numerous for me to dedicate much\ntime towards protection. \n\nThe\nconsequences of this risk were immediately showed. Even with insurance and\nknowledge the damage was high. At first, I could afford it because I had enough\nwealth to repair all the pods and recover the damages on the development meter,\nbut as the comets became more frequent I didn't have enough time to repair the\ndamage that was continuously brought by them since my protection was low. Like\nI mentioned above, time constraints prevented me from finding that balance\nbetween protection, development, knowledge and insurance. \n\nA change I would\npropose on a new version of the game, one that represents the risk management\nchoices that matters in the place that I live, is to simplify the way to gain\nprotection. I mention this because I live in the metropolitan area of Mexico\nCity, where, because of the geographical position, we are affected by natural phenomena\nsuch as frequent earthquakes and heavy rain from tropical storms and hurricanes\nfrom either the Pacific or Atlantic oceans. If the way protection is gained is\nmade more efficient and faster, the damage costs would be way lower even if it\nmeans that the protection would be more expensive. Where I live, the necessary knowledge\nis available, but we keep making the same mistakes and seem surprised that we\nare affected by the same things over and over again like floods in certain\nareas and earthquake damages made from: trees planted in sidewalks that\nobstructs people and are on populated sections; utility poles that fall or sway\nin a strong matter and by default, cause blackouts in the areas most affected\nby the phenomena; and rundown buildings that weren't made to resist earthquakes\ndespite the previous knowledge that the area is more susceptible to earthquake\ndamages. Protection is definitely the aspect that needs to be worked on in real\nlife and according to my own experience and lack of balance, the game. \n\n    ",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection :\n\nThe role of the risk management game was to teach how and why risk management is important for healthy development in a specific community with specific needs and urgency. In terms of knowledge, I made sure I understood shocks that may happen or hit an area, prognosticate different types of shocks, following very closely their vicious trajectories, their impact, and possible after effects which may force people to live under harsh conditions for a very long period of time.\n\nIn terms of protection, I had to envision the immediacy of negative impact on the environment, how to reduce the probability and size of losses, and increase the benefits to be derived from the efforts, risk management initiatives taken to ensure viability of decision-making plans, and sustainability. Prepare those who are vulnerable to build resilience in the face of tragedies. \n\nIn terms of insurance, I took great care to consider the transfer of resources across the people within the concerned community, from good to bad status of  the country; cultivating a proactive attitude, taking positive, energetic actions to prevent occurrences, and/or reducing devastating impact on development was my aim objective while playing the game, because I strongly believe that whether risks are systemic (natural disasters, earthquakes, flood/Tsunami), imposed, or idiosyncratic, development can occur only by successfully confronting risks and pursuing available opportunities, making efforts, such as updating technology, making up to date equipment more accessible, in addition to helping the people recover from losses and derive the most benefits. But in the context of the game, pods damaged from flooding can be rebuilt quicker and at a less expensive price; insurance also covers lost development time after the pods are repaired.\n\nActually, I played the game twice, but not completely the second time; so, if I had played it fully the second time around, I would have moved in a more swiftly manner, clicking on the comets that were advancing one following the other before they reached their targets; moving in a swift manner, being vigilant, well prepared, and being proactive, while using the three powers ( Research, Protection, and Insurance) in concert with development to help create a healthy community, in addition to finding the perfect balance, are the main things I learned from the game. In fact, balance risk preparation is very important, seeing that the community falls victim to these falling comets, and we know that the shocks resulted from these comets creep into the water and cause waves that hinder development within Alora.\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, I would recommend the use of larger images with more specific captions for a new version of the game; and this would fit perfectly well, or best represent the risk management choices that matter most in the community where I actually live.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Risk management was represented in the game by displaying conflicting actions that could be performed in differing quantities that would either advantage or disadvantage the outcomes of the risk in differing levels - i.e the effect of a flood/tidal on a growing community from a wave caused by comets crashing into the water. Initially the choices I made were all for insurance and protection - I made little research into the comets anticipating that excellent preparation would protect against almost any risk. I should have invested more time into research of the comets as preparation is required in risk management, however, it is important to understand as best as possible what it is you're preparing for. The preparation for risk meant that the development of the community was slowed, however, when risk was prevented community development was able to continue unabated. 2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I played the game more than once. After several trials I ended up reducing investment in the raising of the plateau and putting more research into the comets. Once I had achieved the goal score for the level, that is when i invested more into the plateau.The main thing I learned from the game is that whilst a balance must be struck between prevention and anticipation of a risk, investing time into knowing and understanding more about the risks to be faced will enable available finances to be applied appropriately.3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The country in which I live has a democratic government with their constituents to consider - if I was to align the game closer with the community in which I live I would make every decision that the game player makes take several months or years to occur! Complacency and delay by Government or authoritative bodies can severely impact on actions taken in a community. This change would be reflected in the game as a time delay for each action taken - i.e add 4 seconds prior to building a housing unit to allow for the 'council review of planning application' and/or charge different amounts for the research of the comet depending on which government department is performing the research.",

            "reflection": "Risk management played several roles within the game.  The player needs to determine a balance of taking risk to develop the community against the uncertain external risks posed by comets/water damage.  From researching potential comet impact (knowledge), allocating wave protection costs and finally determining appropriate insurance coverage, the player must balance risks and opportunities according to available resources.  These choices force trade-offs between development, conservation of resources for insurance and rebuilding while providing protection and information gathering.  Preparation played a major role in managing risk and opportunity as purchasing insurance and mitigating comet risk were critical to moving forward in development and higher levels of achievement.  The roles of risk management were present in all aspects of the game and a key requirement of a player's success in managing development.  The game also showed that it is helpful to learn from experience to effectively mitigate risk while engaging opportunities.  \n\n\nAfter playing the game a couple times, it became apparent that while developing pods, it was critical to address incoming comets as these produce damage that consumes resources and time to recover.  It is especially necessary to allocate time to protecting against comet strikes while finding suiting timing to continue development of the community.  I learned that the elements of risk and opportunity needed to be balanced to ensure successful, sustainable development.  In particular, it was far more beneficial to address comet strikes as they occurred rather than attempt to rebuild and repair after strikes.  The time and cost needed to recover far exceeded the costs to prepare and address comets and flooding as they occurred.  Preparation was key to successfully navigating the development in the risk environment.  \n\n\nIf I were to propose any changes to the game in a new version, I think it would make sense to assign varying levels of risk to different development locations.  For example, properties located closer to the water would require increased risk tolerance, insurance and recovery costs.  Further, I would recommend differing insurance rates for different properties.  These suggestions would likely complicate the game's clear message of risk management but would perhaps mirror risk management in a manner more aligned with actual practice.  Overall, I think the game is a good representation of risk management and the functions of research, protection and insurance as they relate to development.  The concept works well as an interactive exercise to demonstrate these principles and their context in a simulated environment.",

            "reflection": "In the game, the role of risk management was to properly identify risks (comets), protect the assets (raise the altitude) and develop a prosperous society (accumulation of wealth to pass levels). Developing the assets as quickly as possible allowed the player to accumulate wealth at a much faster pace. By properly identifying the risks as soon as possible, the player was able to determine immediately if more research was to be performed or if the altitude needed to be raised accordingly. If done properly, the game could be completed without buying insurance once. Once a risk was identified, however, and if an appropriate amount of of research was performed, even the most severe comets could be mitigated with no damage. This would allow the player to continue developing his society with no setbacks. Additionally, if risks were properly mitigated, and insurance was not purchased, this allowed the player to continue allocating a greater share of his resources to develop the society.By playing the game a few times, I was able to quickly determine which comets needed more research. I learned that identifying and researching risks before they become an issue, I could forgo insurance. This allowed me to proactively develop the society, rather than react to damage caused by the comets. Additionally, once I had achieved the required level of development for each level, I would spend the remaining time and money -- comets permitting -- on raising the altitude of my city. This allowed me to start each level at a generous amount of money (accumulation outpaced protection level increments) and at a much higher level of protection, affording me the ability to spend time researching risks and developing my society as soon as I had enough money for each upgrade. I ran pretty thin levels of wealth in order to beat the game, but did so without insurance because I spent most of my time mitigating risks.If I were tasked with changing the game, I would allow the player the option of various levels of research and protection (altitude) instead of various levels of insurance. Because the game may be beat without insurance -- and because most insurance is full coverage -- I would like to give the player the ability to research comets at a quicker pace, but obviously at a higher cost, as well as the ability to increase protection at a quicker pace. In my opinion, this would be more realistic because with certain levels of wealth you can afford to throw more resources (people) at a problem. This is done so because higher levels of wealth allow for a better educated society, thereby affording the society the ability of tackling much larger, more complex issues.",

            "reflection": "\n\nRisk management was key to success in this game. The\ndevelopment was progressing in an environment that was prone to natural\ndisasters (strikes by comets). In this environment having an effective risk\nmanagement strategy was a must. The development involved costs in the initial phase\nthough it quickly started paying off. Similarly, risk management also involved\ncosts, but it paid off in terms of limited or no destruction from natural\ndisasters. There were three tools for risk management: research, insurance and\nprotection. Research revealed the probability and severity of strike. Insurance\nwas available in different levels and could be bought depending on the\navailable resources. Similarly, the amount of protection could be changed\ndepending upon the forecasted severity of strikes. Clearly, each of these\nchoices involved costs and involved setting aside resources that could have\nbeen used for development. In the immediate phase risk management seemed to\nimpede development by setting aside resources, but in a later phase risk\nmanagement seemed to have paid off when there were limited or no losses because\nof the adoption of a sound risk management strategy.\n\nI played the game more than once and I believe that my\nefficiency increased in subsequent trials of the game. For one, I was more\nwilling to adopt insurance despite the seemingly high costs. Further I was able\nto allocate resources properly by focussing on research. For example, if\nresearch showed that there was no possibility of strike, then I could divert\nresources from protection to development. Further I learnt time management e.g.\nI knew when to be on high level protection mode and when to be relatively at\nease. In short, I was better at deciding the trade offs.\n\nIf I were to design a new version of the game, I would\npropose an addition to the existing risk management system. I would introduce\nthe tool of institutional capability. Building this tool would involve\nresources and at the same time one key input of this tool would be a rating\ndenoting the way in which prior disasters have been handled. Thus institutional\ncapability would involve some fixed expenditure per unit time and may also\nprovide some resources at the onset of disaster. The rate of growth of\ninstitutional capacity should be linked to the cumulative scores of how\nprevious disasters have been handled. If a disaster has been handled badly\n(based on some loss parameter), the cumulative score would decrease. The\nobjective of adding this tool to the risk management mechanism is to reflect on\nthe collective and institutional learning curve.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Initially, I had plenty of trouble with the game. I tired many different methods but had trouble getting past the second level and only rarely, getting the bar high enough to reach level four. In this game, you have to manage risk while balancing it with development, much like in the real world. You can not spend all of your resources on protection or on research because then there will not be sufficient money, time, or other resources to build or upgrade the pods. In reality, you would be best off having ample insurance. During the game, I combined both high and low levels of insurance with more or less focus on other protective management tools in different game attempts. Ultimately, I discovered that the lower insurance policy was best because it is better to prevent, or developing ways to minimize effects of shocks, instead of having to deal with it afterwards. Concurrently, as the tutorial mentions, it is best to repair the pods immediately after the comets cause the damage. It is possible to succeed with the broader, more expensive insurance policy, but I did not find it effective because I would save more money by preparing for the damage. I tinkered with different amounts of research. Some times I was constantly doing research, which hindered my developmental efforts. A couple of times, I tried doing no research(which worked surprisingly well for the first couple of levels, as long as you have the highest insurance). One game, I immediately set all my efforts on raising the ground, but the protection was not enough for my underdeveloped civilization to thrive. On the other hand, disregarding the protection option is damaging especially with consecutive dangerous, comets.  I learned that there is not just one answer to risk management, but none of the choices are perfect. There are extreme sacrifices and a balance is difficult but necessary to find. This is obviously a simplified version, but I came into the game thinking that knowledge and trying to prevent disasters were enough, but problems will still occur and you will have to deal with the repercussions regardless. Developing the civilization was a hard task as well. If we were given an already civilized territory where we had money and resources in which to develop risk management, it would have been much easier. This is why there is a correlation between GDP and preventive measures in the international community.The game is too much of a trial and error. The game ends if you make one mistake early of even if you just get unlucky with a couple of disastrous comets back to back. The game would be more realistic if the player was only allowed one chance but the civilization is on a larger scale. One mistake would not be game ending and you could more easily see how the choices you make, the costs of opportunities you choose to pursue, effect the community. ",

            "reflection": "The game was a pure Risk management game. The game teaches how a risk is managed in  time of problem,uncertainty. As the future is uncertain so risk is unavoidable. What we have to do is reduce the risk to as minimum as possible because risk can only be reduced, it cannot be completely avoided. The main things to manage in the game were :1) Wealth,2) Insurance,3) Development meter,4) Timing,5) Up gradation,6) Risk evaluation ( Severity of the meteors , Probability of hitting by the meteors)7) Research, and 8) Community connections.A good choice of all these factors help in protection and thus help in development of an economy. I played the game multiple times and improved over each and every chance. Some of the learnings are:1) Insurance play the most important role. Insurance plays an important role in planning, leading, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the activities of Community both before a loss occurs ( pre-loss actions) and after a loss occurs (post loss) in an effort to minimize the adverse effects on Community at a reasonable cost.2) Wealth is to be used judicially.3) Research always pays.4) A switch in time saves nine.5) Connections among community are very important.The improvement in the game in the form of things which, I see, can reduce the probability of risk or can help in reducing it and help in coping risk in a better way are :1) More of wealth. Even if seen in a real world, wealthy economies can tackle risk in a better way because of the larger amount of resources available.2) Cheap insurance.3) Easy up gradation.",

            "reflection": "      Risk management played a very crucial role in ensuring that the planet can grow and prosper without the fear of damage. At the starting of the first level itself, I bought the 75% insurance cover. As I built my pods, I kept an eye on the comets (research) and increased my protection to match the severity of the potential disaster. Also, the research helped give me more time to create community connections. Due to these reasons, none of my pods suffered any damage during all 4 levels of the game I played. The resources spent on preparation helped me to utilize all the remaining money for development without having to save money to spend on repairing. Although initially I invested in heavy insurance and protection, it eventually paid off and despite curbing my ability to grow in the immediate future, I was able to then develop better ahead.       After playing the game, I realized why it is so important to manage risk well. I came to know that when you take the necessary precautions and have a safety net, you are able to develop better and jump higher, without fear of failing. While playing again, I realized that there is no one common solution, as every time, there are different situations. Every choice requires a trade-off between available resources and the other possible choices. Due to achieving a proper balance between knowledge, insurance and protection, I was able to optimally utilize my resources, protect my planet and utilize existing opportunities to continue to ensure its development.        I think the concept of financial risk is something that is important in today’s age, along with natural disasters and other concerns. I’d like to add a more finance-related component, such as the ability to take loans (at a margin of current development) and make deposits in case of excess funds (the term being a few seconds upto a few minutes) and different rates of interest on the same. I think that added complexity would bring the game closer to the one we play in our daily lives.Overall, the game helps practically apply the concepts we'be been studying in the past two weeks (risk management using knowledge, insurance and protection), and thus understand how to make decisions to manage risks more effectively, and achieve our goal of development.",

In every situation the impact of any risk can be amplified or reduced depending on what my decisions are talking about the money, the research (internal conditions), meteorits (external enviroment) in order to succeed in risk managment and get positives results.The choices I made and the trade-offs I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance were the constant decisions of doing research or not, buying inssurance, investing in upgrading the pods etc.The  preparation for risk affect development in many ways, for instance if I decided to buy insurance and a meteorit hit the reparations will be so cheap so I could have enough money to do it.I played the game a couple of times and  I did many things differently for instance I do more research the second time, I made more conections between the people in order to diminish the damage when a meteorit hit.Risk managment is effective when it combine capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards; preparation includes knowledge, getting information on risk (I do research on the asteroids) but then using that information to make judgments (I decide if purchase or not inssurance), obtaining protection (with inssurance, rising the pods, making conections with people around), mesures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, mesures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times.The main things I learned from the game were that every resourse  was important in different measures but a combination of all were the best option to risk management effectively and succesfully.",

            "reflection": "1. In this game we found all the notions around risk management, with the knowledge (staying on the meteor to see how the risk evolves), the protection (with the bar) and the insurance (which we had to buy). All of them have a cost in time (knowledge) and in money (the 2 others). The trade-off actually consisted in how to balance all of these factors in order to limit the damages and to have to spend less money to cope at the end, and in the meantime continue to develop (which is the optimal goal). So basically, the question was : should i spend more money in protection and insurance, and not develop enough my economy, or should i develop it as fast as possible but then face huge risks without protection. Then, the problem actually consists in how balancing protection and insurance, and in the meantime observe the meteors to obtain a more precise idea of the risk, but being unable to prepare for the possible crash.2. At the beginning, i basically didnt know how to balance everything, and i didnt know what to expect from the danger of the meteor. I spent most of my money in protection and lost it because of a slow development. I then tried to balance it a bit more effectively, but i still have the tendency to spend more money in insurance and protection. I was basically fearing big damages, so i tend to buy the most expensive assurance, even if i could play some levels without any crash at all.3. We could definitely implement some other concepts of the risk management, for example with the obstacles. The knowledge is already developped, the more time we spend looking at the meteor, the more pricise it gets. But we could definitely consider implementing the environment, with for exemple others nations all playing together, and thus design a collaborative game. Some actions could  be taken together, they probably would have a larger impact than the individual ones. Then, each decision would have an impact on the other countries, such as the price of repairing when there is already limited ressources. Another idea would be to develop other risks, and also other possibilities, such as moving to a less risky environment, or moving to a more risky but also more profitable. They are actually many choices, but it becomes then technically too difficult to play ...",

            "reflection": "The game Risk Horizon, provided a simple interpretations\nof the choices and opportunities faced by those managing risk. While playing\nthe game I was able to make use of all three aspects of preparation –\nprotection, knowledge and buying insurance and to use the community as a coping\ntool once a comet had hit. I was also able to increase my earnings and my\nability to pay for protection measures later the game.\n\nThe game was quite simple but demonstrated\nthat rarely is risk management perfect, there are choices to be made, significantly\nbased on resources. My ability to implement protection (raising the land level)\nand buy insurance was based on my finances which in turn were based on my\nplanets financial resources (the number and level of sophistication of my pods).\nI often had to make a call as to whether to invest in protection or to buy\ninsurance, or to upgrade my pods, reducing my current finances but increasing my\nresources for the future.  As the game progressed\nI learned that ‘perfect’ was rarely needed in order to get through and make it\nto the next stage – rather you had to make the most of the resources at your\ndisposal and what you know about the extent of the risk. A good level of risk\nmanagement was possible without having a full a gold plated solution. \n\nThe trade offs in the game reflected those\nfaced in real life by people, communities, government and the international\ncommunity. Choices have to be made when resources are limited, as to whether to\nput limited funds into insurance (and the extent of it), protection – such as\nflood defences, or stronger buildings or into taking opportunities that enable\nbetter risk management in the future - schooling or a new business. The impact\nof an incident on protection levels (decreasing them) also reflected the impact\nof real disasters on existing protection measures such as infrastructure and\nservices.\n\nKnowledge and coping strategies were\nslightly different in the game to protection and insurance as, as in real life,\nthey are less dependent on resources. Gaining knowledge in the game did take me\naway from efforts to improve protection and insurance, but were not as\nfinancially dependent. In real life, knowledge can also be spread relatively\ncheaply through open access to information and both community networks and technologies such as the internet\nand social media.  \n\nCoping similarly did not appear to be dependent\non my finances but made a significant difference in the impact of events when\nthey happened, reflecting the importance of strong community networks for those\nfaced with risks and opportunities. Living in New Zealand, the importance of\nthis was shown in the aftermath of recent earthquakes where community spirit\nplayed a significant role in sharing resources such as housing and providing psychological\nsupport after the event. This is an element of risk management that has\nmultiple benefits not just improving people’s ability to cope in a risk management\ncontext.\n\nI think the key element I would change in\nthe game is to increase the variety of risks, opportunities and preparation\nmeasures available. The differing strength of comets did reflect this to an\nextent, but if more variety were provided it would better reflect variety of\nrisks and opportunities faced by individuals and communities and the variety of\npreparation tools available. Rarely are people just facing ‘comets’ coming from\njust one direction with the same preparation methods required or a small number\nof trade off to be considered. ",

            "reflection": "This game was about development in the the time of uncertainty. Development of a settlement was challenging because of constant threats from the meteorites and damages they cause through I assume floods and earthquakes. The game is in line with the real world, where development of societies in hindered by natural disasters. It reminds me of an example given in one of the videos of week 2, where speaker talks about Mumbai and constant floods and also mentions Haiti earthquake. Our role in this game was to become \"Chile\", to make development possible even when the disaster strikes. This could have been achieved through buying insurance or raising the ground of the settlement as a way of protection. In my opinion, research we had to conduct about the meteorites was also the way of protection because it enabled us to better know our threat and prepare for coping with it. To achieve that we had make certain trade-offs. Most notable ones are tradeoffs in resources, where to allocate them, and in time, how to use it. When it comes to resources, we could have build or protect ourselves. The tradeoffs I made were based on the information I got from the research of meteorites. Depending on their severity and a change of impact I made a decisions either to buy an insurance or to protect the settlement. Here I noted that in case of great severity of the damage meteorite will cause and in times when this impact was certain, the best way to protect yourself was to build a protection. However, this approach took me time and resources I could have spent on a development. That is why in my second attempt I tried to balance between protection and an insurance, in a way that I was trying to get protected just enough to stay safe from the mediocre dangers that will cause me small damages, which are easy to repair and will not take a lot of time to repair. But, at the end I did make a mistake, where I allowed too much of damage that took me a lot of time and resources to cope with, and eventually cost me progress to finishing the game. To summarise my finding, I learned that investing too much on a protection and insurance will cost me a lot in terms of development, but not investing at all would not allow development to occur at all. The right approach would be to find a resource and time balance between protection/insurance and development, and that could be achieved only with the right amount of knowledge. The game actually did show this value of knowledge through this game of connection of green dots after the impact, and it proved that more research leads to better protection.In conclusion, this game shows the challenges people face in a real life and is a offers a good basis for understanding risk management that will lead to opportunities. I believe that this game could improve if developers would add unexpected events in a way of a third party help in terms of resources, or the event that might also slow down our development. This would better simulate the real world, where this unexpected events do occur and are usually very significant. Good examples would be change of political parties or sudden donations/help from let say Red Cross or United Nations. ",

            "reflection": "The main components of the risk management concept from the\ncourse were very well presented in the game: the knowledge about the coming\nrisk and the parameters of the comets, the options for insurance and\nprotection, as well as coping with the effects by creating connections within\nthe community. I chose to spend my resources on insurance, research and\nupgrading my pods and it proved to be a good combination of investments. Preparation\nfor risk helped in reducing the damage and thus creating better conditions for\ndevelopment. I think the positive effects were noticed immediately in the\naftermath of the incident of comets hitting the ground when one did not need to\nspend too many efforts and resources in recovery and rebuilding the community.The first time I played the game, I did not spend time doing\nthe research, so I failed very quickly. Subsequently, it proved to be a\npowerful tool for preparation and helped me in my next trials. I also spent my available\nresources on regular insurance at each level and constant upgrades of the pods.\nWhat I learned from the game, is that finding the best option to balance your\nresources and the necessary level of protection is a difficult task. Protection\nand insurance come at a price and connecting the community is another way to\nincrease resilience within the group. I also learned that confronting the risk is\ninevitable, but if enough efforts are spent for preparation, coping with the\naftermath effects could be a feasible task.\n\n\n\nIf I could propose a change in the game, it would probably be to diversify the risk – instead of having the constant risk of the comets\nperhaps presenting a dual risk could be more realistic. I believe that a good\noption could be introducing droughts and floods as potential risks to the community. In\nthat way, one has to make different choices depending on the expected risk and its\neffects. Unfortunately, these risks are also very present in the last decades in\nall the continents and cannot be ignored anymore. ",

            "reflection": "What\n was the role of risk management in the game?The role of risk management in the game was to prepare for meteors, and cope/recover when they did hit. This was acheived through raising the ground (protection), purchasing insurance to offset the cost of prepare (insurance), and researching the comets to determine risk (research).What choices did you make \nand what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, \nand insurance?I often had to decide between expansion and protection/insurance. I could either spend my money on expanding my buildings or try to protect or get insurance for them.In what ways did preparation for risk affect development \n(immediately, or after some time)?I was able to recover much more quickly after disaster, and in some cases I was even able to avoid damage at all. This however was at the cost of slowed development while preparing for risk. My overall speed of development did increase when preparing for risk, because there was significantly less \"lag time\" when trying to recover after a disaster.If you played the game more than \nonce, what did you do differently after the first time?At first I was overly cautious and bought too much insurance and spent too much time on protection. As a result I had little development in my buildings and was unable to meet each level's goal. The next time I played I tried to balance risk preparation and development in order to safely meet goals. This worked much more effectively and allowed me to pass the first few levels.What were the \nmain things you learned from the game?I learned that risk management is not always so simple. You have to balance risk and growth if you want to survive because neither can work on their own. In addition the best way to confront risk can vary and there is never one clear cut solution. The\n game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. \nImagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which \nallows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you \npropose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in \nthe place you live?The ability to move location to another part of the planet would be a nice addition. This would cost money but allow for different amounts of comets to hit.  This \"immigration\" would be risky because you might end up in an area that is more difficult to live than the original, but it would also have a good chance of being able to provide more protection or less comets.",

            "reflection": "Basically this game is very interesting. Interesting because there are many things we can learn together. I really like this game. This game makes me more and more to like about management risk and want to learn how to create an opportunity into success. Management of risk in this game has a very important role. We can make a priority that can be done when idle to face disruption or disaster. Of the three elements that can be used, namely knowledge, protection, and insurance I could make a priority to minimize the negative impact of the disaster. The first time I did was make a purchase insurance. Why purchase insurance? It is very clear that when the disaster came, to fix everything needed funds. If there are things that can be covered by insurance, it would be useful to reduce the cost at the time of repair. Then protection. It is also important to be able to minimize that when a disaster or disruption coming, the negative effects can be minimized. Even its exposure to the public that there are, in this form of protection is to reduce the negative effects that appear not to eliminate the negative impact. And the protection afforded should be is the best protection, so that people there can be a safe, quiet and alert when the catastrophe came. I played this game a few times. which is different in each game is a strategy that I do to try to get the best results. The best results in question is how to reduce the negative impact of the disaster. and eating six pieces I managed to reduce the negative impact of the disaster. Maybe at first I did trial and error to get the best possible way so that the best results can be obtained, which is to minimize the impact negetif. I need some time in order to get the results I want. When we can get the best way, we can perform a standard operating procedure so that when disaster came, we've been able to act in accordance with what will happen next. Whether it is a difficult thing? It must be hard, we may now talking at the level of the game. But when it's there and it actually happens will be very difficult. But no matter what happens we must be ready. I forgot about the research. research is also an important thing that must be done. With the research we will be able to gauge what will happen and how to best response. When compared with the state of current reality, especially with the situation that I experienced in Jakarta. Maybe if I was given the opportunity to provide input to the games we play, I want to add a feature there is the death toll from the disaster-affected or the disorder. In addition I also mlihat that these games can be made if we become governor where there will be a number of casualties, so that the governor's reputation as a person who plays the game can become a better feel for the situation that occurs when the disaster came. When a game can be made more complicated maybe we can get a lot insght that we can get about the risks and opportunities when disaster strikes. please note it is a disaster in my country are common. Almost in every year in Jakarta always get flooded. I feel concern for jakarta if the rains come. Therefore I always prepare mentally and logistical preparation if the floods come to jakarta. I have to do is buy a lot of instant noodles, took the money in the bank, and move goods to higher ground.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game is that it helped me plan for unforeseen damage the comet could cause to the community development using different level of protection, insurance and knowledge. It also make me understand that in planning for risk, one has to incur some cost or resources (cost for insurance, time spent on protection and acquiring knowledge). Risk management involves undertaking certain level of risk (because you are not sure of the outcome of your action) to achieve success. But this does not guarantee a hundred percentage at times.In developing the community, there are few choices made like purchasing insurance, or increasing your level of protection. All of these depend on the severity of the hit which can be detected or known by clicking on the exact comet  moving towards the earth at a particular time. Click on the comet to check the chances of hit and the severity of the hit. Each of this has 10 bars before it. Checking this bar help determine the level of preparation to make in order to counter or manage the amount of damage that can be caused by the comet. For example, if the severity of hit is high maybe on scale 6-7 and chances of hit is also high on scale 6, it is best to purchase insurance for the pods already developed and also increase the level of protection to a scale higher than that of the severity of hit by one (1). The logic is done by always making your level of protection higher than the level of severity of hit. You can also upgrade your pods.I played the game more than once. I actually started by developing the plot of lands, purchasing insurance and neglecting the fact that I had to increase the level of protection. And when the comet struck the pods were destroyed which shouldn't or couldn't have happened if I had increased the level of protection. Although, the cost of repair was reduced due to the insurance purchased earlier. The second time I played, I tried developing the land, increasing the level of protection to commensurate with the severity of hit and sometimes even higher depending on the chances of hit and it really worked well. But when the severity of hit and chances of hit are high, I had to purchase insurance to cover up for any damage and also increased the level of protection. The lesson learnt here is that to manage risk you have to combine different resources (knowledge, insurance and protection) not just depending on one say insurance alone.If I had to propose a better risk management that matter in the place I live, it will be against flood. In the area that I live presently, houses are built without proper layout and drainage system. Whenever it rains, the road gets flooded easily and this has in turn led to the gradual degradation of the roads in which the residents are incognisant of.  And most of the time when there is a heavy downpour water floods the houses and not only the road as earlier said. I have planned to schedule a risk management plan meeting with the resident association to carry out plans to mitigate against any future re-occurrence of  flood in the area. Plans include contributing as a community towards constructing good drainage system or making it compulsory for every resident to construct a drainage system in front of their houses.",

            "reflection": "In Risk Horizon, I had to balance the the costs of comet strikes with the benefits of developing my pods.If I spent too much on prevention, I would not have enough money to develop my pods and complete the game. However, if I did not spend enough, I would end up spending more money on repairs anyway. Research on the comets was another trade-off, as I could not do anything while undergoing research, yet doing the research meant I could afford to spend a bit less on raising the platform.The final trade-off was insurance. If I was going to protect my pods to a large extent, investing in insurance wasn’t worth it. However, if I was willing to let my pods get damaged a bit, I could save a lot of money by buying insurance instead of raising my landDirect preparation for risk - in the form of raising the pods - retards development, as it consumes money and time that could have been spent developing the pods. It is also an opportunity cost in terms of responding to the most immediate threat, researching the incoming comet. However, the benefits of appropriate - and not excessive - preparation saves a lot of money as well, in the form of money saved on repairs.If I were to play the game again, I would probably spend less over-preparing for comet strikes, as it consumed a lot of time and money. Spending more time researching the comet would have given me equal results. My money management improved as I played through the levels, as I was more familiar with the costs of each action, and the frequency of strong comets. Additional knowledge and experience allows me to make more informed choices with regards to the probability of an event occurring, and allows me to prepare accordingly.If I could add a feature, I would include a record of all past comets that summarises the frequency of different strengths of comets for even 2-minute interval that is updated with every comet that passes the planet, so that the player can make also choices based on historical data and past trends.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was to need to balance the three parts of protection,knowledge and insurance. The lack of experience in comet knowledge caused the protection decision hard to make.  To improve the protection leads to shortage of cash, the shortage of cash makes the development slow down,the growth slow down also.The insurance can claim the loss but the damage can cause the development slow down. Prepare for the risk need to buy reasonable premium insurance, but the shortage of risk knowledge makes insurance premium choose difficultly.If I played the game only once, I would buy higher insurance.If I can play more than once, I will reaserch the comets first.During the early game period,I focused on higher insurance to hope less cash to claim the damaged. After I recognized the protection is the main job to help the development as well, I started to balance the development, insurance and protection. What I learnt from the game was that any kind of risk can cause the development slow down whatever level insurance I bought. Development is the first, then protection job,then insurance cover.In the game captures,I have no ideas about game developing. ",

            "reflection": "I played the Risk Horizon games four times. The first three times, I did not make it to the second level... on the fourth try, I passed level 1 and failed level 2.Each time, I purchased the maximum insurance plan, and used the rest of my funds to build developments. I researched the incoming meteors -but did not allocate resources towards protection. I definitely underestimated the importance of \"protection\" and I ended using lots of funds to cover damages. Even though the premium insurance plan that I purchased covered most of the costs, once I had multiple expensive developments... even with the supplemental 75% from insurance, it was still very costly to rebuild.For me, the simulation certainly demonstrated the equal importance of knowledge, protection and insurance. I feel that I focused heavily on coping with loss --but did not do enough to prevent the loss from ever happening in the first place.I read through the instructions twice before starting the game --but still felt that it took the first two simulations before I really grasped the concepts and objectives. If I designed a second version of the game, I would reconfigure the threat. The meteors hitting the ocean causing rising water seems like an indirect threat... why not have meteors heading directly for the village? The information, research, and severity would certainly be more practical to the average user. Overall, I would prefer the game be structured around an idea of \"development\" that is less vague. Seeing the grass grow on the island.. and watching the meter on the left side of the screen felt very ambiguous. I like the idea of building roads or bridges in a town or city, and watching structures arise out of the increased capacity for commercial development.",

By learning their intensity\nand severity of hit, I could better plan in advance towards protection and\ninsuring.\n\nTime and money was also an\nissue as one has a limited period of time to make decisions and\nlimited amount of money, having to make choices between buying a\nbetter insurance or upgrading the development, whilst still looking at protection. Decisions were taken gradualy, analysing potential risk.Each meteor had its own characteristics in terms of hitting and causing potential damage. It is necessary to observe history of possible damage in case of being struck by a meteor.\n\nBy preparing for risk,\ninvesting on protection, research as well as purchasing insurance which became more\nand more expensive as the game progressed, development was affected moneywise as not enough funds were left for development immediately. Upgrades\ngradually took longer and longer to be completed besides more expensive.In addition to financial resources, time management also played an important issue, as many decisions would have to be taken simultaneously.\n\nI played the game more than\nonce. When I played for the first time I focused on development and protection and ignored\nresearch. So after the first game, I invested more on research and tried to balance out my\nchoices more prudently so to have protection and development evolving along\nside.\n\nThe main thing that I learnt\nfrom the game was that knowledge is crucial for development. Knowledge on meteros helped me to prioritize on protection, or upgrade whilst not losing focuns on development.\n\nBy investing in knowledge,\nyou are investing in development and tackling any potential disruptions such as\npotential meteor catastrophe.\n\nI would add the drought\nelement along with pest growth, which is seasonal where I live, however it is\nresponsible for causing destruction, death and seriously affecting crops, which therefore results in food price increase if there is a shortage.In this case, when\ndry season comes it is necessary to have a good irrigation system as well as\ngood pesticidas to fight against pests. In this case, investing on technology should be enough to upgrade the irrigation system, however research on crop pests would be required to to find out what the best pesticide is. It is known that pests grow stronger with pesticides so constant investment would be required. \n\n \n\n ",

I had read and re read again and again the tutorial, and played using all the available tools interchangeable, but still could not pass level 2. Hence, I only get 5 % for this game segment in week 2. I really am dissatisfied with this particular game, and can say that I still cannot understand it.I am sorry, because I want to do well in this course. Last week quiz I got 15 out of 15, so I do not think that I should disappoint myself this week.Anyway, I hope there will be a better risk game in the future, if you choose to include any game in this course.Thank you.

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to make a balance between risk preparation and developing a community in Alora. As the leader of the community I had to make decisions, I had to economize the usage of the community's resources between researches, protection and insurance. In my opinion the main purpose was to make choices under uncertainity and optimise the usage of resources to protect the city.I had to make choices and compromises because in each round I had limited time to achieve all the goals (develop the community, do researches, build protection). Every action costs money and time - which is really a rare resource in this game. On the basis of my reasearch I gaind information about the severity of the meteors and checked my protection level. In case I realized that my level of protection is not enough I had to stop doing researches earlier. I bought insurance in every round so that I had the opportunity to make a lot of community connections when my community was hit by a meteor.Preparation for risk affected the development of my community immediately when I had only a little money which I spent for Insurance. I had to wait and collect more resources to spend some money on protection or on development. Building protection always made my pods stop developing. I'm not sure but I think that making the more research made the pods develop faster.After I played the game once I decided that during the next games I'm goning to buy insurance and balance more carefully between recearch ang protection. I tried to develop only some of the pods and leave the others on a basic level, but in this cases the development level was not enough. I learned that it is important to develop your community balanced and equally to reach a healthy level of development. It was important to have protection too, beacause without protection the community got damaged and I lost some time while re-building the pods. Research is important but it is impossible to monitor all meteors on the highest level, in case I had 6 or 7 meteors I checked all of them and monitored (researched) the more sever for a longer time.If I had the opportunity to add something I'd like to add a more specific feedback at the end og the levels. For example in one of my games I got really severe meteors, so I decided (after buying the average insurance) to buy the highest level insurance too. And at the end, after loosing the level I got the message that \"If you would like to protetct the community you should buy insurance\". Sometimes it is annoying and not helping the player to understand what was wrong or not good enough.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game was to help mitigate risks and provide opportunities for development. The way I happened to play the game was to spend most of the resources on insurance and the development of pods. The reason behind this was to advance the cause of development in order to reach the goals. I used whatever money remained was used for last minute protection, as any very strong comets arrived. The immediate impacts of preparation for risk were to slow down development due to a lack of resources; on the other hand, preparation for risk in the long run actually improved development because fewer resources were used to fix damaged pods, thus speeding up development. The first time I played the game was a bit of a disaster; I was not aware of how to develop the pods. After going over the instructions, I was able to work on developing the pods, I also made sure to have a good balance of insurance and protection. I think I ought to have used research more. I learned about the balance required in risk management between insurance, protection, and research in order to mitigate risks as much as possible; I also learned how effective risk management could help promote development. The final thing I learned dealt specifically with protection, and how protection in certain circumstances could actually slow growth; this, I believe, was specifically referring to environmental protection, and how in the short term it can hamper growth and development. If I were to make an addition to the game, I would have liked to include an aspect of private enterprise. As someone from the United States, private enterprise plays a key role in certain aspects of risk management. I would like to see how private enterprises could aid in development by building pods of their own, and I would like to see how private enterprise can actually cause problems when it comes to risk management due to misallocation of resources and the withholding of information. \n",

            "reflection": "Playing this game was\nvery challenging. The instructions were not precise enough. At first, I did not\nunderstand the risk management aspect; I was too busy trying to understand the\ngame itself. But after numerous tries, I was able to have a better\nunderstanding of the risk management aspect that was presented. The role of\nrisk management in this game was presented through the different options\navailable towards one single goal, a sustainable development. The latter was characterized\nby combination of knowledge, growth, protection and insurance. It was important\nto find the right combinations to ensure a continuous growth of the community\nafter the different obstacles.\n\nAt first glance, it\nseemed obvious for me to increase the protection, in order to nuance the\nimpacts and prepare for the next comets. However, I quickly understood that it\nwas not an effective long term solution. Trade-offs was highly important. My strategy\nwas to start by building the community (three at a time), then add an insurance\nto lower the cost in case of an impact, and finally raised the protection.  Preparation for risk, as it was presented in\nthe videos, included different factors such as knowledge, insurance and\nprotection. \n\nIf I had played the\ngame only once, I would have start paying attending to all the other options.\nIt is easier to just focus on the obvious option (which was enlarging the\ncommunity) than to think outside the box and incorporate all the possible\nfactors that have an impact on the final result.  On the other side, if I had played more than\nonce I would have strategically combined all options. Combine the option also\nrequires a precise timing. I had a very difficult time, understanding when to\nact and when not to act.  But overall, I\nlearned that different factors get involve to produce growth and I also learned\nthat community support is majorly important. Resources, as we might thing, are\nnot always the only problem; therefore as a risk management agent, I should\nlook more closely in all factors. \n\nIt was a good game;\nthey were able to present a close version of a community struggling for\neconomic growth. However I have some recommendations. First, to have a more\ndetailed instruction on how to play the game; then to explain how the community\nsupports work and allow the support to happen even before the shocks and\nfinally to allow the community to be relocated(far from the border) as a\npreventive action.  ",

            "reflection": "I tried various configurations of balances between development, protection and insurance based on  research, severity and likelihood of impacts from meteors. It was easy for level one to three but became progressively more difficult moving up levels. I tried high levels of insurance, mid level of protection in order to keep production on schedule. In some cases it worked. Research was the weak point. A high degree of likelihood for impact could sometimes result on no impact at all. In essence, there was two sets of ratios to manage. One was the information on the meteors, the other was development on the planet. Other factors were the variable rates of speeds of the meteors related to speed of development at each level.  I would imagine a back ground in science and math would be of benefit in this game. I did determine that high cost of insurance and protection slowed production at higher levels. on top of that shocks and the severity of shocks were more frequent. The clock gave no mercy. development needed to happen at a rapid pace in order to generate capitol to protect and insure. On the positive side, I did manage to synchronize the variables in order to save the development from destruction many times. In essence, I was looking to set the safety parameters and progress with production with out a lot of recalibrating. But that did not work all the time. In some cases I fell into reacting to what turn out to be a poor plan from the start. In cases I won and lost.Defining risk and its severity of negative outcome under very narrow time constraints combines with calibrating the tools of development, protection and insurance was my biggest challenge. I guess that is the name of the game.If I were to change the game, I would increase the knowledge or research aspect of the meteors. Out of a value of ten most research never went beyond one or two. So it would appear to me, the weakness that that I had as leader, was 'knowing what was coming down the pipe.' Perhaps that is a luxury that does not happen in many cases with natural of financial shocks for example. So better planning at the protection and insurance phases are necessary. This would shift my focus now to having abetter understanding of calibrating insurance, protection and development all against time constraints.In my community, in 2013, we had the most expensive natural disaster in Canada's history. It was a once in 200 year flood. A freak, very heavy, two day down pour dropped it's load over our community catching weather forecasters by surprise. Which is interesting considering the high level of technology and knowledge of weather forecasting today. The other aspect that caught the city off guard was flood mitigation infrastructure. Drastically ill prepared. A lot of that has changed and is in the process of change. Massive efforts and investment are underway. But, if I could suggest one change to implement, that would be to challenge people's fascination and romance of living close to rivers that have histories of flooding for millennia. In centuries past, rivers were vital for transportation, food and life itself. So having close access was vital. Indigenous populations were migratory and could pack up and move at a moments notice when flooding was near. European settlers chose permanent structures. Now we still live next to these dynamic and powerful hydraulic systems called rivers and fail to build houses with insufficient flood mitigation technology. Year after year, decade after decade, home owners are always shocked that their properties are damaged by the latest flood. When choosing a home, it would appear that many people do not take topography, geology or geography into account and all of the natural components that interact with in these systems.",

            "reflection": "Answer to Q 1. Risk management defines the mechanism of confronting the risk, preparing for them and coping with the adverse affects. Here comets are like the shocks which affecting internal and external environment of the planet alora resulting in adverse outcome. With reference to the game the interlinked component of risk management pictured nicely with community development by building and developing pods, facilitating research regarding the severity of comets which pursues application of knowledge aided research thereby receiving more time to protect the community and providing 3 different insurance cover for the same.Lastly the benefit of risk management over weigh the cost of resources to cushion the development.In the game i choose all the 3 choices to proceed in the next level.Preparation of Risk affecting development is not for short term. It affect development immediately as protecting the planet alora from shocks but it should be envisaged further to harness the developmentAnswer to Q 2.I attempted the game twice. In first attempt, I failed in level 2 owing to not acquainted with the procedure of game. In first try i haven't take any insurance cover and moreover i haven't increase my protection against the severity of risk. But in second attempts i used all the interlinked components of risk management like developing and upgrading the pods, take insurance cover of 75% which incurred me less cost regarding reconstruction of pods, uplift the ground level more above the sea level so that the severity of risk cost less damage to my community and apply more research to each comets thereby getting more time to build and upgrade the community of alora.  More you uplift the ground and involved community development and up-gradation, more is your development of alora and with increased power to withstand the severity of risk. But the process of managing the risk comes with the cost of resources. With respect to cost benefit analysis the benefit of risk management is more than the cost incurred. Moreover protection helps to reduce the probability of the size of losses and increase the benefits. And lastly proper insurance cover helps to repair the pods thereby adjusting the cost against the severity of risk.Answer to Q 3.For further clarification of the choices of risk management I propose to introduce different insurance cover for different comets. And in terms of changes i want to adjust the level of severity with the increase of research. With pursuit of knowledge one can also prepare for the risk thereby in better position to cope with severity of risk. So more the knowledge and research will increase, less will be the affect of severity of comets hitting the ocean floor.",

            "reflection": "I-Risk management’s role and trade-offs:\n\nRisk management in RiskHorizon aimed at balancing\nallocation of resources between preparation to potential shocks  - protecting the Alora community against falling\ncomets that may hinder its development - and healthy development - by building\nand upgrading pods. To\nbe cost-effective, a comparison of the cost of an upfront intervention to the\npotential benefit should a shock occur, had to be weighed by the probability of\nthat shock occurring.\n\nWhen preparation for risk was poor, the\nconsequences of a materialized risk were costing time that could be used for other\nactions, and most importantly, allocation of assets that slowed down/decreased\ndevelopment. Preparation (research, protection,\ninsurance) on the other hand was also costly, while the benefits were not\nalways certain: \n\n1) Improving\nwarning systems (the severity and chance of hit) through research, not only\nhelped estimating benefits versus costs, but also increased the potentiality of\nbuilding community connections that drastically reduced post-impact\nconsequences. Focusing on comet research was free but took time, which\nsometimes could be used more effectively elsewhere.2) Protective tools\n(elevating the island) cost resources, and the time spent protecting Alora\ntemporarily slowed down its development.\n\n3) Moreover by obtaining\nan insurance plan, damaged pods were quicker and cheaper to rebuild. Purchasing\na more or less covering/expensive insurance depended on the community’s budget,\nits level of development, and the severity and chance of hit, which knowledge\nof was linked to the time spent on research.\n\nFinally, risk preparation in the\nshort-term negatively affected pods development, in the sense that fewer\nresources were allocated to their growth. In the long run however, risk management appeared\ncost-effective in many cases, and increased economic returns, by reducing the\nrisk and reparation costs altogether, leaving more resources available for investment in risk management and\ndevelopment. \n\n \n\nII- Learnings and changes of action:\n\nPlaying more than once, several changes and\nrealizations struck me: \n\nAfter several\ntrials, I decided to develop Alora more progressively, adapting the pods’\nupdate to their protection, as I realized this method was more cost-effective,\nbut also because the more were the pods updated, the more my resources\nincreased in a short period of time. \n\nSecondly I\ndedicated more time to research by focusing on the comets, as I had realized\nthat it gave me extra time to increase community connections, which would decrease/eliminate\nreparation costs in the event of an impact. \n\nFinally I\ndecided not to systematically purchase the most expensive insurance at every\nround, balancing this decision with other tools available (research/protection),\nand with the probability of the risk materializing. \n\nTo wrap-up, I\nhave learned to prioritize and choose between key parameters affecting\ncost-effectiveness,  as I became\nincreasingly aware of the necessity to provide a benchmark for the value of\naverted damage to Alora.  \n\n  \n\nIII- Development of a new game version\nand risk management: \n\nPreemptive\nmeasures in the game are adequate to Alora’s risks; however the symbolism of\nthe falling comets - if it were to happen where I live - would be a global\ncatastrophe, which is why I would find international cooperation to be of\nupmost importance.\n\nIn\nthe game, this would translate into introducing several cities/communities that\none does not necessarily see, but that you can trade knowledge, research, and\neconomic data with. For example, Alora could sell its research to other cities\nand vice versa against resources. This new tool would support the articulation\nof potential benefits and costs for improved decision-making. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was huge in the game. In fact, the game in all fairness is all about risk management. The game from the beginning to the end entailed all the components of risk management as explained during the lectures. The components of risk management include: Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping. I made made a number of choices and some of them include creating a healthy environment by accumulating the pods (development), which shows on the balance scale (left lower side of the screen) and preparing for the threats/attacks which are represented by the comets in the game. In terms of knowledge, protection and insurance, certain trade-offs were made. For example, while I was creating a healthy environment, I had to trade-off certain amount of dollars (resources) in other to ensure that the impact of the threats/damages is reduced to the affordable minimum through insurance. At other times, I ensured that knowledge was sought through research so that the impact of the potential threats (comets) was known before they actually took place. In this way, certain measures are put in place to ensure adequate protection. Preparation for risk affected development immediately it was done. This is because while preparing for risk, there is a little delay in the time that was meant for development to take place through the upgrade of the pods. Moreover, the resources that were used in preparing for risk also had some effects on the general development because they could be otherwise used for development. However, in the long run, they rate of recovery i.e. coping that was experienced made the impact of the threats/hits lesser and therefore allowed for quick recovery.Whenever I play the game again, I would ensure that more provisions are made for risk management. This is because in the game I played earlier on, I focused more on upgrading the pods (development) without adequate preparation for risk management. Needless to say, I didn't really purchase enough insurance to cater for the losses that may result from the hits/threats. Most times during the game, this happened as a result of underestimation of those threats (risk) and tendency to keep the money that should have been spent in the form of insurance. My efforts on protection by pressing and holding the key on the right lower corner of the screen was also not encourage, I swung into action for protection too late. When next I play the game, I would ensure timely protection, adequate preparation for the risks by carrying out research on the impact of the threats at hand and then continually develop my environment. In short, I would ensure adequate balancing between Knowledge, Protection and Insurance. Once this is done, greater rewards are gotten. While potential attacks are totally prevented or their effects are largely mitigated when they eventually happen, rapid development takes place in the community and the resources are therefore wisely invested without more focus on certain areas of management compared to the others..It's a very great game. Though simple, yet very tasking and informative. Supposing I'm saddled with the responsibility of changing one or two things about the game, I would possibly add vibration to the sound and this will happen immediately the threats i.e comets hit the water to indicate attack. In this way, the fear of an attack will make the game more engaging as the player would be much more conscious of attacks. This way, the game becomes more realistic and therefore creates a considerable psychological effects. With this, this game becomes more exciting and real than it is. A great game!",

            "reflection": "I\nplayed the game twice, but I couldn't get past level one. The object of\nthe game was that you had to build your buildings and watch out for\ncomets which could potentially damage your buildings. In order to\nprepare for risks you had to protect your buildings by raising your\ncity up and buying insurance in case damaged was taken. Because I\nonly had so much money, both times I played I sacrificed building so\nthat I could protect the couple of buildings I did have. You could\nresearch each comet to evaluate the threat, which helped some. But no\nsooner was I past a minor threat, when a bigger threat showed up. An\nactual hit put me back financially and slowed me down from being able\nto build more. The first time I played I felt that insurance that\noffered 50% coverage would suffice, but when more dangerous comets\nappeared I found I needed more insurance. I had four or five\nbuildings that time, but I lost really quickly. Only three of my\nbuildings were upgraded. The second time I played, I purchased the\n75% coverage right off the bat, but that then decreased my money\nright in the beginning. I could only build three buildings, and I\nthink I might have upgraded one. All this is done against a timer,\nwhich I pretty much negated, since I couldn't really survive the\ncomets, anyway. There's a specific balance needed in order to build\nyour city, as well as protect it, and then insure it on top of that.\nI think I could achieve that, but it will take another couple of\ntries. I think one change that could be made that would help the game\nbetter represent real life would be to take into account the\nindividual buildings. Currently in the game, if there was damage from\na comet, I could quickly just repair it before the next comet (I\ntried to always save money for repairs, if nothing else). With\nindividuals to take into account, there's then the possibility that\nthe people in one building wouldn't be able to make the necessary\nrepairs before the next comet. If previous comet damage, or any other\nunrelated expensive decision, left the family too broke that they\ncouldn't make the repairs in time, I could end up just losing my\nbuildings. In other words, make it so that I send the money for\nrepairs to the building, instead of just directly making repairs.\nThen, put in a time limit for how long it takes for a building to\nrepair. Some buildings will get repaired, but one or two will take\nlonger, and so you have to work harder to protect the town. This\nwould be an annoying change, however. Although I support people\nhaving their freedoms to make their own decisions, it would be really\nfrustrating if you had to sit their and watch people not be prepared\nfor a potential disaster, especially when you are trying everything\nyou can to protect them. ",

            "reflection": "Question 1:\n\nThe\nrole of the game was to showcase how preparation and development for risks\ninfluence each other. Risk\nmanagement had a primarily preventive role in the game – researching comets,\nelevating the ground, insuring potential damages.\n\n During\nthe game I noticed that I had a preference of the steps I could take to get\nthrough the game: I\nalways started off by elevating the ground in order to diminish the effects of\na potential comet impact. After that was done I worked on the development of\nthe houses. Only\nafter that I went to research the comets. I\nhardly used the insurance option, as insurance only helps with the aftermaths\nof a catastrophe, but doesn’t help with preventing it.\n\nPreparation\nfor risk (elevation, research and insurance) lead to having not enough time for\nmaking sufficient progress on the development scale. The\npreparations undertaken for risk prevention vanished after some time and had to\nbe invested in again – only development was stable and did not decrease again\nonce it was achieved.\n\n \n\nQuestion 2: \n\nI\ndid play the game a couple of times but was never able to finish it. Most of\nthe times I did get until level 6, but failed only a few steps on the\ndevelopment scale.\n\nI\nthink I even know where I made the mistake, but was never able to make it\ncompletely right: Because\nespecially during the last two levels it is highly important to not spend too\nmuch money on preparations but invest most of the money into developing the\nhouses – as all (?) houses need to be fully developed to successfully finish\nlevel 6. I\nalways wanted to be on the save side and kept the elevation of the ground high\n(first pink block) – but the increased number of comets in the last levels\ncaused the plateau height to decrease constantly and I invested too much money\ninto keeping it high.\n\nThe\ngame is all about finding a good balance between undertaking preparations for\npotential risks and developing the community.\n\n \n\nQuestion 3:\n\nWhen I\nstarted playing the game I thought that the houses that were closest built to\nthe ocean would face a higher risk of damage by floods. Hence I always started\nto build the houses on the right side of the plateau, furthest from the ocean.\nBut during the game I learned that that was an element that did not have any\ninfluence on the game. \n\nSo to make\nthe game more realistic, I would add the element of ‘proximity to water’ as an\nessential element to the game as it is also very relevant to risk management in\nreal life. ",

            "reflection": "\n\nMY GAME REFLECTION\n\n\nI can say that the main role of risk management for this game of Alora world was\nthe identification, analysis,\nassessment,\ncontrol,\nand avoidance,\nminimization, or elimination of unacceptable risks\n. Through this game I discovered how and why risk management is important for\nthe development of society or country. I learned by research, protection and\ninsurance how  to develop alora community to the best of my ability while\nmeeting milestones to comets threaten. but despite obstacles, I tried to fill\nmy development bqr by building and upgrading pods. and this procedure helped me\nto learn and undestand how to coordinate economical qpplication of resources to\nminimize, monitor and controle the probability and impact of unfornate natural\ndisasters.\nIn terms of knowledge, I reduced the chance of the comet hitting until the impact\nand I received more time of information to create community connections right\nbefore the comet hits: this method helped a lot to boost the protection. And in\nterms of protection; I pressed and hold  the slider, located on the bottom\nright of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.\nThrough this, I prevented the pods from being damaged by matching the level of\nprotection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider.\nfinally; in terms of the power of insurance; I prepared for high severity comet\nby buying a plan. I mean, by obtaining insurance, pods damaged from waves of\ncomets were quicker and cheapper rebuilt. this helped me to recover lost\ndevelopment.\nSo, for the most part, these methods consisted of identifying; characterizing\nthreats of Alora community, assessing the vulnerability of critial assets to\nspecific threats, identifying ways to reduce those risk and prioritizing risk\nreduction measures based on a strategy. \nAnd my choice was to build and upgrade more pods so that I might fill faster\nand increase the amount of wealth. this helped me to continue keeping the meter\ngreen by trying to reach my goal of passing another level.\nConcerning the trade-offs I confronted, I can say that it was not easy to beat\nthe level in the sense of reaching the indicated on this development meter\nbecause of the time and also I did not know how to reach the goal in time. \n\nTherefore, from\nthis game I learned following two elements:\n\n1.      After establishing the context, the\nnext step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risks\nare about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk\nidentification can start with the source of our problems and those of our\ncompetitors (benefit), or with the problem itself. Once risks have been\nidentified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact\nand to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to\nmeasure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for\nsure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring. \n\n2.      \nRisk management regarding natural disasters : It\nis important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods caused\nby comet like in Alora community, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk\nassessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, \nBut if they asket me to develop  a new\nversion of this game, I will increase more money of insurance and to introduce\npeople in building and upgrading pods. I will try to reduce level.\n\nIn summary, I can say that this game helped me a lot to\nunderstand in practice the risk management.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Understanding RM through the game was really a new experience for me. Although I understood the components of the RM, implementing them was quite hard for me. I have tried the game several times till I managed passing level one and then moving to level five. During the game , I faced some of the obstacles such as lack of resources, time and knowledge. At first I started by spending too much time protecting the village through raising it up which did not give me time to research or have money to build and develop. Then I tried concentrating on developing first and researching which still did not give me the chance to protect and prevent damages. Having too many comets attacking as well did not give me enough time to protect my village. Through my trials of the game, I learnt that even by gaining knowledge I still could not prevent the hitting of the comets , but I can lessen the damage or prevent it by buying the highest insurance rate. So, the first thing I did in the other trials was starting with the insurance package to be on the safe side. By this , coping with the shock was easier and less damage happened and sometimes none. At times, I had to make trade-offs by sometimes choosing not to spend too much time on protecting and rather spend it on researching. This helped me with money that gave me chance to build and develop more,but did not give me too much time as comets were increasing on numbers. At my last successful trial I understood better how to balance between my choices. So, I started by the insurance,then building two pods and increasing two levels of the island, then immediately researching to help lessen the damage which actually helped. Then again in building other new ones and continuing with other one level of raising and my researching after that. So, by balancing between each component I managed to succeed and reach level 5. I was very happy with the different choices I made and how better to balance through my choices for improvements.Regarding how to upgrade the game, I would like to present some suggestions. First, I have seen that through clicking on the research button, the comet window should keep opened and so nothing else could be done till the research be done. As in reality , one person won't be doing everything at the same time and so I suggest by just clicking on the comet, the researching will be done automatically without having keeping the window ,to give time to do other things as well. Second, to offer as an extra privilege protective shields to be built on the buildings as a means of protection in case of comets that could not be prevented but at the same time keep the buildings safe and better coping with the attack. Lastly,having other means of resources to get money from to help in the developing. In conclusion, the game was a challenge for me. It gave me an insight regarding the risk opportunities I needed to take. The more I spent time in my developing beside my research, it helped me more to protect my assets.It also taught me that not everything shock in our community could be prevented but by learning to how to cope and where to invest more helped in passing through the shock. And so by balancing between the components of knowledge,coping,insurance and protection was I was able to keep my community safe and so do better choices for the future.    ",

            "reflection": "Firstly, in the game, the role of risk management is very\nimportant. It decides the development of community, and how quickly a community\nrecovers after a disaster. \n\nSpecifically, in the game, I had to make choices to decide\nwhich one I should invest money on: the development of the village (build and\nupgrade more houses) or I should spend that money and time on the knowledge,\nprotection and insurance. If I build and upgrade more houses, I will have to\nwait until the wealth is enough to do other things such as buying a package of\ninsurance and raising the land higher, which means the investment on these\nthings will be lower compared to when I spend all of money  on these and neglecting the houses. Although\nthe preparation for risk affects the development, it is just a matter of\nshort-term view. It is true that the development will be stopped at the moment\nto leave the side for the protection, getting knowledge and insurance as the\nresult of the opportunity cost; but it does not mean that the development will\nbe ignored forever. All the protection plans and insurance are the way to make\nsure that the development of your community can last as long as it is possible.\nRemember that only a good preparation plan will assist the security so that\npeople can feel safe to work and develop. \n\nMoreover, I concluded this after I had played the game three\ntimes: I spent more time to do research on the comets and I became more aware\nof the sky, even though the sky was clear and lack of comets, when I was\nfocusing on building the village. Also, I tried to buy a full package of\ninsurance though it was expensive as if something takes place, I got more than\nwhat I paid. One thing I learn most in this game is that an accident/disaster\ncan happen any time and the severity can be different from the lightest to the\ntoughest. I should always have some backup plans before and after the bad\nthings happening to me. \n\nFinally, if I have a chance to add one thing in the game, I\nmay want to add the cost to the research on comets. I realize that when you\nresearched the comets, it didn’t cost anything except for the time. In fact, it\nshould have cost something, not much but we do need money to do a research in\nreal life and this will emphasize the trade-off between the development and\ngetting knowledge, protection and insurance. Furthermore, in Vietnam where I\ncome from, the importance of insurance is being neglected. People rather keep\ntheir money than using it to buy insurance. It mostly roots from the lack of\nknowledge about the severity when something bad takes place. It is not about\nthe money because even when they have money, they still don’t want to spend it\non the insurance. There should be program to educate people, to make them\nrealize that they definitely will spend more when an accident happens to them\nand/or the government can loan/support the families who cannot afford the insurance,\nespecially farmers. In the end, the neglected habit and lack of information are\nmain features of poverty and slow development. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "Every community is faced with threats and risks that may endanger the whole society. In some cases, the main problems are natural disasters, in other cases those are social disorders, fertility rates, economic collapses etc. In our game, where the main story is happening on the Alora planet, the main threat to the community are falling comets which can affect this community in many aspects, for example by causing floods. Thus, the role of risk management in this game is to struggle with those threats by making the adequate balance between available resources - research, protection and insurance.  If the right choices are made, the community becomes safer and lasts longer.At the beginning of the game, I put the main emphasis on the use of insurance. Therefore, most of my actions were pursuing insurance and relying on it. I thought that the most efficient way to protect the Alora was reduction of material costs of reparation after damage, without any serious engagement in protection and research. Unfortunately that was wrong. The only result of using resources in this manner was inability to compensate the damage after the accumulated shocks. Then I have changed my strategy and started to pay more attention to research and protection, with really low use of insurance. After that, the things have started to change. I researched a lot, and as a result of that I reduced severity and possibility of shocks. This means that we have to be familiar with characteristics of our environment and also with specifics of the threats our community is faced with. After a while, it was obvious that the most important aspect to focus on was protection. The protection is the main objective and all our efforts should be put towards reaching it. After I had raised protection bar to the highest level in combination with knowledge gained from researching, I just had to maintain the existing condition and to keep on upgrading pods. Thereby every effort to build strong protection was very valuable.By playing this game, I have learned that if you are not well prepared and if you don’t protect your objects adequately, you will probably lose a lot . Because, no matter how much money or insurance for repairing you have, if you let things be destroyed and just wait and hope that damage will not be devastating, you won’t be able to live any legacy behind you. We should not wait for things to happen. We have to be well informed about our environment - natural and social, and be prepared to meet their necessities and to try to develop and improve technologies for safer facing with the future. It is important to explore as many comets as possible and in this game I did not have enough time for all comets I wanted to explore. Thus, If I had the chance to add something to the game, it would probably be a possibility to research at least two comets at the same time. I think that would improve researching conditions and provide better results.",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon is rather a risk management tool that involves understanding  the opportunities for development and the means to grasp them, means to anticipate the risks that come in the face of comets in the game, the importance of investing in research so that there is enough knowledge about the nature and severity of the risk, the various preparation mechanisms like insurance and protection (raising the island as in the case of the game), and  finally , ways to cope with the risks effectively, so that damages can be minimized (by dragging the golden ovals to join them to each other). The aim of the game, which is to maximize development by minimizing damages due to potential risks, is very much in line with the goal of risk management.The latter as we all know is all about increasing the benefits and decreasing the losses that people experience when they face risk.\n\nOnce a risk or a comet was seen on the horizon, the first thing that was done, was gaining information about the potential of the risk. Next came the choice or rather the trade off between protection and insurance. Both were a must and were resorted to, much before a risk appeared, but the proportion in which each is to be used, greatly varied depending upon the severity of the risk.  Effective research and preparation for risks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment for future safety. Insurance not only means protection but also facilitates the necessary repair work, whenever there are damages. Apart from all this, effective coping mechanism (promptly joining all the golden ovals to each other once a comet was hit) greatly mitigated the possibility of any damage.It is important to bear in mind at all times that development is the prime concern.Developmental activities must go on at all times. \n\nRepeated iterations on the game would make one more adept at striking the right balance between protection and risk. It will make one more prompt in development activities as they are the source of fund and eventually time translates into money, so the faster the development happens, the more money one gets. It will also make one more fluent with the coping mechanism. It is also important to understand here that as one reaches higher levels in the game or as society reaches a certain level of development, it needs more fund than before to protect itself from potential risks and to grow further at the same time. Therefore at those levels, the magnitude of risk management should also increase accordingly.\n\n Even though the game models risk management very well, a further scope for improvement cannot be ruled out. There could be more variety of risks in the game. Apart from comets and rising water levels, there could be earthquakes and so on. Opportunities could also be dealt with similarly. There can be a sample matrix correlating the risk with a given severity, the damage protection levels, and the level of insurance required. This will reduce the random noise factor in the game (specially in making a choice between protection and insurance) and will make the decision making more effective.\n",

This gives the user a change to manage the risk. The user can conduct a\nresearch every time since the comet shows on the horizon. \n\nThe list on the comet gives the player an idea about the\nseverity of hit and chances of the comet hitting. This gives the player a\nchance to build a strategy in terms of research and protection . A comet having\nno chance of a hit can be avoided and the resources can be directed to the\nbuilding of pods.\n\n2)I played the game several times. In the first go I could\nnot save the pods, hence I just enumerated the mistakes I made in that turn. In\nthe subsequent turns,\n\n·        \nI researched the comet as and when it appeared\non the horizon. This gave me chance to protect my pods after the comet had hit.\nIn the first turn, I concentrated on building the pods majorly. This kept the\nticker green but a hit is all it takes. So in order to have some protection\ntime after the hit, I used the research ticker in the game. Hence in the turns I\ntook at the game, I learnt to hedge the risk by knowing the details and chances\nof a comet’s hit\n\n·        \nI bought insurance just well in advance so that\nat end if I don’t have enough resources to buy insurance I should get into any\nkind of trouble. Insurance reduces the anticipatory damages that are caused by\nthese comets. An insurance helped me a lot in subsequent turns I took. It\nreduced amount of resources needed for the rebuilding of pods.

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe trade-offs included time – it took time to research the comets and the time could be used to build or repair pods. Therefore I tended to spend little time researching the comets – I sacrificed knowledge. I bought the insurance level I was able to and typically ignored the comets. The insurance meant that it was pretty cheap to repair the pods which benefitted development. I wasn’t able to make the protection scheme work but if I had I think it also would have involved a trade-off of time. \n\nIf you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?\n\nIn round two I only bought the cheapest level of insurance and, at the end of the round, lost because a comet hit and I didn’t have enough time to recover. If I were to play the game again I would wait a little bit longer to accumulate enough money to buy the medium level of insurance. \n\nI didn’t learn anything from the game but I believe it was intended to show that repairs and improvements are both cheaper than building from scratch and that insurance is a wise investment because in the end it reduces overall costs. I believe it was also intended to show that investment leads to faster development even though it initially appears as just a cost. \n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nThe Oregon Trail is a very old game that is also about risk management. In it, a family leaves the east coast of the United States in a covered wagon. The family must purchase a mix of supplies. The mix chosen is obviously based on the risks the player believes will be encountered. The player has to choose between really basic items like food, ammunition, a spare wheel, and medicine. The risks range from running out of food, getting bit by a snake, being attacked, and having an accident that damages the wagon. Real life similarly has multiple risks and not every one of them can be prepared for equally and the element of chance means no player has perfect or even adequate information for predicting. \n\nIf I were to add one element to the Risk Management game it would be to add lives. This would greatly complicate an otherwise dollar and cents equation.",

It was kind of difficult keep with the\nconstruction and the protection of the pods specially when I didn´t have the\neconomical resource to do so, so I had to mixed the money I was getting for\ndoing so. Also, time was a handicap to achieve the construction and the protection\nof the pods. I wish I could had have the opportunity to create my own money or\nto decide how much I could use, not just waited to get it without my own\ncontrol, I think this situation was the one who most affected my achievement. It\nteaches me that we have to obtain a fountain of resources that we can manage. \n\nI played it more than twice and of course I was\nplaying it different each time. Though the result was different I had a big\nprogress the first 2 times and after these 2 chances,  I had less progress instead of getting more\nlevels completed. It was some kind of frustration who led me to do so. Anyhow,\nI´ve learned that we need to be prepared to any kind of unexpected event, good communication,\nknowledge of the possible situation we would have to cope, and of course,\neconomical reserves for every case. \n\nThe only thing I would (not change, but to add) do to the game,  it´s to have a way to control my economical reserves, and not wait until the\nmoney gets in the marker. That would be all. \n\nGood game. Made wonder and taught me 3 things, be\nready, knowledge, and save. ",

            "reflection": "The risk horizon game was an interesting experience in trying to balance development and taking cautionary measures to protect these developments. The game illustrated the value of preparedness and insurance coverage but also the complete randomness of natural disasters and severity of their effects.The game illustrated the role of risk management by allowing players to purchase insurance and/or raise their buildings to higher ground in order to limit the damage from comets hitting the planet. Purchasing insurance and raising the land cost money and thus diverted resources away from building pods, which were meant to represent \"development\" and produced an income. Also, because the protection method (ground raising) required players to click and hold a button, this prevented further actions such as building new pods or upgrading existing ones. The benefits of insurance and protection was that the damage from comet impacts was reduced and repair costs after the impact were lower with insurance than without. The drawback was that investing in protection depleted the development bar that indicated the level of development needed to progress to the next stage.Thus, the reduction in damage and lower rebuilding costs acted in a similar way to the payments made to Bangladeshi farmers to cover the cost of their bus tickets to the capital to look for work in the off-season; although in this case the same person is making the investment and reaping the benefits, it allowed for the possibility of a large payoff in the form of reduced (or no) damage to the pods and thus more money later on to upgrade or build new ones.After a few initial attempts where I failed to progress beyond Level 1, I \"got the hang of\" the game and started to make progress to the second and third level. After initially investing too much in insurance and protection, I altered the balance of new development and insurance so that development goals would be reached. However, at higher levels, even having Level 3 insurance policies and several bars on the protection meter did not prevent some extensive damage from comet hits, even those of moderate \"severity\". A comet hit, especially with a few seconds left on the clock, made it very difficult to recover and rebuild to move on to the next stage.While the game does a good job of highlighting the unpredictability and severity of natural disasters, it does not adequately reward players who are well prepared. It seems to make more sense in many situations to just focus on building so as to exceed the threshold development level by a sufficient amount to cover for last minute disasters, rather than depleting resources by investing them in insurance. I would tweak the game to reduce the depletion of money and development points for investing in insurance. This would allow players to reach and exceed development targets by a large margin and prevent a late disaster from wiping out their investment, rewarding those who managed risk better, while punishing players who simply build their way to the next stage without taking any protective measures.",

            "reflection": "Risk Management help me to confront the risk of comet and destructive waves in Alora Island while developing.To do this I chose to allocate my limited resource among; research on comet hitting and destructive potential predictions, procurement of policies, raising the elevation of the Alora and speed of development. Community connection increase our shared comet experience and resilience. determination to continue after the hit. Preparation for risk management enabled the development of Alora despite the risk of comets and destructive waves.I played the game and won stage one many up to ten different times, but was deprived of progression to stage two by destructive comets and accompanying waves that forces me down on the performance bar below stage one. This makes recovery difficult.I explored the options of heavy initial investment on development, research and insurance to heavy investment on research, scaled development or building of pods and relative investment in insurance. I also tried heavy protection and research with scaled development and insurance. But was not able to progress to the desired stage.I learned from the game that we need to confront risk in other to develop, as encapsulated in the comet and destructive wave risk of Alora. One  comet after another keeps emerging from the Horizon as our development effort bring us face to face with different risk scenarios. This impress on me that risk management is a continuous process.Investment in research pays off; that was an unforgettable lesson for me.the perfect balance required to build and develop Alora was difficult to achieve as real life situations may be difficult. Will power or determination is required to elect to follwo the course of risk management.I would appreciate the risk gamoe make available review of what one has done wrong after a stage is lost.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game provided a good opportunity for\nstudents of the MOOC Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development to\ndemonstrate their understanding of how knowledge, protection, and insurance are\ntools to handle risk and opportunity.\n\nKnowledge of\npossible shocks, the likelihood of them occurring, and the expected impact of\nthese shocks helped in the game to know what measures to take to cope with the\nshock. In real life this type of knowledge is essential in just about every\nsituation of life. Countries, states, cities, households, and businesses must\nknow what risks they face and the likelihood of them occurring before they can\nprepare to cope with them.\n\nAgain, in the game we had the opportunity to implement protection against the known shocks and\nthe expected severity of those shocks. In real life as well, once we know what\nrisks we face we can implement protection. In the game the protection was to\nraise the island from the waves caused by a comet crashing into the ocean. In\nreal life the protection we implement will be as varied as the risks we face\nand the organization we are protecting. For a family it may be protection from\nunemployment by using continuing education to improve skills and employability.\nFor company it may be necessary to protect their computer network from hackers\nand viruses. Also like the game, in real life the cost of implanting the protection\ncould be prohibitive to implanting the needed protection.\n\nInsurance\nprovides us the ability to transfer resources from good times to bad or in\nother words, in between shocks we should take some of our resources and save\nthem to help us cope with the next shock. One of the best ways to do this is to\npurchase insurance such as life insurance, health insurance, property\ninsurance, or flood insurance. Utilizing commercial insurance companies allows\nus to leverage our resources because a large group inputs into the reserve\nwhile only a small group at a time need to use some of the resources to cope\nwith a shock. Obviously if more is going out than coming in this will insurance\nprinciple will fail. Besides commercial insurance we as individuals can save\nduring good times to be better prepared for potential shocks in the future such\nas unemployment, injury, or retirement.\n\nThe game also illustrated how important it is for\ncommunities to develop connections\nto help each other cope with shock. This has been seen internationally in cases\nlike the earthquake in Haiti when many countries rushed to aid in the recovery.\nLike most of the other principles discussed here these connections are\nimportant for families as well as other organizations to help each other cope\nwhen the others are impacted by a shock.",

Thus to\ncombine the capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards\n\n \n\nThe choice of taking on risk and preparing\nfor it was appropriate because the benefits of paying in advance for\npreparation exceeds the cost of paying for the damage afterwards. Indeed developing\nand implementing risk management plan is cost effective.\n\n \n\nSince the goal risk management is to\nmitigate the losses and improve the benefits that people experience when they\nface risk and opportunity one cannot compromise on the combination of these\nthree actions: acquiring Knowledge,\nobtaining protection and obtaining insurance. However protection and insurance\nmay create synergies or require trade-offs.\n\n \n\nThe quality of information with less ambiguity\nleads to investment in early warning indicators and contingency planning to\nimprove emergency response which in turn complements insurance which serves as\na shock absorber.\n\n \n\nPreparation for risk affects development\nin the following ways\n\nBetter knowledge inform decisions about investments in\n     skills and educationLong term forecastingImprove productivityImprove investmentIntroduction of new technologies Resilience to shocksSaves livesQuick recovery \n\nThus with good preparation, only minimal\ncoping may be needed to recover quickly leaving more resources available for\ninvestment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks.\n\n \n\nIn the subsequent attempts, the following\nwere considered\n\nEffective planImplement the plan by embracing\n     thinking and adopting a new way of workingLessons learnt upon reflective practice includes\n\nRisk is inevitable in\n     developmentShould be tackle head-onRisk management is cost\n     effectiveTime management is essential in\n     risk managementEffective and efficient planningBroader thinkingMonitoring and evaluation (internal and external)PatienceBe realistic \n\n \n\nThe change I recommend is indicators for\nrisk in public place.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon Game\n\nThe Risk Horizon Game is a good game for taken decisions to\nensure effective risk management. I did enjoy the game even though I do not actually\nlike playing computer games because it takes almost all your attention. \n\nThe Role of Risk\nManagement in the Game\n\nThe main role of risk management in the game, is to create a\nbalance between Knowledge, Protection Insurance, and coping (repair \nsharing) to deal decisively of uncertainties. I was confronted to decide or to choose\nbetween insurance, protection and knowledge in order to manage risk effectively\nwithin specific time. Each of the risk tools comes with a cost, and such you\nshould be mindful about your choices. In the game, I would have wished to take\nmore protection in order to manage risk but it was impossible because there is\nthe need to balance the three main tolls given to manage the risk. In the sequence\nof the game, I realized that sometimes your inability to properly apportion the\nresources available would end you not been able to complete the level as a\nresult not manage risk well. There was an instance where I have to purchase\ninsurance but I had already exhausted the resources, therefore I was not able\nto secure the required insurance such made effective risk management at that\ninstance not achieved. In some instances, you have to forgo development in\norder to prepare for risk only to realize it did not occur. In the game, there\nwas a time I have to do more research, purchase more insurance and protection\nbut the comet did missed. \n\nWhat to Do\nDifferently\n\nTo be frank I played the game about six times or more thinking I would be\nable to complete all the levels but I could not. I was able to complete only\nlevel two. After the first and second games, it became eminent to me that I\nhave to ensure balance between acquisition of knowledge, ensuring protection\nand securing insurance and that is what I did. Though the three go in concert,\nsometimes looking at the severity of the comet you can ignore insurance or\nprotection.  Knowledge is what I think\nshould be acquire always no matter how less severe the impact would be, the reason being that having knowledge worth a million .\n\nThe Risk Management\nChoices That Matter in the Place I Live\n\nIf I am tasked to develop a new version of the game by\nadding one simple risk management choices in my area, I would add the religious\nbelief and their cultural background of the people in that area. I will also\nadd opportunities that comes with risk. \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "I found the Risk Horizon game interesting and educational in\nthe realm of risk management. Even though the premise of the game is simple the\ngame quickly becomes challenging as you try to balance developing the city with\nprotecting it from meteors. I found it difficult to meet the “goal” for each\nlevel because of the hard decision of whether to spend money on development,\ninsurance, or protecting the city. I had to play the game several times just to\nreach level four, which was the highest I completed. I tried several\nstrategies; multiple structures with little protection, one structure with high\nprotection, and just a few structures with medium level protection. I was most successful\nwith the last option with the 50% insurance option. \n\n \n\n                The\nfirst approach, building the maximum pods, left little money over for\nprotection or insurance. When a meteor hit the damage and repair costs were\nhigh. This approach made it possible to meet the goal of each level unless the\ndamage from a meteor hit was too costly. This development approach is similar to\nareas that expand rapidly but have catastrophic losses when disaster strikes\ndue to few protection measures. \n\n \n\n                The\nsecond approach, building one or two well protected pods, limited the amount of\ndamage from meteor strikes but made it hard to meet the level goals. This was\nbecause the protection cost money which meant those funds were not adding to\nthe goal. Due to the high level of protestation the damage from the meteors was\nminimal or prevented. Cities and countries often set development goals for\nthemselves either as monetary (GDP, Export Amounts etc.) or demographic (urban\npopulation, employment rate, literacy rate, disease prevention etc.). In order\nto meet these goals, officials must balance funding them versus funding\ndisaster (risk) prevention measures.\n\n \n\n                The third\napproach, medium growth with mid-level protection and insurance, was successful\nfor me in this game and probably the most realistic and probable in the real\nworld. By only building and maintain a few pods, three to four, I still had\nmoney left over to buy the 50% insurance and the mid-level protection. Because\nof the protection and insurance, when a meteor struck the damage was not as bad\nas with no coverage and the insurance covered half of the cost. The knowledge\n(research) obtained by studying the meteors was helpful because of the extra\ntime for connections after a hit. However this took away time that could have\nbeen spent adding pods or protection.\n\n \n\nBecause Risk Horizon challenges the player to expand their city\nwhile handling natural disasters, I find this game a good simplified\nrepresentation of challenges that affect developing areas and how risk management\ncan aid in their development. The game makes it obvious that there is a delicate\nbalance between meeting development goals and providing protection against\nunavoidable hazards.",

            "reflection": "The role of the risk management game was to make a player multi-task in contemplation, making preparation and taking action.  The risk that had to be taken was whether to take time to research, spend money on raising the village, spend money on insurance or spend money on building.  In the beginning I wasn't sure if I should build up one home large scale until completion and then continue to add another home at a time and build it up to completion, or whether to build all the homes at basic level and then build each home up a level as a group (aiming to upgrade them all to the same level at the same time).  I decided it would be best to use however much money I had to make any improvement to building new homes or building up the homes.  As it was cheapest to build a new home, if I noticed fast enough that I had just enough money to build a new home, I made that choice.  If my money had already increased enough to build up an existing home, I made that choice.  In the beginning I also waited for my money to increase to buy the best insurance as soon as I saw a threat coming.  After losing a level I changed my strategy and tried starting out by purchasing the cheapest insurance, and then focused to upgrade the insurance if multiple threats or a monster threat with high probability of hitting was approaching.  If I could change the game I would give the player pop up clues of what to consider when threats arrive or when the money in the bank increases, while they play in level 1 and 2 to help the player catch on to the strategies.  I assume and believe from making it to level 3 that the strategy is to build up as much as possible, and not keep much money reserve in the bank, until a threat comes and then money and energy should all be spent on upgrading insurance and raising the village.  Also the \"research\" part of the game was annoying to me because I could only focus on improving my research without multitasking to build homes and raise the village and/or upgrade insurance.  I realized that if I click to upgrade the homes before clicking on the threat to \"research\", then my home(s) would upgrade in the background at the same time while I gained research points.  It would be better if I could just do all these things at once and have them all open as pop-ups at the same time.  Also, it seemed that if I could memorize all the different insurance rates and different prices of upgrading the homes, then I could be quicker to make a decision to click on and activate these decisions as soon as I saw I had enough money in the bank.  But the funny thing to me is that in my real life, I would not be so concerned about \"building up\" (unless it meant it was providing better safety).  I'll assume \"building up\" in the game means that the buildings are becoming stronger and more durable to withstand disaster, and that it's not something aesthetic or more spacious.  Also in my real life, I would want to keep bigger reserve in my bank and be concerned to hold the best insurance policy at all times as earthquakes have no warning.  I wouldn't try to be constantly spending all the money in the reserve, which seems to be what a strategy of winning the game is.",

The role of risk management was to minimize the loss  due  to risk through protection, research and insurance. in terms of cost-benefit their was a choice to be made because for receiving a particular benefit you need to incur some costs.The act of preparation plays a major role in providing for the risk, if we prepare well before hand, it will cover up some upcoming losses, through research we can identify the risk causing elements and insure it accordingly. If we have proper knowledge of the risk then we can mitigate a loss but their is a cost involved, a risk-return tradeoff is here in terms of money.2.I played the game twice. I think i have to analyze the risk properly and then provide for it.Blindly doing the task is a waste of time and resources.The main things which i learned was that we have to analyze the intensity and keep on doing our research and also we should be realistic and provide for the foundations.We should try to find out the right incentive to manage risk properly.3. I would suggest to do a thorough research about the cause of the risk and elements involved and have a thorough cost-benefit analysis. The society as a whole should come up and take the responsibility to look after risk management. Take the example of Chile, because of the awareness and the governments people their risk was minimized to some extend though the intensity of earthquake was very high, managing risk is not the responsibility of only the government but the public too are equally involved and they should also take measures for the same.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to balance  between preparing for the shocks (comets) while at the same time expanding the community by using research, protection and insurance.  The choices I made and the trade-offs I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance were intriguing.  \nFirst in Knowledge I learned to research every single comet passing through by analyzing its severity and chances of hitting my community.  The more I researched the comet the more I was prepared with how severe the comet was and how to prepare my community by letting them know and preparing by insuring and protecting their pods. Second, Protection-wise the higher the severity of the comet hitting the more the protection. I would save my resources for a more severe comet hitting the community because by understanding the possible shocks (comets) and by reducing the chances of the severe losses from the comets (shocks) and taking advantage of researching the comets when I knew the severity and chances to hit us were low and increasing money to expand my community, plus community network increased protection. Third, Insurance was increased when I believed the shock would be severe and protection would match the severity of the comet to save on insurance. If I had to repair the pods at least the amount to invest in the pods would not affect us as much and at the same time invest the money to upgrade the pods.\nPreparation for risk affect development was done immediately to avoid any surprises and loss of money in the beginning while preparing to research each comet to avoid higher risks. \nI played the game more than once, what I did differently after the first time playing the game was building more pods to increase my community, researching every moment I could and matching the protection to the severity of the each shock.   I learned from the game how to think more strategically and how to balance between preparing for each risk and managing to develop my community at the same time by using the resources given to me.\nI would propose to change certain aspects of the game to represent the risk management choices that matter where I live such as include health, politics, government , regulation aspects to make the game more real.  This way I could understand how each section interacts and affects each other to reach the goal.",

            "reflection": "1. Risk management was used to help direct the limited resources we had in a way that would allow us to \"develop\" fast enough during each stage.  We had to choose between putting our time towards raising the level of \"protection\", researching the asteroids which had the potential to damage our community or the short time required to click on a property and upgrade (which took a while when you had built on all plots).  Another limited resource available was money, which could be directed towards either insurance, investing in the community to allow faster development or in increasing our protection to be more resilient to asteroid impacts. In order to meet the development needs of the stage, you were forced to either develop new plots of land or to upgrade previously developed plots to allow for an increase in production to the level necessary for the stage. Often I found I did not take enough risk and was not able to meet the output level for the stage, so net time I played I would increase my risk appetite during each successive play of the game.  Also I found that once I had raised the land to a suitable level to cover most asteroids, it freed me up to focus on ensuring that the level of production output was sufficient to pass the level (making sure the output was always in the green).\n\n\n2. I played the game more than I care to admit and I learnt some interesting thing which helped me get to level 6.  Firstly, reading the instructions helped me progress further, which an important part of risk engagement as I jumped straight into playing and didn't realise you could strengthen the communities in that time after an asteroid hit and reduce the chance of damage.  Secondly, using the trackpad on my laptop allowed me to connect my community faster than using the mouse.  During the first stages I would spend money on insurance as soon as I could afford it, however in later games I would wait until I was sure that there was a comet about to land that I did not have enough protection for and usually bought it at the last second if I thought I would need it based on the research I had undertaken.\n\n\n3. There are two changes I would undertake to make game more realistic towards where I live, firstly I would change it so different plots of land cost more but were more likely to flood than other plots and also different plots would have a higher potential for reward by having a higher production level.  Secondly, one of the biggest risk management choices I have had is deciding where to work and if it is worth leaving a company/country to work in other locations.  It would be a good addition to have the choice of selling the current community and relocating to a new part of the planet to start all over, much like a video game I loved in my youth called \"Theme Park\". \n",

            "reflection": "1.      \nAfter playing the game a couple of times, I\nunderstood the importance of what was taught in the past few lectures.\nRight from the moment I started the game, I realized that Risk Management is\nnot something which can be achieved by focusing on just one aspect of a\ndisaster. Rather, it is achieved by the amalgamation of knowledge, protection\nand insurance, keeping in mind the ability to cope with the result of the\nshock.\n\nAt the beginning, because of some\ncash-crunch I wasn’t able to focus on the protection part of the game. This\nlead to a high initial damage but I was able to cope with this effectively. With\nenough cash reserves, I immediately raised the land to protect from future\nrisks.\n\nAn aspect of risk knowledge which\nI found to be very intriguing was that there were some falling comets for which\nthe risk of hitting was very low. The knowledge about this was crucial in\nfocussing on other comets and in some cases on strengthening my existing system\nto withstand future shocks.\n\nThe preparation initially was on\nthe weaker side. This adversely affected the way the community development was\ntaking place. As the preparation to face the risk increased, the damage caused\nby comets decreased substantially and this in turn hastened the development.\n\n2.      \nI played the game several times. At first, I was\nfocussing on just one aspect of the game – Development. Soon I realized that\nevery time a comet hits, I was losing out on all the previous good work and was\neventually not clearing the levels. I, then, allotted equal weightage to\nprotection and insurance and combining that with the knowledge that I had of\nthe impending danger, I was able to cope with the damage more effectively.\n\nThe learning from the lectures\nhad practical usage in the game. Firstly, reducing risk through enhancing\nresilience requires an integrated planning process to make sure that structures\nare resilient to current and future hazards. Secondly, apply post-catastrophe\nrebuilding processes to increase recovery speed and lessen follow-on effects.\nThird, comprehensive data is crucial throughout the natural disaster timeline\nfor increasing awareness, finding effective resilience measures, early warning systems,\nefficient disaster response and resilient rebuilding.\n\n3.      \nIf I were to develop a new version of the game\nthen I would like to include an aspect where there would be incentives for\nbetter management of the risk. For e.g. I would like to give the player a bonus\nfor successfully being able to incur ‘no damage’ after a comet has hit the\nplanet. This could be in the form of bonus money or better protection\nincentives or the ability to research on the comets more quickly. The reason\nfor this is that the incentive for better development and in turn more\nprosperity could potentially motivate people to do better risk management in\nthe face of impending danger.\n\nI live in the coastal region of\nIndia. I believe a better way to track impending natural disasters would be a welcome\nchange. A case in point would be the tsunami that struck the nation in 2001. A\nlot of lives could have been saved had there been an early warning system.\nAnother aspect relates to the governance. The behaviour and cognitive biases\nthat politicians here tend to cultivate are impairing the way risk is managed. Excessive\nexploitation of common natural resources such as oceans, forests etc., is\nleading to environmental degradation and a future drop in economic growth.\nDissemination of knowledge on these aspects will help a long way in better risk\nmanagement and pursuing productive growth opportunities.",

            "reflection": "Recently I had to play a game called\nRisk Horizon . It was a fun game that prompted the player to realize how\nimportant risk management is. This game is based on the preparation and what to\ndo before and  after the comet hits the\nplayer’s  pods (dwellings)  that he/she builds.  This game was designed to prepare the player for\nthe unexpected, because it is not if it comes, it is the inevitable when it\ncomes, how hard it hits, how severe the damages are after the hit. Also what to\ndo after the fact \n\n\n\nThe good part is that there is a way\nto prepare through research and a way to protect through insurance ahead of\ntime. Also; the ability to absorb” the comet \nhit”, overcome the damages to the pods, then continue to build. Be able\nto bounce back quickly and continue. \n\n\nIn this game like every game there\nare choices, trade-offs you have to make while playing, thus  there are consequences as well. In fact there is\na physical aspect that had trade offs if building when a comets hits, it limit the\nplayer to either build additional new pod or repair the existing . The\nintellectual aspect ( decisions, knowledge/ research  protection/insurance)\nthat also required tradeoffs before the comet hit the player had to decide when\nto research prepare for future hits , and how to protect the pod community as\nthe comet was about to hit. \n\n\n\nIf I only  played the game only once,  or  had\nto play several times again, what I would do differently would be  to refer back to the instructions , perhaps\nthe tutorial . This along with the previous my experience ( “If any”) should help\nme be more be resourceful with the games’ tools. As you see it s focal point is\nknowledge through research, thus allows to see and prepare better. When you\nknow more your are able to see clearer , plus experience allows to  perform confidently . If you know how to\nprotect yourself from the comet hits and  the player knows what to do after the hit more\nefficiently thus he/she plays better. \n\n\n\nI learned many things from the game.\nI realized how important it is to research, to understand, to gain knowledge  in order to prepare, because we never know how\nhard  “the hit” it will be and when “the\nhit” is coming. With the right knowledge and ability to think it through, you\ncan plan and prepare better for that hit”. In most likelihood it will minimize\nthe damage, allow me  to cope with it\neasier and continue to move forward in a positive direct. To mitigate loss if\nany. \n\nThis game captures several aspects\nof risk management. If I had the task of developing a new version of this game,\nI would implement a way or tool which allows the player to have the ability to\nmulti task and to access others to helping hands…. “Strength in numbers.” \n\nThis change I propose would better\nrepresent risk management choices in Miami Florida where I live. A close nit community\nis key , along with  quick access to\nadditional tools that would allow the player to multi- task, do more at once..  For example; this” additional  hands tool” would  be able to, research and get insurance/ protection\n( Shield) while building or repairing at the same time. This tool would also\nallow to( similar to Adobe Photoshop  hand)  be able to move the scope of the screen around\nbetter , and be able to see more thus able to prepare better at a shoter notice.\n\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "The game was a pure Risk management game. The game teaches how a risk is managed in  time of problem,uncertainty. As the future is uncertain so risk is unavoidable. What we have to do is reduce the risk to as minimum as possible because risk can only be reduced, it cannot be completely avoided. The main things to manage in the game were :1) Wealth,2) Insurance,3) Development meter,4) Timing,5) Up gradation,6) Risk evaluation ( Severity of the meteors , Probability of hitting by the meteors)7) Research, and 8) Community connections.A good choice of all these factors help in protection and thus help in development of an economy. I played the game multiple times and improved over each and every chance. Some of the learnings are:1) Insurance play the most important role. Insurance plays an important role in planning, leading, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the activities of Community both before a loss occurs ( pre-loss actions) and after a loss occurs (post loss) in an effort to minimize the adverse effects on Community at a reasonable cost.2) Wealth is to be used judicially.3) Research always pays.4) A switch in time saves nine.5) Connections among community are very important.The improvement in the game in the form of things which, I see, can reduce the probability of risk or can help in reducing it and help in coping risk in a better way are :1) More of wealth. Even if seen in a real world, wealthy economies can tackle risk in a better way because of the larger amount of resources available.2) Cheap insurance.3) Easy up gradation.",

            "reflection": "Risk management meant everything in the game! and I must say I really had fun playing Risk Horizon and I am sure I will be playing more of it as well as introducing my friends and colleagues to it, it'll sure be a 'soft way' to get them to learn about risk management. Firstly, you had to develop your community to the best of your abilities which is a necessary concept in risk management as you have to properly build the foundation. This is same as the positive risk we take in sending our lovely kids to great schools and providing them with sound education. After this, a person playing the game has to ensure that he or she optimizes the level to which they want to develop their community, will you be developing the entire community? or just as much as is necessary to realize optimal gains?. This is a very important risk management concept that the game teaches because of the cost limitations suffered by individuals, households and small communities. The game teaches us that we can't buy 100% insurance or the highest level of protection all the time especially when you are just starting out but you can build on what you have in a step-wise manner this could be achieved by collaboration between individuals, communities, government intervention etc. Another important risk management concept the game teaches is the ability to recognize risk and also evaluate it to determine your risk response and requisite preparedness. In the game, the risks level was depicted by the comets severity, its chance of occurring and the protection level required to cope after it crashes. The player uses this info to ''ramp up'' and decide how much protection or insurance is required to save him and his household from the comet's negative effects.I played the game so many times! and I learnt at least one new thing every time I started a new game. At first, it was hard to get past stage 1! I then decided to  dedicate more time to understand the concepts and acquire the ''knowledge'' necessary to best defend my community. As soon as I understood what I had to do to survive I started to reach stage 3 and 4 nearly effortlessly. The game taught me to understand the risk, analyze the risks for possible ways to prevent it from occurring or at least reduce the impact if it did occur.If I was tasked with developing a new version of the game, it would be nice to include some real-life occurrences like introducing a hospital that charges a  high fee for treating victims of the community who were totally unprepared for the comets and so are badly affected by its destructive effects as against community members who took the necessary precautions to avoid the risk and therefore do not require to pay this fee, But I must add that the developers of the game must have really put a lot of good thinking into the games development as it is a very fascinating, as well as an educative game that teaches the core concepts of risk management.I have to go now, back to risk horizon! more learning ahead............I wish you all the best throughout this course and also in your personal life and your career. ",

            "reflection": "The three preparatory elements of risk management were evident throughout the game in the shape of research/knowledge; insurance; and protection. The constant evaluation of the severity and likelihood of a given threat becoming realised, and preparing for it, is at the core of what risk management is about for me and I assume that is the point of the game.\n\nI played the game several times and experimented with a range of different emphasis in strategy. Common for all attempts was a constant re-investment in upgrades of the pods in order to increase the resources available for more upgrades of both pods and preparations. In terms of my protection strategies I tried emphasis on research in order to increase community connections; I emphasised insurance to see to what extent a sustain-and-rebuild strategy would fare (not very well); and finally I also emphasised protection to better sustain impacts.\n\nPlacing the emphasis on one element of the three was not a viable strategy. I found that an emphasis on knowledge would nevertheless mean I sustained heavy damage from major events also with good community connections. A focus on insurance meant insurmountable impact on the development scale and costly rebuilding. Finally, a focus on protection also reduced the development levels, even appearing (imagined or not) to slow the revenue stream down (I assume this is part of the cost referred to in the instructions).\n\nThe strategy I found took me the furthest (just short of completing level 6) was an emphasis on both knowledge and on protection. I would re-invest generated revenue in protection, especially after the level bar was full, and I constantly kept research bars high relative to the severity of the threat of any given comet. I only invested in insurance where I judged the severity and likelihood of a major event surpassing my protection were sufficiently high.\n\nIf I got to add one element it would be fluctuating insurance costs which I did not get the impression are in play. If, like me, the player chooses to take out the insurance only after finding that one of the comets is a high likelihood/high impact event, then the cost for the insurance would go up substantially. I have yet to encounter an insurer who would not raise premiums if an event had become more likely. Thus, insurance is something you take out before an event is imminent or suffer increased costs and this should be reflected also in the game.",

            "reflection": "1. Without risk management (such as insurance or protection) it is almost impossible to clear the stages.There are four components of risk management according to WDR14. The relations are as follows:-Knowledge: Understanding the rules of the game. I didn't try the tutorial at first so I did nothing on  protection and totally got destroyed by a big comet of magnitude 7. After doing the tutorial I understood how to use protection figure.-Insurance: The insurance was quite straightforward, did not had trouble understanding it. As level increased, however, the cost for insurance went higher so after some failure I had to save for the insurance before I pass a level.-Protection: Protection cost not much at lower level, but as level increases the cost was going too high (and too slow to act upon comets) so eventually I saved only 4~5 spaces and just coped with broken pods.-Coping: Even if I did insurance and protection, there were events that pods could not escape from crisis. After the hit I faced broken pods and had to repair them. I could reduce the cost of repairing due to insurance. 2. I tried the game several times and finally made through level5.First attempt, did not knew how to use protection and without it I could not pass level3 because of the destructive comets.Second attempt, put a lot of resources into protection and insurance, but protection cost was too high to manage and could not pass the money limit.Third attempt, just before passing a level, I saved certain amount of money for insurance so when I got into a new stage I could buy insurance(of highest guarantee) right away.And I kept repairing pods whenever they got injured, because it seemed so slow with even one broken pod.Overall I learned it is impossible to manage risk without having all the components of risk management(knowledge, insurance, protection, coping).3. I would suggest linking action should be included in the \"peace times\" also. At first glance it looks like the community takes action only when risk hit society, but actually it's not. There is always social relationship going on with or without crisis(=comet hits). Therefore, as user develop the pods, he/she will also have to make a social link among the pods, building a social relationship even in normal times. Also, help from social part is also done after the crisis, so there should be another linking action after the comet hit. (More social link = Faster recovery)The place I live has a lousy system for risk management on weather, maybe it's because that we do not experience big crisis often. There is mediocre-level of insurance and hardly no protection, so whenever a risk hits hard, the damage is almost always massive. When crisis occurs, local community (government  private section) gathers up quickly and does everything they can do to reconstruct society. It is only possible because there are social actions taken at non-risky times. People feel \"included\" in the community and helping the injured member seems like a \"right\" thing to do. Without this, the coping process would be much longer and harder.",

The game did not allow sufficient time or resources to invest in\nall the 3 areas of protection, knowledge and insurance to the extent that would\nfully protect the community and put them out of harm’s way, so choices had to\nbe made as to the beneficial affects of the different risk management\nmethods.  At first I invested\nsignificantly in protection through raising the ground on which the community\nwas built, but this was not sufficient, I needed to have more of a balance\nbetween the different areas and invest significantly more in research which\nreally sped up the pace of development and lessened the impact of the calamity.\nTogether with making community connections, I felt research and making community\nconnections had the most beneficial affects on development and risk management\nas they provided communities with the tools and information to protect\nthemselves and bounce back from the effects of the calamity. I also always\nbought the highest level of insurance whenever a particularly severe risk was\non its way, that I could not prepare for in other ways, so that I didn’t\nexperience significant set backs.  Preparing for risks minimized the impact of\nthe risk initially as well as enabling the community to recover and develop more\nquickly going forward.\n\nIf I were to add something to the game it\nwould be to allow communities to accumulate savings that will make them more\nable to bounce back from the impact of a calamity through, for example, paying\nfor training that might be needed to reskill if they lose a job, or have their\nlivelihood wiped out. ",

I have played just few times and i have enjoyed to learn how we can set up our mind to act or react, to prepare, manage and gamble, to create and plan life, my objective was not to win, but to understand, i did, i won.I believe that since most of us come from different reality, culture and want to achieve different target, we all react differently to the game and the course, i wounder if you prepare yourself for some offensive comment, critics, and complaint, i prepare to those with one single question for those people: Were you ready to face a simple game?I believe they were not, we discuss and we study risk management with real risks and disaster in our mind, typhoon, earthquake, tsunami, financial crisis, and so on, but are we ready to face those events when we are not even prepared for the tasks ahead?We start to build from the us up, we will never be able to effectively manage risks if we cant manage ourselves.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game is capacity building  of a community by increasing protection and taking insurance to reduce the loss. The strategy for risk management in this game is by gaining knowledge on disaster or risk and its damage to be cause by commit and increasing the communities protection to decrease the damage. Insurance decreases the cost of reconstruction and sharing resources with other communities enables fast recovery systems. Risk affected areas need to be reconstruct as early possible and also increases their capacity to protect them from the damage of risk in future. I played more than once. I used different strategies to increase capacity, another time I tried increase capacity along with insurance to reduce cost of reconstruction and time. When there is frequent disasters/attacks we need to increase our knowledge, increase capacity building, which uses to mitigate the risk and sharing resources with the community people to form sustainable communities. I learned main things are gaining knowledge on risk, capacity building of communities, how to mitigate risk (in this game research), how to reduce the cost of damage (by taking insurance), sharing knowledge and resources with communities, we need to conscious about the risk while developing an area, otherwise there will be a significant damage.I would like to change the sharing of resources thing because there is less clarity to understand about that. Another thing at the impact due to disaster is not similar for entire community but I observed that every disaster has equal effect on all elements. So I want to change that thing.Finally I enjoyed in playing this game. But I'm not able to cross 4th stage.  ",

            "reflection": "Risk management is the act of managing risk so that to prevent or protect ourselves in case of unforeseen situation in the future. Insurance is also a crucial component of risk management because in case of future calamity the losses can be covered and substantially minimized by using this great tool of insurance in risk management.\nThe game was in itself was a case study of risk management. The game used protection for the pods by lifting the pods. The insurance was available to mitigate the losses in case of a damage by meteors. The knowledge about the damage from meteors by using research for meteors was very helpful to gauge the severity and probability of the risk of meteor attack.\nBy protecting the pods to the level of severity of the meteor helped in achieving protection or no damage to the pods even though it is hit by a meteor. By researching about the meteor and gaining knowledge about it helped in understanding more accurately the severity and probability of a meteor attack. By insuring the pods for 50% or 75% insurance helped in mitigating the losses in case the pods were damaged by the meteor. The insurance helped in faster recovery and used significantly lesser amount to cope up the damage scenario.\nThus preparation for risk by using optimized levels of protection and insurance helped in better , faster and cheaper recovery to the normal state and enhanced the coping ability of the pods.\nAfter playing the game for the first time, i learned only one component or approach to save the pods was not enough and was leading to the significant damage of the pods and recovery was not sufficient to proceed the level and win it. So, the next time on wards a balance and strategic optimization of the knowledge, protection and insurance components was crucial to reduce the probability of damage and recover faster and cost effectively in case of damage due to the attack.\nSo a balance of knowledge, protection and insurance for cost effectiveness is vital for any risk management function or entity to act effectively.\nThe protection and insurance components in the game are very realistic and follows the real life situations. But the knowledge part which comprises of the research of the meteors in not enough since it does not the conveys the risk properly so it is difficult to assess the risk and act. If the knowledge part is more elaborate and clarifies the risk properly it would be highly beneficial to mitigate the risk and act towards it more effectively. \nHope these changes in the next release of the game better explains the concept of risk management more effectively.",

            "reflection": "The Game of Risk Horizon is all\nabout managing risk. Similar to the cost-time-quality triangle of project\nmanagement, the risk management involves insurance, research, time and\nresource. Balance of all is required for successful completion of the project. Over\nstressing on one component has negative effect on others. If quality is\nstressed too much, it will cost more and time will not be favoring. The role of\nrisk management is therefore to skillfully find a balance between these\ncomponents so that the scarce resource is utilized to the optimum for the\ncompletion of the project in time. Too much engagement in protection may lead\nto depletion of resource without having time and resource left for research and\nconstruction. Whereas spending too much resource without giving due importance\nto protection and research leads to exposure to comets thereby destroying\nwhatever spent on the construction. Having insurance and research of adequate\nlevel was found to be helpful in protecting against destruction and in rebuilding\nthe damages. At times, when comets fall one after another rapidly, I found no\nother way but to invest heavily on the insurance as there is limited time for\nresearch.\n\nWhen the game was played for the\nfirst time, no thought could be given to the insurance. Although some\nimportance was given to the research and protection, progress of construction\nwas hampered as attention was diverted to comets and protection. After playing\nthe game more than once, I got the feel of the need of balance of all the\nelements of risk management. For example, if a group of comets come almost\ntogether, there is no way that research on individual is possible. Hence, a\ngood insurance was found to be effective. It was also found that a high level\nof protection right from the beginning helps in saving the construction from\nthe destruction. Nevertheless, a constant monitoring of the resource was found\nto be important. As soon as there is enough resource gathered giving due\nthoughts to insurance and protection, it was found important to engage in the\nconstruction and upgrading the pods. The main thing I learnt from the game is\nto keep vigilant on all the components of risk management and learn to foresee\nthe risk and thereby make appropriate investment.\n\nThe Risk Horizon Game does capture\nprinciples of risk management. However, it does not simulate real time risk we\nhave on earth. If I am to develop a new version of the game, I would develop\nmore realistic natural and manmade calamities the world is facing today. Flood,\nearthquakes, GLOF or even global warming would simulate the real risks\nprevailing in this world. Many poor countries have limited or no resources at\nall to cope with such disasters. With limited resources, risk preparation is a\nchallenge. The problem becomes more complex when substantial number of the\npopulation lives below the poverty line thereby making the governments to make\ntough decisions.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "The Game helps you evaluate and think of the different mechanism for risk management and their balance in view of the limited information (research) on probability and severity of impact. The different options of researching more the comets (info), building pods (and later upgrading them, more expensive if flooded), protecting (elevating the island) and buying different levels/costs of insurance made you test and reflect of what option is better in view of the different comets coming down. The Game adequately, and harshly, reflected some the randomness of events and effects (misses, different levels of damage, etc.), the mix of instruments to manage and protect from the risk and further development.I played the game some seven times failing twice level 1 and the rest level 2, and although I did perceive the effects of the different mix of risk management options, was still frustrated (as in real life) of the randomness of effects (sometimes I thought I had over-protected in face of the expected  severity while other times I thought I had under-protected, and the effects were the opposite of what I expected- ie, no damage when I thought I was under-protected and lots of damage when I was protected AND insured. So finally I concluded that although there are instruments and measures, coping and resilience will continue to be a necessary ingredient in high risk areas..... sorry Chile, Japan, California (for natural disaster risks)... and Sub-Saharan Africa, Bolivia, Nicaragua, etc. for poverty and food security, etc., risk management can only go so far...The game introduces initially 4 elements of risk management and later a fifth by pooling/networking communities; a more sophisticated version would introduce the HUMAN factor of risk acceptance/culture in different Pods, i.e., some pods would have higher risk aversion others lower, and you can spend resources in training/awareness campaigns at each Pod, so as to elevate the risk awareness and propensity to protect and save at each community (instead of having all Pods cost the same at every level). As we know well from all the literature, culture and propensity to risk protection is higher in certain cultures and regions, while in others (with the same level of development) there is a greater tendency in having family and neighboring communities share the risk and coping measures (view the Cohesion funds of the EU vs the small cohesion funds in other developed regions , which rely more on their own resources and generally if there are pooled funds it's only for after-disaster reconstruction). Other game improvements/upgrades would introduce a systemic risk management method, ie, you could spend resources in establishing a \"system\" not only individual measures and the system would have levels, for example only the system design would have a small initial cost, later strict implementation (project management) system would have a higher cost; finally the same with Monitoring and evaluation (ME or Audit as in the ISO management systems) would cost even more, etc. This game could also be part of a \"set of games\" which also have other modules for project management of risk systems, for monitoring, evaluation and audit, and for financial calculations /modelling (simple ones of course). This would form a \"Comprehensive Risk management)Well it was fun to play, the Game is quite good compared to what we use for business training; at my consulting firm TenStep we also have a project management simulation game - http://www.tenstep.com/open/miscpages/90.6.PM50.00PMSimulation.html  , which uses a Swiss software www.sts.ch, also with a random generator of effects based on probabilities, and an algorithm for taking decisions on the different project decisions- team, scope, quality , etc.)",

I have no idea what the role of risk managmeent was in this game. I could not get past the first level before I sincerely no longer care about the points I could be awarded. It was an infuriating experience. I am an instructor in the areas of public administration, public policy, and political science. I am not sure I would have used this technological, space-grabbing greedy little game in any of my courses! It would have been nice if the game gave me a situation I could actually work with (not something flying in from outer space).Question #2 is a mute point, obviously!Response to Question #1:I might have used river flooding as a situation, or an ice storm. I think I would have preferred to think about a situation using the knowledge I have about emergency services in my area, services and resources that might be triggered through federal programs; anything but a space cadet game!I am obviously not happy and even though a can appreciate the readings in the course I will probably give up on thinking about requesting a certificate!",

            "reflection": "(1./2.) The game Risk Horizon simulates some of the difficulties in balancing community development with preparing for potential  negative shocks through risk-management. In the process, it highlights the importance of finding a sustainable equilibrium of\nrisk management measures in relation internal conditions of a community and the external environment it is confronted with. As such, it provided a good learning experience in addition to the course material. It exemplified some of the flaws of one-dimensional 'fixes', and increased my awareness of the (cost-benefit) trade-offs that are to be confronted in sustainable risk management. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of an aspect of risk management that I had not fully taken into account.When I started out the\ngame, I had the idea that the best manner to let this digital community flourish was\nto cancel outthe threats stemming from the comets. Fully focussing on 'preparation' would allow me to limit the impact of shocks. In the long run, this would allow me to develop my community. Therefore, I enhanced knowledge\nby researching all the comets, increased protection by raising the land, and\ninvested heavily to gain full insurance. However,\nthis strategy of cancelling out risk rather than managing it turned out to be prohibitively costly and unsustainable. Continuously  implementing (inefficient) measures in order to avoid sequential shocks depleted my financial means, in turn, I failed to capitalize on opportunities to develop the community.  Subsequent attempts, I tried to find a sustainable and (cost-)efficient approach by\nmaking some trade-offs. I aimed to limit the cost of risk management measures by: taking the lowest insurance; focussing research on comets of which\nthe chance of impact was high; and raising land to correspond with the threat\nlevels of comets whilst simultaneously taking in account a feedback\neffect (e.g. the land-lowering effect an impact in relation to the potential effect of subsequent comets).\nThis enabled me to free up more money to invest in community\nexpansion and development, which, in turn, allowed me to generate more financial means to implement risk management measures. Initially, this strategy seemed effective. However, in the end I only managed to get to level 3 as I had not fully managed to minimize the 'development setbacks' as a result of shock damages. Interestingly\nenough, this pointed me towards the importance of the community linkages (in this case in relation to coping with the effects of a shock). Until then, I had not taken in account this in-game option that emphasises one of collective aspect of risk management. Taking it in account, I managed to reduce damages, which enabled me to further improve the community. This enabled me to reach\nlevel 4. \n\n\n\n(3.) If I would have to create\na version of the game that is more related to the environment I\nlive in (the Netherlands), I would focus on Flood Risk management.  The\nNetherlands has a particularly long tradition of  protecting its population and land area from continuing\nthreat of sea and rivers floods. This obviously means altering the\ntype of shock the digital community in the game is facing. Furthermore, I would\nalter (the operationalization of) some of the risk management components of preparation. To better reflect the national context, acquiring ‘knowledge’ in the game could for instance focus on developing flood\ninformation, forecasting and warning systems, and new standards of\nflood defence. ‘Protection’ could be operationalized in: managing waterways, water defences; and building houses that\nare better equipped to withstand floods etc. In addition, I would suggest bringing in an element of 'uncertainty', in terms of the effect of global warming on the sea level. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "Dear Reader,I have played the game and found that the role of risk management in the game relied allot on early warning. In this case assessing the danger of each meteor. The trade-off I should have made was reducing the insurance level once the risk of meteors were no longer present. I found that in the game the progress seemed to stagnate when I did not do this. Also the protection factor in the game negatively impacted development. This happened almost immediately. The thing I would do differently if I played the game again is to correspond my insurance level to the knowledge I have at that time. Since I live in a country with allot of water related risks, I would pay extra attention the protection and maybe add some extra features in that area, next to raising the ground. If I had to reflect on this game and the things I learned it is the importance and interdependence of knowledge (pro-action), protection (Repression) and insurance. One might have knowledge of a crisis to occur but if there are no means, or there is no will to act then risk-management is useless. With kind regards,Mark Schutrups",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game is to develop the community by building pots.To save the pods from damage i.e Protect by means of conducting research and also to insure pods against any potential damage. The duty of the player is to monitor the upcoming danger in the form of comet and to take required action. The knowledge level on the comets helped to make necessary arrangements and prepared to face the risk. I had played the game twice. I could manage second time to reach level 3 by spending more on doing research and constantly upgrading the pods. I could able to withstand the risk and i found it difficult when trying to develop new pods along with existing one. I suggest there could be some kind of technology tool available in the game similar to lighting arrestor which when installed could absorb maximum damage. This technology may be availabe if more than $1000 are once available to manage risk effectively.",

            "reflection": "The role  of  risk management is  how  to  to  reduce the the damage  due to the  impact of  comets without over leveraging on protection and insurance.. Initially  my   choice  was to  focus on protecting  the  structures  more than  anything  and spending heavily on insurance.    However after repeated efforts  to  finish a level, the  fact that  got  highlighted was the importance  of  knowledge of the  inevitable  impending disaster. Seeing that  disaster could not be avoided came the realization and clarity,that first most  important  thing is to understand the  risk. , then  how to reduce the effect of the risk and  lastly  handling  the after  effects The rate at which the  damages  were  repaired  directly affected to the availability of more resources.This is  what  one should look into.Just like  in a simple  case of  spread of a disease.Faster  the recovery rate, faster the people get back to work  and lower the chances of the  country  suffering from  economic crises due to  lower productivity of the  population The cost in terms of insurance and protection  reduced  tremendously the moment  I understood the  point behind the research of the  comets.  Playing this  game over and over again was  a learning experience  and  the biggest lesson being  the trade off  between protection  against risk and preparedness.  It is better to be  prepared than  be over protected, The opportunity  cost  lost is more  when  you are over protected  than you are prepared. As one is more  prepared,  the impact of the disaster  gets lesser. The reason being that  as  development  takes place based on   continuous research of the  comets,  one is able  to  build structures  that  can  withstand the effect and  hence lesser  expenses  in rebuilding. This  saving can be further  put  back into developing structures  which are  stronger. If i was to play  the  game again,  I would  pay more emphasis  to  first  get knowledge on the  impending  disaster, research and then look into  ways to mitigate the disaster. Natural disasters can neither be predicted nor be quantified. Depending on the  geography of the  place, economic and social systems  need to be put in  place  whereby the whole community works together. Knowledge of the topography  and  climate  conditions will help  as well. However one  point  after playing this  game that  comes  to  my  mind  is that knowledge cannot be  applied  if the general  level of  education is low. So  one way of protection is to spend on educating the people.  The  change  I would propose is some sort of warning systems, like a siren, when the comets  are visible. so  the  sense of sound can also  be used.",

            "reflection": "The risk horizon game gave me an well understanding based on risk management through meteors attack and defense. I think that the message tried to give to audience from this game is relied on 3 tiers. First and the most fundamental one is being prepared everytime for an unexpected event. Because the pace of meteors were different from each other, thus if you didnt get prepared yourself to hit you could get damage. The other key message was related with the researching of each meteors. although at the beginning of the meteor appeared on the screen, their severeness was seemed little, however after making research about it its severeness increased when when it hitted, its damage was tremendous. By taking into consideration this point, i would say that making research is crucial unless you think that you are well prepared to unexpected risks. Last but not least point is after one meteors hit your land, your lands level decreases. It means that even you feel like you are well prepared for future risks, you should check your status after an unexpected event lived. For aforementioned reasons, this game learnt me the importance of research for risks, being prepared for everytime and also making ex-ante and post-ante analysis for risk events. ",

            "reflection": "The most important role that I learned from the game is to wisely distributed the money between creating the pods and saving money for insurance. Time was also a factor, as I had to spend some time doing research. The trade-off at the beginning was that i couldn't spend too much time creating pods, as I have to same some money to use it for insurance, and the level thing on the right that consumed a lot of money. Interestingly, as I was increasing levels, money wasn't an issue anymore (i guess this is an example of a developed country), and actually, i failed to pass to level 5, because i was over-protecting too much, when I should have use the money to upgrade the pods. I guess that my main outcome from this game is that at the beginning, when you were 'poor', it was way more difficult to balance my budget between creating pods and protecting from the meteorites, but as I was getting more money, it wasn't too difficult, and actually i was spending money on protection even if there were no meteorites on sight or the risk was quite low. I played the game twice, the second time, I didn't over-spend in protection, specially when i was getting close to level 2. I put more budget on upgrading pots, I guess i felt 'safe' once I bought the most expensive insurance, and that allowed me to focus more on upgrading the pods. If I could add or change one more thing, i'll probably add a new random type of risk, this could exemplify climate change for example, a type of risk that can affect develop countries, and where there is little research. This would make the game more challenging when you have enough money to protect just from meteorites, at the end, i didn't even use my insurance and I was ignoring it for a little bit because I knew  I was already protected for the meteorites, but if i know that something 'random' can happen (bad management, riots, flood, hurricanes...), i'll keep an extra eye on my insurance money",

            "reflection": "The role and importance of risk management was very much\napplicable in the game.  There was no way\none could win the game and go to the next level, without using your resources\non research, protection and insurance while playing the game. This shows how\nrisk management is very important within countries and communities. There was\nthe need for some choices to be made in order to distribute resources\njudiciously and rationally. To make these choices, there was always the need to\ntrade up the price of some items in order to get others. I always had to make\nsure I did not put all my money-resources just on knowledge-research, or just\nfor protection, nor just for purchasing insurance. I always tried to strike a\nbalance for, just a little bit of protection can go a long way to save a lot\nwhen disaster strikes.  Even if your pods\nare damaged, the damage will be less if you are protected, as it could be\neasily repaid, especially if you had insurance.\n\nPreparation for risk can affect development\nimmediately an imminent disaster strikes, as well as after after the disaster.\nAn entire community can be lifted up and out of flood paths using the advance\ntechnology we have today. Some of these risk management could be done by\npreparing in advance through the laying down of sandbags, building of dams to\nprotect homes from flooding or by putting houses on stilts. When shocks such as\ndrought, floods, famines or loss of job by a household strike, it might be too\nlate to protect or buy insurance, but you can still make community connections.\n\nThe game was very nice and may be, because I studied the\ncourse material and went through the videos before playing, I did play the game\njust once.  If I were to play the game\none more time, I will first of all bear in mind that the resources I am working\nwith are very limited. This is because I learnt from the game that everything\nwe do has some cost whether in time or resources, and such is the way of life in\na world where nothing comes easy.  With\nthis in mind, I will make sure I put resources on research, while making sure\nthere is enough protection, as well as affording better insurance that would be\nuse to pay for any damage on my pods (communities).\n\n I learned from the\ngame that, community protection is a type of insurance. When disaster strikes, we\ncan help each other survive by sharing resources, thus, forming and sustaining\nconnections is very valuable in risk management. I also learned from the game\nthat preparing in advance can serve a lot of lives and property when an\nimminent disaster strikes. \n\nI live in a community made up of many students. In addition\nto research, protection and insurance, a rubric for financial aid could be\nadded in the game. This aid will be paid in the next level of the game after\nthe player fails to make it. Then, in the next stage/level, he/she will pay\nthis financial aid before proceeding. This idea comes from the point that some\npeople cannot effort for insurance. \n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game was in realizing\nclearly what I want to achieve in development of the area, identifying risks that\nare specific for this area and planning how to prevent negative situations or\nat least mitigate the consequences. The important part was considering how much\nmoney we have and then prioritizing what is important to do immediately and\nwhat can do later. This game also wanted to show us that for making right decision\nand prioritizing we need to have enough information. However sometimes we do\nnot have enough information and we have to think ahead and try to predict\npossible risks and opportunities.\n\nI had to make a trade-offs when I was considering if I\nshould do more development or if I should better to pay more attention to the protection\nand the prevention of risks. I also had to take into account how much finance I\nhave and what kind of insurance I can pay. Then I had to consider what option\nis the best if to buy the most expensive insurance immediately or wait a bit until\nI make more money so I can afford it. I had to think about my budget when I\nwanted to buy an insurance and at the same time I had to pay attention to other\nthings what were happening on my planet. I needed to stay focused on the big\npicture and all connection all the time.\n\nPreparation for risk affected development in positive way.\nThanks prevention I reduce occurrence of negative situations and threats or at\nleast mitigated negative shocks in cases that I could not to avoid a dangerous\nand negative situation – this was an immediate effect of preparation for risk. Knowledge\nhelped me in decision making. Insurance mitigated negative aftermath of shocks\nand destructive events, so I could survive crisis much better and with better\ninsurance I had shorter recovery time – this was an effect that I could see\nafter some time. \n\nWhen I played the game second time, I was much more aware of\nrisks and of what is the appropriate behavior for such a risks and situations\nthat were on my planet. I think that is also important that a developer (risk\nmanager) has already some experience with a crisis, so he does not waste a time\nand money. The main thing for me, when I played second time, was realizing that\nI have a limited budget and I have to carefully consider how I will spend a\nmoney. Another thing was realizing that investment in development makes money,\nso I can get more resources that way. The main thing I learnt was importance of\nseeing the big picture of situation and paying attention on all details in the\nsame time. The game showed that risk management has more benefits than costs.\n\nIf I could add one simple thing to the new version of this\ngame I would upgrade a community function. I would add there some shelters and\nin case of emergency people would receive an alarm notice and evacuate\nthemselves. So more people would survive and be ready to collaborate on\ncommunity development.\n\nI live in the Czech Republic and I think that my country needs to focus on risk management for finance threats\nthat face households. In my opinion risk management for systemic finance threats\nis sufficient, however there is still space for improvement. I would suggest steps for increasing of financial intelligence of households.",

In this game you have to managing risk and you do it developing houses, engaging insurances or involping protection. In each level, I improved those houses, I engaged an insurance and I improved protection. All this help me when a meteor hurt my world because it has a lower cost if meteor hit the world. But, with protection I avoided damaged in houses. The preparation for risk affect inmediately because these resources I spend in protection didn't go to world development. But it has a good side because better houses receive lower damages.I have played two times and the second time I spent more dolars on houses development and less on other tools. I evolved houses every round to avoid bigger damages. I have learnt that managing risk is a really difficult responsability and you need a lot of information and think what do you want to do with your limited resources. Also, you shouldn't forget engaged a insurance when it was possible because you can't prevent future problems. To conclude, improving your protection is a very good choice to reduce damages and you can cope new crisis.If I can change the game, i would add any system of financiation because i think this is one of the most important things because if you don't have resources (money in this case) you can not improve protection or engaged insurance.",

            "reflection": "Risk management involves both the ability to prepare for risks and to cope with the effects of shocks. In the game Risk Horizon, risk management included increasing knowledge of comets that threatened the world, obtaining insurance against comets known to be threats, and protecting the planet by raising the level of the community above waves caused by comet strikes.As a player in the game, I made choices that affected whether my community succeeded, as tracked by the color meter display. Sometimes, I chose to focus on development. As my community grew, my success rate on the color meter increased. The choice to focus on development often hindered my ability to withstand shocks from the comet waves. Compared to real world examples of risk management obstacles, my focus on development choices was like a lack of information. I knew the comet risks existed, but if I wasn’t paying attention to the threats, I would fail at properly managing the risk. Similarly, if I knew I could buy insurance and ignored it, my incentives may have been too strong to raise the color meter instead of protecting against shocks.One important lesson I learned was that I was avoiding risk. Admittedly, I played the game multiple times because I found it difficult to advance. In the MOOC, I’ve learned this is often the case in developing countries where shocks seem unavoidable or the cost of one shock impairs one’s ability to cope with other shocks. Like a farmer who selects safer crops when faced with a dry season, I stayed focused on the risk of a devastating comet strike. I didn’t take enough risks at first to learn more about the comets or evaluate my own ability to respond with preparation or protection.As I repeated levels, I gained knowledge about each comet. I compared the comet severity to my own preparation and protection. If I could raise the community ground to avoid waves, I could turn my attention away from the potential shock to focus on increasing development and my own success. Similarly, when information revealed potential devastation or a high certainty of shock, I could purchase insurance and temporarily divert resources from growth.If tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would add information about how much each development level (undeveloped plot, single house, larger structure) added to the growth rate of the color meter for game success. In the MOOC, I’ve learned knowledge helps people prepare for risks. With more information about the economic output of different development levels, I could better evaluate how many resources should be placed to preparing or protecting against risk. Hopefully, with better judgement, I could allocate the maximum amount of resources to improve development outcomes and game success.",

            "reflection": "The game is a very simplistic reflection on risk management and shows that there are several issues related to a situation. It shows that you have to make choices, indeed, and I found myself more focussing on the protection and not so much on the insurance and knowledge. It was interesting that on the higher levels however, also the insurance became necessary because there were more and more higher risks of getting hit. I was mostly assured by the effect that protection has: it is an investment that you do in the beginning with a long term effect that is relevant also for future risks. The knowledge is only relevant for that particular risk and therefore less efficient. The insuarnce again is long term although its coverage changes depending on the development of the locality.\nThe first time I played, I did not know what the research did to the possibility of reducing the effect of a hit, so that helped the second time. I also improved on building faster because without that the level can not be concluded. It became quite easy to reach the higher levels once I found out what the best strategy was. \nI think it is a bit too simple. I would rather keep level one as it is but instead of increasing the number of comets in the higher level, I would prefer to increase the complexity, for example by forcing to make more choices based on the costs (there was not much limit in spending in the game that I played) and considering relocation or different types of protection. Another type of risk could also be interesting to have to deal with because often places have multiple issues and have different ways to protect against them. \nIn the place I live, protection and preparation would be the main actions to migitate. Preparation in order to cope better is not part of the game, but would also  be relevant. Lastly, social, political, cultural factors are not taken into account. \nAltogether, I think the game gives a nice impression but it is too much simplified which makes it look too easy. It is like other computer games, I guess, that do not reflect the reality.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to maximise the gains of development while minimising the effects of the risks in play. With limited resources and time, opportunity costs had to be weighed against the dangers inherent in the game world. Being too cautious was soon discovered to be a risk in and of itself, as limited resources could not be replenished in time to repair the inevitable damage caused by the comets. Being too reckless however meant that in the time spent attempting extensive developments, the cost of ignoring the meteors exposed you to catastrophic losses without community connections and resources to pull together despite the lack of formal insurance.The game effectively reinforced the inevitability of disaster, and the necessity of having and honing a strategy and a plan to deal with it in advance. The possibility of a community to thrive and develop in the midst of great risks was surprising, and the choice to concentrate on only one form of risk reduction turned out to be a risk in and of itself. Utilising multiple risk management strategies was found to be the best and only way to effectively develop a flourishing community with risk resilience to weather future storms. A raised profile, cash in the bank and developed infrastructure was the best way to effectively ensure that in the future, insurance could be purchased as and when a large hit came, small hits could be survived without any further expenditure, and time spent raising the land in advance of a comet hit could them be better spent learning about its dangers and the probability of damage, in order to study the phenomenon and spend time creating effective community strategies and connections when the inevitable happened.After playing the game a few times, I began to realise the possibilities of alternatives to insurance, the obvious and immediate risk aversion mechanism with which I am familiar. Research and building community connections were found to make an appreciable difference to minimise the impact of and pinpoint meteor risks, and could be a real and tangible non-financial asset for support and repair in the event of large and inevitable disasters. I learned to question the ignorant assumption that research is optional or wasteful. I also found that implementing protective mechanisms by raising the land was time consuming but worthwhile up to a certain point, after which it impeded the ability to develop and build, and to research, as no functions could be engaged in simultaneously. I learned additionally to develop smaller buildings quickly and larger buildings conservatively based on the projected impact of meteors, to avoid loss of completed productive developments through mismanagement and ambition. Furthermore, I learned to keep some money in reserve for last minute insurance for high-level unavoidable risks arising for which I could not adequately prepare, and for future developments in the next levels. Most of all I grew to understand that to keep a small and conservative society completely safe would rob it of the opportunity to develop to the next stage, trapping it in a cycle of fear, misunderstanding the possibilities presented by known and managed risks. I would suggest the addition of three status bars to represent the three mechanisms of risk management. This would improve the game by teaching the player to balance the bars in order to achieve a green development bar result, and to remind them of their equal importance, and the opportunity costs presented by favouring mechanisms. Balance and proactivity is the key to success in this game and to managing the real challenges it presents.",

Considering this, the main thing I learned was the importance of a good research in order to acquire knowledge and preparing for the risk.A simple thing I would suggest to add to improve the game is some way to represent the systemic character of some disasters when they happen and the prompt action isn't done.",

I had to trade of protection in some cases to have more knowledge but at such times i was backed by the insurance.Being played the game more than once i could understand that having knowledge with protection was one key, rather than just building the protection for unpredictable calamity.the game on its own manages very well the idea of risk management it is meant to deliver, said that i would have liked to have the 'connection to society' which we only have to do after a calamity strikes even before an uncertain event which should add to the protection meter plus it might in my belief would suggest the importance of having healthy relationship among the community and the readiness to protect one another in need.",

            "reflection": "1.) Risk management played an important role as township had to be protected against the comets and it was a difficult task to judge how much damage it will make . the risk of comet hitting was a crucial part because hitting the comet or missing of the comet would only decide the funds needed for further development, Insurance was taken as a priority against the other two because some times knowledge and protection  alone cannot help to recover from disaster .the preparation has to be immediate because the development is affected and to keep the pace of development one need to be immediately prepared . to maintain a trade off 50% insurance 20% knowledge and 30% protection would be a right option to manage a risk. 2) Playing the game second time focus would have been more on development pare and more over to that protection from the risk would be the priority because no doubt the development is affected when ever their is risk but one could save the funds and can utilize more funds for further development if one has insurance cover or any other protection.3) one extra thing which was missing in the game and i would like to add would be the causalities and no of deaths and the other thing would be making a particular missile which would give me an option to destroy 3 comets in the sky it self because due to technology we have choices to over come from the risk , but the thing is we have to make the write decision , and three chances for all the six rounds would have been appropriate to destroy a particular comet.In the place and one option of fund generation which was automatic in the game . I live has big buildings what i think it should have a proper disaster management team , which wold continuously guide the people and should  a mock drill in case of a particular risk , that if in case a particular thing happens then how to react in that particular situation and how to work after that by performing it in front of the people  .Key Learning from the game was:Allocation of funds during the happening of a particular riskmanagement of risk in case of a natural disaster and that too which is known Preparation and after effects of a particular risk Determining the sevearity of the risk and damage it will cause to the townDisaster Management techniques in terms of money ( investment , fund allocations and funds generation )",

            "reflection": "In the game Risk Horizon, the\nplayer must create an ocean-side settlement by building pods, and from there build\nup the settlement via upgrading. Reaching a certain level of development called\nmilestones during a time limit means that the level has been beaten, with six\nlevels in total, each increasing in difficulty. Meteors serve as a danger to\nthe settlement, with each one having the capacity to crash into the ocean,\ncausing harm to the settlement. Each meteor has a meter for severity, chance of\nhit, and research. A meteor may or may not hit, and may or may not cause harm. Methods\nof damage control include research and elevation. By clicking an individual\nmeteor, it is “researched” as time progresses, and can only be research one at\na time, demanding full attention. More research allows the player to connect\neach pod in a random-lit order during a longer time limit after a meteor\nstrikes. The more connections made, the more damage is mitigated, with the\npossibility of no damage. Elevation, like researching, will demand all of your\nattention. But unlike researching, which is initiated with a small fee, elevation\ncosts money in short, regular intervals. The benefit of elevation is that it\nprovides protection from water damage for a series of meteors, while research\ndoesn’t. Research, however, provides a chance of no damage, while elevation\nwill simply moderate damage broadly. The last element of the game is insurance\nfor pod damages, which comes in three plans, and increase in cost each level.\n\nThe tutorial provided me the\nknowledge to defend and expand my settlement. I learned that upgrading pods\nincreases the rate of development, and that research and elevation provided\nprotection to reduce the magnitude of harm from meteor waves, while insurance\nprovided a great reduction in cost during time of need, when the civilization\nwas crippled. During game play, my settlement was never in harm. However,\nbecause of my focus on protection and insurance, my settlement didn’t grow in\ntime, and so my first few attempts ended in failure.  I was forced to reassess my situation. Risk\nManagement in this game meant I had to balance protection with growth, and had\nto take necessary risks for needed expansion. This meant reactive protection,\nwhich was cost effective, allowing me to allocate funds to growth and expansion.\nThe reactive “sword and shield” defense proved to be more successful, allowing\nme to reach level five my fourth and fifth attempt. \n\n            Considering\nchanges comes as a challenge to me. Living in New England, the only risks that\ncome to mind are minor civil disputes, financial instability and floods, the\nlatter which is well covered already. Perhaps give a choice of what kind of\nbuilding the player wants to build, covering power plant, residential, R and D\ncenter, education, and bank. At the end of each round, a report is given that\nincludes either setback or growths in each sector, with a ranking report,\nranging from one to twenty, representing the status of the settlement, from\nimpoverished to stable and thriving development. Each choice in building and\nupgrade affects that field, and each field interacts with one another, building\nup the settlement and leading to consequences related to protection and\nexpansion. Poor maintenance of any of the fields can lead to danger for the\nsettlement as a whole. These additions make sense in my case because the risks\nwhere I live are pretty much as the changes I described. When one of these\nareas are effected, the others react, leaving the population to deal with it,\nprepared or not. Great assignment, had fun. ",

            "reflection": "The game risk horizon was an exercise in the tradeoffs\ninherent between speedy development and protection for the future as well as\nbetween spending time on research into potential risk and spending time on acquiring\nprotection to guard against it. The key components of risk management:\nKnowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping were guiding principles to achieve\nsuccess in the game.  For instance,\nwithout knowledge of the severity of potential shocks (the comets) an\nappropriate level of protection could not be achieved and the decision to\ninvest in insurance and whether that was worthwhile could not be made.  The game highlighted the fundamental role of\nknowledge, of research, as a guide to making important future decisions both in\nthe virtual reality of the game as well as in the real world.\n\nThe inherent tradeoff between preparation for risk\nmitigation and actual development was a crucial aspect of the game as it\nhighlighted the problem governments in developing countries face: spending\nvaluable resources on risk management at the expense of faster\ndevelopment.  The point was well made—if one\nsacrifices protection for quicker development the impact of even one shock is\ncatastrophic.  However, if one\nover-invests in protection then one isn’t able to sustain a good level of\ndevelopment.  Although the temptation to\nreach ten bars of protection is high, it must be guarded against. \n\nPlaying the game repeatedly taught me the value of trying different\nstrategies to win.  Eventually, I found\nthe best strategy was an immediate investment into pods, no insurance, quick\nresearch on comets and then spending time and resources on raising the\nprotection level.  If, for instance, a\npotential comet was at 6 bars of severity and my protection level at 4, I would\nraise the protection level to 5 and spend time on research into the comet so\nthat building connections between communities could make up the\ndifference.  In this way, I suffered no\ndamage any time a comet struck and found it unnecessary to purchase insurance\nwhile also being able to invest sufficiently in development to beat the game.  \n\nA key difference I wish to highlight between the game and\nthe real world is the role of uncertainty. \nThe game gives us a lot of knowledge about what level of damage was\nabout to come and how quickly in the game; this is impossible in the real\nworld.  Research and good data are\ninvaluable in helping governments estimate potential risk; however, there may\nnot be sufficient time to prepare for them. \nI would attempt to magnify the role of uncertainty in a future iteration\nof the game—I would add two types of shocks and leave it unclear which was\nabout to strike.  Thus there would have\nto be an additional tradeoff between protection for one versus the other. Or I\nwould have idiosyncratic speed of the comets rather than the constant fast or\nslow speeds they currently have so that it is unclear how much time there is to\nprepare.\n\n",

            "reflection": " I believe that the game was able to clearly prove that if you want to prevent\ncommunity from some potential shocks and to mitigate negative impact of risks (if\nthey occur), you cannot achieve that goal without effective and responsible risk\nmanagement.\n\nPlaying the game I fully realized that my attention (as the Luminator of\nAlora) was supposed to be paid to all powers I possessed – Research, Protection\nand Insurance. I also learned from the game that all these three powers should\nbe treated with equal seriousness. They are interdependent parts of some\nintegral well-balanced structure – a kind of triangle whose very existence and\nshape directly depend on its sides. Thanks to Research, I managed to decrease\nthe severity and even the hit probability of some comets. Allocating resources to\nProtection, I could secure my community from comets that had reached the surface\nclose to the shore, as well as boost its resistance to potential ones. Due to\nInsurance, my community was able to recover quite easily after hits of some\nextremely severe comets without any serious financial losses, and I could also invest\nsaved money into further community development.\n\nIf we speak about preparation for risk, I think that Knowledge comes\nfirst. When you know what kind of risks your community is more likely to face\nand what consequences these potential risks can cause, you can adequately select\nand undertake all required measures and activities to address risk properly. That’s\nwhy in the game I quite frequently made my choice in favor of Research.\n\nI played game several times. When I played for the first time, I started\nit simply with building numerous pods and boosting Protection level, and I\nfailed. Then I changed my policy and started a new game with building of only\ntwo pods, allocating more resources and time to Protection and Research. I\nabstained from further construction of new pods and focused on upgrading\nexisting ones. And it worked – pursuing that plan I could quite rapidly\nincrease the rate of development and fill the development bar. Then, every next\nnew pod I tried to upgrade at once. \n\nAs for possible changes to the game, I would like to propose an option\nallowing taking different actions (can be limited to two) simultaneously as it\nhappens in real life. For example, when you are involved in Research activities\nyou can at the same time take efforts to boost Protection level. Or, at least,\nprovide access to such kind of option under certain conditions (e.g. extra\npayment, building freeze, etc.). ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to determine the risk of how much damage the asteroid would do in compared to the amount of money you had, the level of pod, and the insurance you bought. The choices I made was to try and increase the level of pod I had while maintaining at least 33% of the insurance and trying to research as much as I could about the asteroid.  If an asteroid did do damage, I was always most concerned about fixing up the pods immediately in order to create less damage the next time.  I thought this was important because having more and more damage was too high of a risk for me.  If I were to play the game again, I would definitely do more research on each of the asteroids that came through.  Some were hard as they were moving to fast but I thought it would be more beneficial to have as much information as possible.  I learnt that it was a balance between how much insurance to have - I typically started out with only 33% insurance - and how much damage was actually done.  I found that the more research I was able to do, the better as I was able to build more connections which allowed less damage to occur. Only towards the end of the game I felt more insurance was necessary as research and community building was very hard to do.  I don't think I would change anything in the game. I felt that it captured risk management very well and how it is always changing.  This came in the variances of speed of the asteroids and how it allowed for a lot or very little research.  I think that the game represented risk management very well.  The only criticism I had of the game was how fast the money kept coming in. I felt that by the end of the game, I would have been able to have the fullest protection again the asteroids without any problems, therefore created almost no risk.  Overall, I think the game portrayed how risk management is always changing and how hard it is to determine the outcome of a disaster, especially when it appears as if it is going to miss and then ends up hitting and causing more damage than expected.  I found the game to be very useful though and was able to show me how I manage risk and my thoughts and reactions to it.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to\nminimize the losses of a comet strike while still maintaining enough production\nfrom the pods to beat the level within the time constraint. Surprisingly none\nof my tradeoffs included knowledge or insurance; rather, I used all my\nresources on raising my village to a very high defensive level and\nbuilding/upgrading the pods to increase my production. In the first level I\nallocated a vast amount of resources to elevating my village to protect it from\nthe surges caused by the comets. This strategy cost me a lot of resources upfront\nand slowed my pod upgrading.  However,\nthe  focus on raising my city meant that I\nalways had a high baseline level of protection and it was quick and easy to re-raise\nmy village after comet strikes. \nFurthermore, it saved me money on insurance and knowledge as these two\naspects where less important given the level of protection resulting from my early\ninvestment in my villages defenses.  This\nthen allowed me to focus the majority of my resources on upgrading my pods thus\nincreasing my production which in turn made completing the levels relatively\nsimple as I would often finish with thirty to forty seconds to spare.\n\n \n\nI only played the game once because on my first try\nI managed to get to level 6 and almost beat it. \nThat said if I could do something different I would have bought a small\namount of insurance as when my villages defenses were eventually overrun it\nwould have been very nice to have cheaper repairs. Furthermore, I would have\nallocated more resources to pod upgrades rather than raising my village early\non in the game because in the later game more money is produced and thus there\nis more money to allocate to defense without hurting production. \n\nThe main thing I learned from the game was how to\nallocate scarce resources and how to balance protection and production. If you\ninvest to too much of one aspect than you will not pass the level. However, at the\nsame time if you do not invest enough in an aspect you will fail the level. This\nis essentially the dilemma of all people working in risk analysis as they must operate\nin an environment of finite resources.\n\nThere are a few things I would change about the\ngame. First I would link the cost of insurance to the number of pods rather\nthan the level one is at.  Second, I\nwould allow the player to invest in a missile defense system that could shoot\ndown the comets; however, this would be very expensive and could only be used a\nfew times a turn. Last, I would lessen the amount of protection provided by raising\nones city as it allows the player to avoid both insurance and research and thus\nnarrows their focus.    \n\n \n\n ",

Of course the consciousness and awareness of the\npossible attack also helped in the preparation for it and also protecting the\npods from being attacked.\n\nHOW PREPARATION AFFECTS DEVELOPMENT\n\nPreparation for the risk\nprevented the country (pods) from being wiped out. Sometimes due to the\npreparations, the possible attack did not have any effect on the pods. The\nawareness and consciousness of the attack provoked adequate preparation both on\nthe insurance policy. The preparation policy 75% coverage also saves the\ncountry enough funds to manage the possible effects of the attack.\n\nPLAYED IT MORE\nTHAN ONCE\n\nWhat I did differently was to\nincrease the protection rate often enough to prepare for the possible attack. In\nthe first attempt, I hardly increase the protection rate and this often prone\nthe pods to possible effects of the attack. This explains that in risk\nmanagement, the protective and preventive measures should be strengthened and\nrevisits concurrently to prevent future attack and reduce its effect if occurred.\n\n\nDEVELOPING A NEW GAME\n\nWhat I would like to add is, in\ncase of flood, I would create room for drainage creation.

Preparation and research is always important because it's not something to be done when the crisis is upon us.It is important to have a good grasp and a balance between everything - we can't expect to \"wall ourselves up\" and think that we are ready for everything, nor we can afford to just invest everything into our economy, thinking that we can just throw money at any problem that may arise in the future.I've also learned that action before hand and action after a crisis strikes are both very important.I live in a country where one of the main banks kinda defaulted (well, it was kinda robbed by the director board lol) so in terms how I would have changed the game - I would have added internal economic threats and change the theme of the game to be more understandable (let's say it's a village/city on the beach, the pods can be quarters in the village and then city and instead of comets - different kinds of waves). So it would basically be like population happiness meter which will give bonus to the progress bar and money generation. It will depend on how well the player is prepared - a crisis strikes but no damage, people are happy, below 30% no change, over 30% damage and people are restless - can we fix everything up in 30 seconds? if so it's a boost the happiness meter.The bonuses wouldn't be huge, but they will be a good addition - should the game require a new feature.",

Protection was gained from building network\nwith the community and insurance helped reduce the cost of the impact of the comets.\nInsurance helped spread the cost, however as there were three options on the\ntypes of insurance this was a challenge because measuring the amount of risk the\npods were to face was difficult and near to impossible.\n\nWhen there\nwas a comet which had an adverse impact on the pods, it was wise to take up\nhigh insurance which covered 75% of lost. It was effective to build the\ncommunity when faced with comets with low severity and chances of hitting the\npod. It is very important to have liquid assets to cover the cost of lost. \n\nPreparation\nof risk affected development after some time.

By gaining knowledge on different techniques\nof protecting and mitigating risks as well as understanding how insurance works\nand where and how to invest money. Over insuring brings loss and under insuring\nbrings lack of knowledge. It was very important to see the technical understand\nand the formula of how insurance, protection and risk coincide.

For example, the player can make a alarm and move the citizens to a  shelter, during that time , community development stops mounting but community development will become faster after  disaster, while broken structures can recover faster.",

Some level\nof protection was essential from the beginning but knowledge was key to\ninvesting time and money wisely on protection and/or insurance. Insurance was\nbeneficial however I delayed purchasing it, instead diverting funds to protecting\nthe colony. Once a satisfactory level of protection was reached, I devoted time\nto research - particularly when the risk was large.\n\nInitially I constructed\nlots of pods and then once a comet was on the horizon, I researched it and\nacted accordingly. I didn’t succeed in getting beyond level 3. The next time I\nplayed I built less pods and protected them with the money that was being made,\nI then upgraded one or two in the name of making more money quicker so I could\nreinvest that money on more protection, insurance and upgrades - a kind of\n‘trickle down’ approach. Using this method and investing time in research while\nthe pods were being developed meant I completed the game. I learned that a\nlarger, less developed colony with little protection or insurance is\nsusceptible to loss from risk. A colony with resources spent on protection from\nand insuring against risk proportionate to its size, can avoid losses from\nrisk. Knowledge, protection and insurance are all necessary for prosperous\ndevelopment.\n\nThe risk in the game was\nexternal to the colony and comets missed more often than they hit. Inhabitants didn’t\nbecome overconfident, thinking the risk was minimal or some other colony’s\nproblem. They didn’t question where the money was being spent or voice concerns\nthat it should be spent elsewhere with potentially immediate benefits for them\ne.g. a new school, hospital or infrastructure. I would add an element within\nthe community that could be opposed to money or time spent on insurance,\nprotection or research. The game would then need to incorporate education as a\nfactor to channel money towards in order to inform the community of the risk and\nreduce opposition to spending on protection or insurance. Money spent on these\nthings when the community was opposed to it would increase civil unrest and\nreduce the rate of development.",

            "reflection": "The game provided me with a chance to glimpse what risk management is. In the game, I had to prioritize the risks by research based on the severity and probability as some of the risks are happening simultaneously. I also had to allocate limited resources to the development target while providing appropriate protections. I haven't paid attention to the research until I lost a couple of games. After then, based on severity andprobability of risk, I could decide which risk to focus on when risks are coming simultaneously. When severity was low or became low by research, I could even take them and focus on other risks and other development of priority. I have also tried a couple of games to maximize protections but such protective actions could not be achieved due to the limited resources. Best protection must be best. However, in the real world, consideration should be paid to the available resources which made me understand that protection is something to be balanced. In this sense, insurance was felt like a financial burden at first as I was more focusing on the development and the return of resources rather than damage. From this, insurance was regarded something like redundancy which can be engaged in the later stage when I become to think I can financially afford to redundancy. As the game is played in the limited time frame, it seems the players are more focused on the preparation for and protection of risks and pay less attention to the recovery from damages. It seems to be that effect of insurance is less stressed in the game as I think the players cannot sense the comparative effects of insurance and amount of insurance coverage. Risk is something we cannot be free from and adversely affect what have been developed and achieved by way of damage, loss and/or delay. Preparation of risks reduce and prevent such adverse effects of risks. First thing to do is to understand the risk itself just, as it was in the game, severity (adverse impact) and probability. Understanding of risk is the starting point of the preparation of risk. Preparation includes hedging of risk, minimizing of impact and recovery from the impact. Risk management is something to well balance all of these activities. I am not a good game player. The game was so discouraging as I could not even pass the second stage despite multiple tries. I became to think, in the real world the risk management is nothing easier than a game. \"Discouraging enough!\"  I know there are many more people strive to fight against and prepare for risks in their own fields like me. I will take my part.    ",

In each case u study the risk, the possibilty of hitting your buildings and try to cope with, made decision such: if the risk is not very high and you haven't enough solde you can let it hit yours and then the damage will be reperable easily, also you can buy an insurance to amortize the effects. The preparation for risk affects development after a time.2- After the first time playing (losing at first level :) ), I made a short concertation with my self: I must made an insurance for the buildings, I must let some solde used as prevention for  the next comete hit. Playing this game teach us that we are always fronted to a risk, and we must always keep it inti consideration by preparing for it: making insurance, studying the degree of risk and make decision to continue or changing the way of playing, which component of the game is to be used in a specific time of the game.3- Other type of risk could be added that influence also the insurance, it may be ana insurance that can be affected with a risk of losing it. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was basically to prevent crises where it is possible, Minimize the impact of crises where the crises is inevitable and also managing the effect of the crises by building resilience. All these could be done by using the tools of research and insurance. In the course of the game which is more like a real life situation, I had to make choices that enabled me to achieve the objectives of risk management. the choice of the class of insurance to buy puting into considerations the amount of money or resources available for the development of the pods, and with the help of cost benefit analysis and also failing in the cause of protecting the pods i was able to set my priority right and develope a good policy that helped in protecting and developing the pods with the available resouces. hence with the knowledge of risk management in the situation in the game i had make the preparation for risk my priority, then buying insurance and developing the pods, and these took someting after suffering devastating effect and shock of the risk.I played the game more than once, infact after failing several times i had to change my policies, i had to do things deiferently from the way i started which obviosly was not working. I concentrated more on preparation for the risk based on the reseach result or anticipated inpact of the risk. I also changed tha class of the insurance i buy  to enable me have more resouces for developjng the pods. my strategy was chaged to: 1. preparation for the risk, 2. Developing the pods, and 3. buying insurance to ease the effect of the risk and help in rebuilding and developing the pods in case of any damages.If I were to deveope a new version of the game, i would propose the opportunity to choose where one can build and deveope pods, building and developing pods in high risk area and low risk area, so one could choose how to manage the available resources in managing risk for the high and low risk area, it will task the policy makers or risk manager on where to increase preparation, insurance and other tools of risk prevetion and managemnt given the available resources.",

            "reflection": "     During the coursea course: Risk and\nOpportunity, Managing Risk for Development course, we were asked to participate\nin a Risk Horizon game based on materials we have learnt throughout the course.\nAlthough I only participated in the game twice, there was a significant\nimprovement to the score based primarily on knowledge of the game. \n\n \n\n     The role of risk management is apparent\nthroughout the game in the form of knowledge, protection and insurance. The\nvariables in the game related to these three aspects are the research, the\nelevation of the land as well as purchasing insurance respectively constrained\nby currency as a resource. As building construction was the only simultaneous\nrunning aspect, the three aspects were all trade-off of each others with money\nas a constraint. However, with information regarding the comet as well as\ninsurance / protection being semi-permanent, the trade-offs was clear. \n\n \n\n     With insurance being provided by a third\nparty, it was clear that protection could be gained immediately and the risks\nare hedged. However, the timing of when to buy insurance and what type to\noptimize the payout greatly affects the economy. This preparation of the risk\nimplied a real world problem of not having duely warning regarding shocks such\nas black swan and creates a sense of waste in investing in insurance (if over\nprotection was used and the payout was not worth the insurance). \n\n \n\n      The implication of these trade-off taught\nme the optimization of resources and unlike other real time strategy games,\nsometimes there are not enough time / resources to optimize it all on the go. This\nwas apparent on my first run-through of the game after skimming the\ninstructions. Although I understood the framework of having knowledge before\ninsurance and protection, I hastily built protection of elevation and wasted\nsome of the resources I could’ve used at a later stage with the knowledge from\nthe comets. This implies the paramount importance of knowledge of the shock\n(comet) before wasting resources (money) on protection (elevation of land).\nThis knowledge helped the second run-through all the entropic nature of the\ngame damaged my score with heavy comets.\n\n \n\n     One element I would improve on is the\nmini-game in regards to preventing damages. I would definitely make it easier\nto see the effect of the game in prevention of the comet. The prevention is\noften random with damage dealt regardless of the outcome of the game.\n\n \n\n     With the conclusion of this game, this real time strategy game shown me the importance of timing in using protection as well as the importance of information. Although the result was not satisfactory to my liking, the improvement with each run-through shows the effect of preparation and risk management in general.",

            "reflection": "1) The role of risk management in\nthe game was to sustain the city’s growth. If the city was constantly hit by\nwaves it became impossible to invest on the city itself, resources would be\nneeded to repair the damage and it would waste time that could be spent on\ngrowth, research and so on. My main issues were knowledge and protection.\nInstead of building lots of construction I preferred to focus on three or so\nearly on to have a better flow of resources and be able to spend more on\nprotection. I didn’t really used insurance that much, in fact I kind of\nneglected it. It seemed much more useful to spend time and resources on\nprotection and research and actually prevent the damage, rather than dealing\nwith it. \n\n2) On my first try I still wasn’t\nsure of what to do and what effects my actions had in the game. The next time I\ntried to develop fast and focused only on protection, and didn’t get good\nresults. I had better results balancing protection and research on the next try\nand could get to higher stages. If I could play more, I think I would try to\nexplore more the utility of insurance. I couldn’t quite grasp it in my plays. I\nthink that the most important thing I learned from the game was the relation between\nrisk management and progress. It’s a hard thing to balance, on one hand\nspending time and resources on risk management can slow down your progress, on\nthe other hand without a good risk management everything you built could be\nlost in the worst case. \n\n3) Brazil suffers a lot from social\ninequality. If I could add something, it would be the citizens capacity of\nmaking some preparations themselves for when the worst happen. On that case,\nmore developed buildings would get better coping mechanisms. And the player\nwould have to deal with something when inequality became too strong (the “poor”\nsuffering much more than the “rich” when a meteor strikes), like riots and vandalism.\nThis coping mechanism could be a fund that would be used to repair the building\nin the case of a strike, allowing the citizens to cope themselves with the\nimpact of minor damage. In case of great damage the citizens would be able to\nstart the repairs by themselves but would need funds from the player to finish\nit, saving some time for the player, especially if a meteor strikes with full\nforce too close to the deadline. And riots would damage buildings and slow down\nrepairs if not controlled.",

As a part of this world\nour needs, desires, and expectations are in change as well.\nNevertheless, there are limitations and boundaries which we have to\nconsider while we are trying to adopt with the changing concept.\nThe\nrisk management game reflects three important concepts that related\nto the change attribute of our world, these concepts are: knowledge,\nprotection, and insurance.\nIn\nfact, the three concepts which were mentioned above are interrelated\nactivities. When it comes to the game, in order to build a city you need the “know\nhow”, which is the knowledge. At the beginning you need to educate\nthe community thus building research centre or education institution\nis highly important. After creating a base of knowledge you need to\nprotect this base of knowledge from the surrounded risks (e.g.,\ndemolishing or disappeared of knowledge) by enhancing this knowledge base and put it\nin practice, integrate the different pieces of information and add on\nthem. However, you should consider the available resources thus you\nneed to secure your community from different types of risks, such as\nnatural disaster or limited funds. Insurance coverage considered to\nbe a very effective way that will help to confront uncertainty and\npossible risk by reducing the impact of unexpected or potential\nconsequences. Thus, the community will not stuck and it will be able\nto adopt with sudden changes in circumstances.\nNevertheless,\noveremphasizing the potential risk would hinder the development of\nknowledge. Moreover, lack of planning for long term and concentrating\non short term gains will lead to a big loss eventually.\nThe\ngame could be improve by inserting the quality aspects. For instance,\noffering different type of material to build the research centre with\ndifferent prices and different tolerance level to potential level.",

            "reflection": "\tIn the game Risk Horizon risk management is modeled by the construction, development, and protection of the pods on the planet. The construction of pods takes place on the planet and simulates the expansion of living areas in the world as well as the increase in world population by the development of pods. The development of pod through levels changes them from primitive ones to more complex, reflecting urbanization. The risk posed to the progress bar filling up through building and progression comes in the form of comets and meteors flying at different speeds and having different values for severity and chance of contact. All Risk management is reflected in Risk Horizon through the three options of security through buying insurance on the damage caused by the comets, preparing for the risk before knowing it will happen by raising the platform, and coping with risk by conducting research on the comets as they are falling to improve the chances of having no damage. Preparation for risk using any of the three methods had the opportunity cost of not being able to spend the money used on protection for development or new construction, and even though research was free, while the research window was open no other game actions could be completed and therefore development was slowed in the short term by managing risk. In the long term development of the pods, risk management made growth possible since the effects of comet hits would be minimal and more money would be available continually. \n\tI played the game twice, and changed by gameplay drastically from the first time to the second. The first time I played Risk Horizon, I noticed that when I was raising the platform or if I purchased investments, my bar would turn red so I immediately avoided those investments and put all my funds into the construction and development of new pods. My only risk management was research of the comets, which was effective for the first two levels, but when the number of comets increased I could not cope with all of them and they ended up damaging my pods so much that I ran out of time and funds to reach the development requirement. In my second turn, I put all my money immediately into the maximum insurance as well as raising the platform as high as possible. While in the first two levels I barely reached the development requirement in time, I reached level five since I easily dealt with the increasing number of comets.\n\tIf I could add a concept to this game I would make it possible to focus research on more than one comet since in real life risk management must cover multiple risks coming at you at the same time much like the comets. If we only focus on one problem, we ignore the other ones. We must remain vigilant of all the risks in life that can affect us and be able to distribute out efforts in coping with multiple problems and prioritizing our efforts for maximal protection. \n\t",

Tried as much as possible to notice the pattern of strikes and trend of the game, then tried to build and upgrade structures as much as possible before first strike, build a strong protection based on information gotten from research on each meteor, then get the best insurance plan for relatively cheap and quick recovery after strike if any damages was caused at all.3.

            "reflection": "Risk\nmanagement play a key role in the game. Risk management deals  with:Identifying the risk and the prioritizing the impact and probabilityRisk Analysis and responseRisk MonitoringThe comet hitting\nAlora is the identified risk that has  to be assessed for severity  and\nresources had to be allocated to reducing the impact. Research was the key\ncomponent I used for success, knowing the severity of the impact and the\nchances of the comet hitting enabled me to plan the use of my financial resources.\n The trade off was made protection\nagainst development. Development is  costly venture and all other factors are tied into the level of development. The more advance your development the more costly your insurance and repairs. This lead to development taking place after all other measure to mitigate\nrisk had been put into place and there were sufficiently resources to allow further development and pay for repairs. \n\nI played the\ngame more than once, I did not realize in the first instant the need for research\nand the manner in which I developed the village was too rapid raising the repair cost of the damages. Therefore in the next game play I focus on research and developed the\nvillage  at a slower pace with all my\nrisk mitigating measure in place. Insurance played a key in reduce cost of the\ndamages because the issues was never if the event will happen and the extent of\nthe damage. It enable to keep my resource at a level to repair the damages and\nallowed for continued development. I learnt the research and development is the\nkey to proper risk management, identifying the risk and its' impacts can allow\nyou to prepare for the risk and create opportunities. Resource management\nplayed a very circuital role because a balance had to be obtained between\ndevelopment and cost to repair damages. It also spoke to the level of\ndevelopment, the higher the level of development the more cost the repairs.\nCommunity connection was vital in reduce the level of damage after the event\nand it speaks to the in reality. An informed community can work together to\nreduce the impacts of the risk that they face.\n\n \n\nTo better\nrepresent the risk management choices that matter to my environment I would\nchange the manner in which the damage and insurance is applied. Once the\ninsurance is purchase the entire village is covered. I would make the purchase\nof insurance per pod giving a true reflection of village. Therefore not all\npods will be insurance or even at the same level also the level of impact is\nthe same throughout the village. Each pod can be impacted different varying the\ncost of repairs. \n\n ",

            "reflection": "The role of\nrisk management in the game was to reduce the drawbacks caused by shocks when\nthe planet was hit by comets. The idea behind the game required the player to\npay attention to both its land development while at the same time preparing for\npossible losses through insurance and protection. The concept of risk\nmanagement behind the game meant finding the right balance between investing in\ndevelopment, gaining knowledge and paying for protection and insurance. Paying for\ninsurance and/or protection involved some drawback in terms of development in\nthe short run, but benefits were seen later in the game. At the beginning of\neach level the choice of investing either in development or in preparation for\nrisk had to be taken. By investing in development, I was able to lock in bigger\ngains both in money and in development level, but I was uncovered if risks occurred.\nIf I chose to prepare for risk, I had to spend my money on insurance and\nprotection and hold off on upgrading and building. In the early levels, when\nrisks were smaller, a good insurance acquired in the beginning made sure that I\nfinished the level, but later on, it became insufficient. \n\nI played\nthe game twice, but managed to reach only level 4 on both tries. I learned that\ndecisions have to be made quickly and that a balance between development and\npreparation for risk has to be found. Analyzing the two separately is not\nenough when possible risks are greater, even if it might work in more laid back\nconditions. I also learned that when risks can be greater, both insurance and\nprotection are required, especially the optimal use of the two. If I were to\nplay the game again I would try to think faster, make decisions quicker, and focus\nmore on protection, not just on acquiring an expensive insurance, but I would\nalso keep the insurance. In terms of development, if the damages were reduced,\nI think it would be enough to advance to new levels.\n\nAs a new\nimplementation in the game, I would make available the cost of protection, as\nit is stated for the different types of insurance. In this way, players could\nmake the decision in a calculated matter, and not randomly. In terms of\nchoosing the right path when pursuing risk management I thing calculating the\nestimated return is important when making choices and in a real environment I think\nthere would be time for some calculus when choosing the right balance between development,\nknowledge, protection and insurance. Because the cost of recovering from shocks\ncan not be estimated in other way than by looking at past events and history\nnever repeats identically, I consider it important to have a clear\nunderstanding of costs when it comes to preparing for risk. We cannot know the cost of recovering from shocks, but we can keep under control the costs of risk management. Besides that,\ncalculating the risk reward of paying for different type of preparation for\nrisk comes in handy when adapting a certain risk management path. We need to\nknow the short term drawbacks of every strategy and its long term benefits. ",

            "reflection": "Risk horizon essay\n\nThe goal of this\ngame is to succesfully manage risks in order to sustain the\ndevelopment of an off-world colony. Central to this theme comes the\nbalancing between knowledge about upcoming risks, protection against\nthem, and whether or not to get insured for potential costs\nassociated with the impact of these risks.\n\nKnowledge quickly\nbecomes a factor in the decision making throughout the game. Should I\nkeep investing in buildings, or hedge against potential disasters\ndown the road? More accurate and precise information about these\ndisasters lowers their severity and impact. This is achieved through\nlooking on the “horizon” of the colony world, to see the\nprobability of a specific threat occurring, when and also how severe they\nmight be. Risks that have a greater severity level than one's\nprotection level, are quickly identified and targeted for further\nresearch. \n\n\nOne's own protection\nlevel takes time to improve, and to succeed in the game you have to\nkeep this level reasonably high since it comes at a cost of further\ndevelopment. In the beginning these costs are high compared to their\nbenefit, since you are starting out with few resources. Later on you\nhave hopefully paid the cost to raise this level, and should a severe\nand highly likely threat arise, you can scale the protection level of\nyour colony to match this more evenly. This will in turn greatly\nreduce the impact of the threat, and even eliminate some of them. For sustained development a growing level of protection is needed. \n\n\nEarly on in the game\nthe disasters are unpreventable. A good way of dealing with them is\nthrough insurance. For a cheap cost, you can effectively protect\nyourself from up to 75% of the cost associated with rebuilding your\nwhole society, should a very big threat impact you. Since the\ndevelopment level is very low, the time to get back on one's feet is\nalso very low compared to later on in the game. Much like the farmers facing the threat of famines and poor crops in certain parts of our world, insurance allows you to take risk.\n\nA key learning point\nin this game is that paying for insurance and protection, allows you\nto invest a lot of your wealth in buildings or further development if you like. One of the reasons for\nthis is that you can more accurately estimate the downside of an\nupcoming disaster.  On the other hand, you will also find that the\nupside is also necessarily lower. Accepting the risks can be grueling\nat most, but also rewarding at best. \n\n\nThroughout the game\nit is an interesting thing to reflect on, that it's easy to grow\nrisk-averse in the later levels, as the stakes are high and the cost\nof disasters in resources and time to recover are higher. Coming from\na fairly safe and risk-free corner of the world, it's hard to imagine\naccepting risks of a magnitude like in this game.\n\n",

            "reflection": "In the RiskHorizon game I managed to achieve lvl 5. At the beginning of my play I was unable to win lvl 3, because of the lack of research of comets (I didnt find that option before). That proves, that there is no possibility to win without the developement of every area of risk management.While playing the game I tried to analyse the possibility of the comet hit and focus on the development and protection. Only after seeing the comet with very high severity I decided to buy the insurance (almost in every game - but after building some pots = faster development).In my opinion there are several main reflections after playing the game:1. It is very important to develop any field of protection in parallel to the development of business/society/infrastructure.2. Sometimes there is no chance to avoid defeat or an accident, but the succesful risk management provided with the rules from pt 1. could help in rebuilding prosperity.3. It is neccesary to analize the risks with exploration of the possibility of some accident. ",

A massive and ongoing investment on comets shocks prevention redounded to security for the island. After playing the game for the first time, I started investing in growing the community connections, preparing them to the comets shocks and raising the islands. Therewith, the damage due the hit was 0% and I didn`t have to invest in pods repairment.

            "reflection": "In the game, risk\nmanagement is all about confronting the risk, preparing for them and managing\nwith their effects. First of all, game strategy is developing the community\nwhile meeting many problems along the way. According to me, I chose to make\nmore and more pods to save the community from the harmful effects. But I also\ndid some compromises such as by taking the low budget insurance. In addition, I\nneeded more money for upgrading the pods. So, I decided to buy the normal\ninsurance policy. That will be helpful for achieving the goal. I think\nknowledge part was so much important for preparation of risk development.\n\nIn my point of view, when\nI played the game merely once I took some time to understand the rules and\nstrategies. Therefore, I was not able to finish the task in the first time. I had\nlack of information about the game. But\nwhen I tried it second time, I had understood the game policies. It was not as\nhard as it was first time. Playing any game for the first is a different sort\nof experience. We always need time and good knowledge about the game. If you follow\nthe rules in the right way then it is easy to catch and more chances to win the\ngame. When I played the game more than once I used the different tactics and\ntried not to do the same mistakes, which I had done on the first place. I\nlearned things that I would have used the resources on the right place. Apart\nfrom this I learned that time is most valuable commodity. In addition,\npreparation, knowledge and obtaining insurance to save the community from the\nharmful effects. But practice required for every game. All the things of risk\nmanagement such as knowledge, time and money are equally important in this\ncycle. \n\nFinally, Risk management is\nnot only restricted to controlling the threats and also reducing their negative\neffects. It also involves risk avoiding as well as risk taking. Every work had\ndifferent sort of risk. Sometimes, we avoid the risk but sometimes we take the risk.\nFirst, I would add things that help people to understand easily. I would add a\nwebpage and people browse through game instructions in detail. This kind of\nstrategy may seem little strange in the beginning but once people begin it will\nbe more effective and also surprise with the outcomes. ",

            "reflection": "What lessons have I learned from this game ?\nAfter plaing the Risk Horizon game, I learned some lessons, and I wish to make the following reflections about managing risk.\nFirst Lesson : Whether risk is imposed or taken on voluntarily, the impact of shocks can be amplified or reduced depending on people’s external environment, their internal conditions, and their risk management. Some people may be vulnerable—that is, especially susceptible to losses from negative shocks—as a result of their exposure, internal conditions, and risk management.\n\n Second Lesson : Risk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the ability to cope once a risk has materialized. Preparation (or ex ante risk management) includes a combination of three actions that can be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge, obtaining protection, and obtaining insurance.This is what is known as the interlinked components of risk management.\n\nThird Lesson: Protection and insurance can provide complementary means of managing risk\nProtection can decrease the likelihood of very severe losses, thereby increasing the probabi-lity of routine losses relative to extraordinary losses. \n\nFourth lesson :\nRisk management is cost-effective—yet not always feasible Not only can risk management save lives, avert damages, and unleash opportunities, but preparation for risk often has high returns. \n \nIf I were to play this game a second time, I will first focus on three main things. First knowledge of the type of risk ; then preparation in order to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits ; and finally I will insist on insurance so as to face  potential outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty.\nWhat change would I propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live? I will design a game that reflect the reality of my own context, that is focussing on risks that people may encounter in my own environment.\n",

            "reflection": "\n\nFirst of\nall, playing this type of game is not my cup of tea ... I find it rather\nenervating. However, I do understand that in order to win this game, you have\nto keep track of your financial situation, get as much knowledge as possible of\nthe risks surrounding you (i.e. the comets that might hit with no, slight or\nsevere damage), protect yourself (although I did not figure out which button I\nneeded to press here) – I guessed staying away from the coastline was wise in\norder not to be hit by the waves caused by the impact of the comets in the sea.\nBuying insurance seems a sensible option, but again this depends on how much\nmoney you can spend on it and whether it is important to build all the pods on\nall the foreseen building sites or whether one could live with the idea of only\nsetting up a few of them. I wanted to gain more knowledge but wasn't sure where to get it and I must admit the comets followed each other at a frightening speed which made me quite nervous. Keeping calm and acting swiftly also seem to be necessary for crisis management.\n\nThe first\ntime around I definitely spent too much money on insurance. So, the second time around I kept a closer eye on\nmy budget.\n\nIf I were\nto play it again, I would try to gain more knowledge and get protection at a decent level at a reasonable price, before\nbuying insurance coverage. These are exactly the three elements I have learned about basic RM in this game.\n\nIf I could change anything to the game, I would\nmake the protection options clearer and more visible: building a dam to stop\nthe waves from coming inland; installing rockets to shoot the comets to pieces;\nbuilding shelters to help evacuate people; investing in impact forecasting; … Finally, I guess for young people (or fans of video games) this game is self explanatory, for me it was a bit confusing, but I did get the gist.",

            "reflection": "In the game I assume the role of Managing Director of Risk Management having two fronts: Financial Management and Infrastructure Management, taking into account factors such as Investigations, Insurance and Protection. From the beginning I considered appropriate to pay the insurance premium that covers up to 75% while the spherical parallel modules installed. But I noticed that as trying to protect, bringing the field investigations were red; On the contrary, as he let the investigations grew monetary income increased, but neglected to pay attention to protection. I've played several times and I've learned was: 1. The importance of detailed knowledge levels and their potential risks. 2. Resources should be managed optimally to minimize the damage caused by falling meteors. 3. The above two points help to better design a comprehensive plan for risk management and decision making. What I would suggest adding a new version of the game would incorporate VISION. Just as there is information of each threat, you should also have information display last level or the development of each module to its highest level infrastructure. As in any design of a strategic plan, when part of a vision, we can better define the objectives, strategies, tactics and activities to be performed; what may be an incentive to drive better decisions.",

We can easily make the comparison with some\nregions of the Earth, such South Asia (Bangladesh and India for example) which\nundergoes every year major floods during the rainy season. These countries,\nwhich have a great potential for growth in the recent and large movement of\nglobalization, have to face multiple challenges about their risk management.\n\nDuring the\ngame, I have tried to growth my city as quickly as possible. Since collisions\nare often repeated, I have invested a lot in insurances by taking the 75 %\ncoverage. I was also spending a lot on protection by raising the level of the\nground. But there was a problem : my city was not growing enough fast because I\nwas missing money to build and improve my buildings, so I had to change my strategy\nafter level 2 by reducing insurance costs (past to 50 % coverage) and\nprotection costs(reduce the raising of the ground). \n\nThis game\nshowed me why some less developed countries cut in their risk management\n(protection, insurance and knowledge); because they are struggling to grow,\nthey will prefer to put much money as possible on their economic development, which\nthey believe to be more profitable. They will close their eyes on possible\ndisasters to save money. But when that disaster will happen, they will have to\npay high bills in repair, which will undermine their economic growth. I have\nalso seen that investing in good insurance and protection strategies is more\nprofitable when unfortunate event occurs; final costs are reduce and\nconsequently, major impacts on economic and development are avoided. But having\na good risk management strategy can become too expensive and slow economic development\n(as I have experienced after level 2). It’s why I think finding the right\nbalance between cheaper but good risk management policies and a reduced but\nsustained economic growth can be the best solution on a long-term, and even a\nmid-term basis. \n\nEven if\nthis game takes into principal account the interlinked components of risk\nmanagement (knowledge, protection and insurance), I think it should pay attention\non a  social  dimension. For example, it would be interesting\nto know the living conditions of the population, and how these conditions\nchange after each disaster (in occurrence an asteroid’s collision). Then, we\ncould act to try to ameliorate them. Also, we could have a bonus objective of\nreducing the number of dead (if there are) after each collision, by creating a\nprogram of learning about how to react to an asteroid’s collision and implanting\na system to warn people of the approach of the large rock, for example. Thereby,\nwe would have to confront an additional challenge in term of knowledge. ",

            "reflection": "In the Risk Horizon game, risk management was used to make the community\nof Alora prosper. You had to reach a delicate balance between researching the\ncomets (knowledge), elevating the island (protection), buying insurance and developing\nthe community. There were also measures of coping by connecting the glowing\ndots in the aftermath of a comet. When I first played the game, I easily reached level 2, but then\nstruggled a bit to move on. The game made it impossible for me to reach a\nperfect situation where I could be as protected as possible, fully insured, and\nthen develop. I had to trade off the feeling\nof safety afforded by a lot of protection and insurance in order to reach the\ndevelopment goals.  It was a clear lesson\nin priorities and how they might need to shift over time. For example, as I got\nbetter and reached level 4, balancing \nreparations and protection got in the way of upgrading the pods, because\nI did not have time to do it and revert to “green” before I was hit with\nanother comet and/or close to out of money. The more I played, the more\nI learned that I needed to actually take more risks; I would easily pass the 2\nfirst levels, where community development was somewhat minimal and the focus\ncould be on researching the comets. But as soon as I reached higher levels\nwhere the community needed to thrive on top of being protected, I would lose\nbalance and end up “in the red”. Therefore, I tried to focus more on\ndevelopment, and got a bit further.\n\nIf I look at the game from the standpoint of\nmanaging risk in Montreal, Canada, I would add a cost to maintain older\nstructures as the game goes on. This is very closely linked to the game, as it\nrelates to developing community and making sure it thrives. All factors of the\ngame are important in the situation of Montreal, but could represent less\ntangible, natural disaster-like risks. Indeed, Montreal might not be on the\npath of important natural disasters, but its road infrastructures have become a\nrisk in recent years, with some unfortunate accidents (for example, an overpass\nthat fell down and made victims, a solar protection detaching in a tunnel…) and\nvery large structures in need of replacing (for example, the Champlain Bridge,\nwhich was deemed in need of immediate measures and complete replacement). The\ngame could represent this situation, as the city has continued to develop and\nprosper, but would need the added task of dealing with failing infrastructures\nand the risk and costs they represent.",

            "reflection": "Game ReflectionThe role was to provide me -the administrator- strategies: based\non knowledge, protection, insurance and the coping ability of my\ncommunity. The tradeoffs I was experimenting with were a few: until I\nrealized the strengths and weaknesses of each of them. My first option was based on the decision to build a community of 6 pods, but they suffered a lot, and\nthe funds available were not sufficient to improve the structures and\nthe resistance capacity of each of them. So then I went in the\nopposite direction; I decided to build a maximum of 2 in order to\nrealize what were the advantages the structures will present every\ntime I improve them, but at attempt 3 or 4 I realize that\nthe community connections were suffering because of the minimum\nnumber of pods, so I increase the number to 4, and it was then when\nthe community connections help a lot. But overall the most important\nchoice was to perform a constant research on the meteorites, this\nwas making the community stronger. The one choice I always decided\nto go with, in fact it was my very first move; was to purchase\ninsurance. The protection option which was to rise the level of the\ncommunity was the one I used the less, not because it was not\nimportant, but because I realized it was the less effective in terms\nof offering the best results.The ways in which preparation for risk affected the development of the community were definitively in the amount of pods builded. I was scare not to be able to improve these structures into a stronger point, were they would not suffer as much after a possible impact. I played the games several times, I started by building a very\nsmall community, and to concentrate a lot of my funds in developing, but then i realized that research and improvement of structures were key aspects of a successful attempt. I made changes with every attempt, the most important one was the decision to but increase the number of\npods, because the funds were growing with the continuos research and\nI was able to improve the structure of the pods to make them more\nresistant to impact. My final attempts were based on a community of 4\npods, with every attempt I realized how important was the constant\nresearch and the insurance. I learned from the game that knowledge is\nfundamental because it will provide us with valuable information not\njust on prevention but on  coping and reacting with the consequences.\nThe one constant option on all of my attempts was the insurance, in\nfact that was my very first step as soon as the funds were available.I would probably have the option to create two different\ncommunities, in order to experiment different strategies and evaluate\nthe results, this option will most likely be provided only for the\nfirst two attempt , then the player will have a clear idea of what\nstrategy to follow, and the player will only continue with 1 community. I believe this option will be very beneficial at the time of comparing the possible consequences of the several strategies the player will be trying out, but if the option to change the game has to be directly related to the place I live, there will have a to be a option with; again two different communities, but this time the goal will not be to compare strategies, but to realize that each community has very different resources, and how this play a fundamental role at the time of prevention, research, better structures and coping with a consequences.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management helps confront risk by predicting how much damage comet will cause (knowledge), leaving you with the option of seeking protection and insurance to help absorb the severity eventually when shock occurs. Therefore, risk management assists to prepare and confront risk through adequate knowledge, protection and  seek insurance so as to ameliorate severe impact.I discovered that the more time one spends on Research of a comet, the more knowledgeable you are about the degree of protection one ought to facilitate and the more time you have for community connection. Also, the more time you spend on protection the slower your development achievement : although matching protection level to the comet's severity helps the drastic consequences of risk. Seeking insurance on the other hand, becomes imminent after Research is made about the magnitude of impact a comet will cause when it eventually occur, especially when you observe the fast pace at which comet will occur. Therefore, spending time on gathering knowledge about a comet galvanises your preparation while maintaining a balance on protection and seek insurance eventually with a meticulous attention on upgrading pods and developing new ones, taking into consideration time and resources.  The quest to ameliorate the impact of a comet (research, protection and insurance) to an extent prevents you from upgrading, building new pods etc that aid faster development, which eventually affects community connection.2) I would spend more time researching, being time conscious and maintain a relatively moderate protection that matches a comet and seek insurance when comet's severity tendency of a hit is high. I would ensure a balanced trade-off among knowledge, insurance and protection while maintaining a faster community development with a green meter.The game has taught me that Risk is inevitable but controllable with proper risk management. Resources are limited and as such must be prudently put to priorities as much as Time waits for no one!But with adequate and proper knowledge, Protection and insurance, shock caused by risk will be significantly reduced.3) In the game I feel the risk component being captured are very relevant to my community except for access to insurance which is in the hands of private sector,  and not easily accessible by a common man. The community where I live is characterised by illiteracy: awareness of the danger of risk and it's negative consequences must be meticulously carried out.Lastly, in the game, the impact of a comet holistically affected all the communities while in a real life scenario, some areas are more prone to risk  and others not affected even in the same community. In essence, the research component should include an indicator that would tell which particular area in a community is likely to be affected.",

            "reflection": "When I started the game honesty I was a little confuse in\nhow to play, it is because I am not good game player, however when I continue I\ncould understand that be in the game is absolutely easy. Nevertheless reflecting\nand giving the scenario to the reality I realize the complexity of risk\nmanagement.  In this course I have learned the importance of have a good\nplan to prevent risk and not only have a good saving to use when the event is coming.\nIn the game I played more than twice, at the beginning I just cover with the minimum,\nand with this hedge I thought will be fine. The result was not. The second time\nI played 50 percent even with this hedge was not enough. Finally I played with\nthe 75 percent the damages got better.Continue with the idea about, the damages got better, and at\nthe same time mention that I already mention in the first paragraph, be in the\ngame is absolutely easy, because you just have to increase the amount, and that\ndoes not cost anything for you. The complexity here is be in full action, maybe\nwith lack resources in one country with high corruption, with weak institutions,\nor with a record of irresponsibility from the company that offer insurance.Playing the game I thought I never like to be in one\nsituation like this, but at the same time come through my mind situation that\nyou cannot control, like natural disaster, financial crisis, accident, etc. absolutely\nthe best option is be protected. But why I thought I never like to be in one\nsituation like that, because I thought about developing countries/poor countries\nthat do not have the organizational structure, the resources etc. In this course I am learning about how to prevent the risk\nin many way, for example searching information, in case I am exposed to some\nkind of disease, between other things, and I am impressed how in my real live I\nhave never consider to check some information when I moved for a new place. But\nin other hand my worry is about poor countries which are the more and probably\nthe most exposed to risk because their situation. However one point very important to consider is the good\nresult of risk management in many countries with high risk of naturals disaster\nfor example and how they have achieve to reduce the amount of victim, just for\ncite a case. I understood the importance of create resilience, be prepare\nto face the situation, but at the same time I end my reflection with a little\nsadness for the countries that continue exposed to the higher risk with the lower\nincome, probably the higher risk is live the life exposed to a food shock.The challenge to all human being around the globe is be prepare\ncreate plan of contingence in one world in an accelerate change procuring take\nadvantage of the entire situation to win or to get experience to prevent future\nevent. One idea could be that developing countries without\nexperience ask information from countries with more experiences in how to be prepared\nto create resilience and educate the society to be set to face any kind of\nevent that put in danger the natural life style of the people in every community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are all expose to risk without exception; I just hope one\nday the most vulnerable have access to save their future in one way more\naccessible. ",

            "reflection": "Role of risk management in the game is able to minimize the risk in achieving our goals. As we did before, when he first played the game above, we are still wondering and identify how to implement this game. So do I just directly, by pressing the \"exercise\" after a look instruction from the game. I need to follow the \"exercise\" to train the same circumstances as the game actually happened later. So I read the related materials science, insurance, and protection first. After that game rehearsal, and after all was done, I immediately implement actual game. I played game more than once. I intend to achieve better results than the previous results. But it seems to me less successful plays this game. I only pass on level 1. Fact,  I couldn't upload the result because until now I could not do it. I tried many times but still can not do this.If I could propose changes to better represent an important risk management options in where I live, I will try to develop aspects of risk management by developing the capacity of human resources first. Case that I want to raise in this essay, for example floods that occurred in Jakarta, Indonesia. In the case of floods in Jakarta, the role of risk management is essential to minimize the risk of a catastrophic flood that would cause physical or moral loss for residents affected by the flooding. There are several ways that can be done to deal with the floods, according to the three key components of risk management, namely knowledge, insurance, and protection itself. The key component of \"knowledge\" is described by increasing knowledge parties interested in the problems of the flood. Government as policy makers what the proper handling, such as increasing the volume of the Ciliwung river dredging in a way so that it can accommodate more rainwater overflow so that flooding can be prevented even further. Society should also increase environmental knowledge in this regard, by way of example not throw garbage in the gutters, which will block the flow of water so as to cause waterlogging and flooding. The second component is \"insurance\", for example by providing insurance for those affected, both life insurance, health insurance, property insurance as well as insurance for damage caused by flooding and high water pressure. Given the expected risk of losing insurance would be at least a thing or minimize the negative impact of floods. The third component is the protection. With the shelter refugees eg infrastructure like building where they planned to evacuate before the negative effects of floods can be minimized. These three components, namely knowledge, insurance, and protection as contained in this course material can be applied in the handling of floods which will be expected to minimize the risks and negative consequences that appear relatively less than before. It is not easy to overcome the problem of floods, because lot of obstacles that may later be blocked, for example incentives, information, behavior, and limited resources. With the amount of incentives and the right to private levels, the social impact of the development can be minimized and environmental aspects remain to be addressed. With the information provided accurately and on time, then the flood disaster can be realized. Information flooding in a point, then it will quickly spread to other places that will lead to early treatment in anticipation of the flood disaster. With alacrity behavior and aware of the possible disasters that may arise, the casualties can be reduced and the anticipation of an emergency medical handlers can be implemented more quickly.",

            "reflection": "            The role of risk management in the game was to show that  as people in the community, we have to share risks in order to overcome the dangers that might strike in the future. This can be done through combining and balancing the components of knowledge, protection andinsurance. Hence, risk is a powerful tool for development.             The choices i had to make were to first of all, consider the time factor since it is a valuable resource and never gained when lost. As a community we can never know when disaster might strike so to be on a safer side and reduce the impact,  it is better to balance knowledge, protection and insurance with the time factor at the back of the mind. This is essential in a community because when disaster strikes, few repairs are made due to balanced and adequate preparation.             I confronted the tradeoff in terms of knowledge by not wasting a lot of time researching especially for those comets which were approaching faster. Therefore i had to instead focus on ensuring heavy  protection and insurance were adequate.At times protection was expensive especially where the community was progressing in development. therefore it was better to do a little more research and insure as well as access the impact of the problem because repair  would be done. Since insurance would be very expensive as the commmunity developed,the tradeoff made was to sensitize the community about the outcome of any disaster.             Preparation for risk affected development immediately in a way that it was cheaper and easier to balance knowledge, insurance and protection.When people in the community are few and resources available, it is easier to curb any impending dangers which might strike hard. After playing the game for the first time,i ensured that  a healthy and vibrant community  should  be created with maximum protection and insurance so that when disaster struck, few repairs would be required.            What i learned  from the game was that protection and insurance resources raised as development increased within the community. Disaster would strike at any minute when one of the two was inadequate  so to avoid too much severity, research had to be done. so these components go hand in hand so that at the end of it all, the community is able to cope with the aftereffects.          The risk management choice that i would propose to in the place that i live would be knowledge. Many people within the area are not well informed with the effects and after effects of a disaster. where there is ignorance, people perish so it is a silent killer. without  knowledge people are left in uncertainty and confusion when disasters strike. they are stuck in a confined place since they do not have any resources to cover the damage and cope afterwards. Hence, knowledge would matter in the place that i live.",

Game also taught me how we can deploy the available\nresources by having knowledge of future risk and its severity and probability\nof facing it. It also taught me the trade-off we have to make in order to\nprepare and cope after a calamity. I traded off developing less no of colonies\nwith purchasing broad insurance cover, as after getting hit by a comet the cost\nand time to redevelop a colony was higher. So having less no of colonies to\nbuild after getting hit by a comet gave me flexibility of redeveloping hit\ncolonies by having more cash to pay for redevelopment.\n\nDuring the game I acquired knowledge about the chances of\nhitting and severity of the hit of a comet, this helped me in increasing my\nprotection and opting for a proper insurance plan. I learned how acquiring\nknowledge helps in risk management by opting for a protection, choosing a\nproper insurance plan and in coping. \n\nIf given a choice I would like to include in the game of\nhaving knowledge of time to rebuilt the damage colonies and time taken in\nupgrading the colonies from a level to another, as this will give me better\nknowledge to develop how many colonies and which colonies to upgrade under\ncertain time frame. As we had a limited time to develop and sometime I faced\nchallenge in selecting between colonies to upgrade and colonies to develop.\n\n",

            "reflection": "     Risk Horizon was very interactive and educational, helping me understand how to manage risk under wealth and time constraints while at the same time developing the island of Alora. The role of risk management here was to prevent and lessen the costs of repairing damage caused by the comets hitting Alora. This was done through research, protection, insurance, and community connections. During the game, I had to make several choices, including whether to spend my wealth on upgrading existing pods or developing new pods, whether to spend my limited time on protection or research, and whether to take a chance and develop/upgrade a pod or wait until the comet attack is over. Some trade-offs I made were balancing research with protection and protection with insurance. Preparation for risk affected development in several ways. First, whenever I spent money on protection, the bar's color would turn redder, meaning that my development wasn't going well. However, protection, research, insurance, and community connections also prevented and lessened the damage of the comet attacks, benefiting development.      I played Risk Horizon several times. After the first time, I took more chances in developing and upgrading pods, as I realized that only that helped fill the bar. I also took more time to research, as that helped reduce damage from comet attacks.There were several things I learned from this game. First, I learned that managing risk is every bit as important as developing. Second, I learned that if not consciously worked on for some amount of time, things such as protection get downgraded. Third, it is worth the time to do extensive research, as data becomes more accurate as you spend more time researching it. Fourth, insurance greatly reduces the costs of repairing damage and thus is beneficial to coping. Lastly, I learned that despite so many comet attacks, my end goal is still to develop the island, so I must take chances to develop and upgrade pods.     If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would like to change many things to make it more realistic. However, limited to only one thing, I must choose. In California (where I live), we are especially prone to earthquakes. However, unlike in Risk Horizon, we cannot see the earthquakes coming with our naked eyes. We must use all kinds of advanced technology to sense them the slightest bit. In fact, we even have specialists that do just that, and they get payed for it. As a better representation of the risk management choices that matter in the place I live, instead of being able to see the comets in plain view and getting free research, there should be something along the lines of a comet detector/specialist in the corner of the view port that you have to pay for to get research. Comets should be seen just seconds before they crash. This change makes the game much more realistic.",

I\nrealized that if I spent more on making and upgrading pods, I would be more\nlikely to have greater loss when hit by the comets. When you sustain damage\nfrom comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if I\nspent more on preparation for risk, I would not have enough money to develop\nthe community, which was required to pass the level. I had to stick to the\nbalance policy, having limited resources there was a tension of making decision\nbetween spending on risk management or to spend on other development\npriorities.

            "reflection": "Reflection on the game\n\nThe game demonstrated how knowledge (research), protection, insurance and coping (building community connections) help mitigate and cope with risk. It also provoked an assessment of the  trade-offs to be taken when making decisions regarding risk management – especially in cases when resources are constrained. For example – does one invest in infrastructure (housing/ pods or broad protection) or does one invest in insurance? The game also made me choose between investing precious time in research or spending time in other activities such as building/ development, buying insurance or developing protection.\n\nThe more prepared I was for an event – through research, protection and by having insurance – the better I withstood the events. The community links were stronger and I was able to build on the community links after an event. This, together with insurance meant that the damage I sustained was much less when hit by a severe meteor. It also cost less to invest in broad societal protection, low insurance and research (which 'cost time') than paying for high insurance. I was finally able to advance higher in the game when I paid less for higher insurance and put more money into development (by spending more on pods) and by increasing protection for society (to prevent the negative event). The rewards or benefits were higher for reducing risk for society as a whole and developing it than for trying to deal with the consequences of a negative event. \n\nI did better when I had a higher level of development. Income was higher when I had more pods and when I had invested more in the pods. This generated more income for me and society prospered.\n\nI was able to gain more time to build community connections after I was struck by an event when I had spent more time researching an event. When I had more time building community connections after being struck by a negative event, the damage was often less severe. This was not only beneficial in terms of sustaining less damage, but it also helped in that I was able to focus on developing my island and preparing for other negative shocks.\n\nA lesson I learned was that the solution is not found in any one component, and that trade-offs are constantly being made in a changing context and under time constraints. This means that risk management practitioners have to be constantly analysing risks and opportunities, as well as changing obstacles to addressing or acting upon those risks and opportunities.\n\nI had played the game a few times and I tried a number of strategies to ensure success. However, I found that the game, like life, is somewhat unpredictable. I did find increased success with more development, research and more community connections. The game also highlighted the obstacles facing risk management. For example, time pressure made it more difficult to choose and undertake activities. \n\nIf I had to change on thing in the game to better capture one thing that captures risk management where I live, I would add a component to differentiate according to class and gender. Where I live, poor people and women are significantly worse affected by risk shocks than rich people and they take longer to recover. The game could demonstrate this by, for example, showing some pods being worse affected than others and taking a longer period to rebuild. Pods could also be different colours to show different genders.",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection: \n\nIn the course of playing the game\nI learned a few things about risk management:\n\nThe planet Alora is one that is\nprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one that\ncan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen the\nimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect the\nplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:\nDue to limited resources like time and money. We had to make various decisions\nthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming comets\nwere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the comet’s\nseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as research\ntime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take action\nto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,\nit can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level of\nprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect the\nplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance and\ndevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching a\nhigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In the\nbeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and using\nthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase in\nfinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way that\nit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance and\nprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actually\nlessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances of\nhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet through\nobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according to\nthe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not cause\ntoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protect\nAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role in\nreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one has\nto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower the\ncosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on the\nphysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutive\ntime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better that\nis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I would\npropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to the\ncontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relatively\nfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given this\nsituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions with\nlimited and slower growing financial resources.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1. Role of the Risk management Game; The role of the risk management game was objectively introduce how one would use resources available to take preventive measures against shock. This involved learning how to conduct research to gather necessary information on severity, probability of occurrence of risk, and what action to take in the event that the risk occurs. It helps in the understanding of the various component of risk management i.e. protection, information, insurance and copying.Knowledge - information helps in understanding the shocks, external environment conditions thus helping reduce uncertaintyProtection - helps reduce the probability and size of losses and increases the benefitsInsurance - helps transfer resources across people and overtime, from good to bad states of natureCoping - helps recover from losses and make the most out of benefits2. Yes, i played the game more than once and each time i made sure that i got enough information about the magnitude of the quack, repaired and upgraded the ponds, took more insurance and matched my protection level with the expected severity of the risk. This i did without loosing site on the available resources. The first time i took the game i did not go past stage 1, but the more i took the game i realized that every time the earth quack occurs, the next try i would take more measures to minimize the lossesI learnt about taking insurance, matching my protection with the \nanticipated risk, and also developing and preparing the community using \nthe resources i had at my disposalI learnt how to balance between the growing community and preparing for the potential shocksi learnt that it is important to check the probability of shock happeningI have learnt that every action taken to mitigate shock cost moneyIt is important to consider time it will take until shock occurs3. I would introduce some aspects of coping - either through evacuation when the risk is eminent. I would  put in objects to represent human beings. ",

            "reflection": "Reflection 1:The game was challenging for me to play. I got to level 2. Risk management in the game was researching incoming asteroids and assessing what to do next; buy insurance, keep building or protect my investment. I tried a variety of options in trying to past levels. At first, I bought the highest insurance right away.  I was researching and building, I would only protect a little bit because I was afraid of the green line turning red. I would pass level one and not be prepared in level two for back to back severe impact asteroids.  I felt compelled to buy the best insurance coverage.I tried protecting for a whole minute in level one to build up two bars. I would build after the first minute and research only slightly. I purchased insurance only when there was immediate threat of impact.  This approach did not help raise the green bar to the level needed to pass level one very often and when I did move forward to level two I would not pass.I did notice while researching until the asteroid when down and missed that researching often helped to reduce severity of the hit or the possibility of hitting.  Juggling to maintain building while researching limited my ability to protect. On one hand researching asteroids helped raise my green bar faster than protecting.  By the third night of me trying to understand the balance I discovered that protecting when the asteroid was not threat did help raise my green bar faster when compared to when there is a dangerous asteroid and I protect my green bar turns red and does not move.  This helped me to understanding the timing of my actions.  Protecting while building with no immediate threat was good risk management.  When an asteroid was dangerous, researching became the action needed for risk management, learning as much as I could and often helping to reduce severity or the likelihood of impact. I did not build double tier buildings in an successful level completion.  My buildings were all first or second stage development.I did start to notice something when the asteroid would hit.  Those critically few seconds of connecting the yellow dots was the communication amongst my buildings and property. I often found that adequate research and protecting while connecting as many sites as possible often lead to little to no damage.Due to a mandatory work trip without internet access I could not continue to play.  This game did stress me out because losing level two meant starting at level one and I never did the same strategy twice.  I felt this game was addicting because it was challenging and yet I knew it was trying to teach me valuable lessons.  I felt defeated in my inability to grasp onto what risk balance I needed to attain to pass beyond level two.",

            "reflection": "Risk management's role in the city of Alora was to help reduce the developing city's vulnerability by implementing the measures needed to make Alora more resilient while it develops to its full potential.  As the city grew the more protection and insurance it needed.  Now that came at a cost.  The trade off was while in the process of acquiring knowledge about the risk, you would be confronted with gaining the right amount of protection and insurance which at the same time would put research and development on a halt, and all three came at a cost whether it be financial or time wise.  Preparing for risk affected the development process in that  (1) preparation came at a cost and as a result sometimes there was not enough money and time between the hazards to continue with developing the city.  (2) As the risk increased so did the cost of development and risk management. Played this game more than once.  What was done differently was that the city was not developed too quickly, more time was spent on research, and acquired the best insurance from onset.What was learnt from this game was (1) knowledge is key, yet you need to balance when is the right  time to do so without risking too much (2) each hit from the hazard decreased your protection and cost you time and money to rebuild (3) time and cost is a factor in research, development, protection and insurance (4) the frequency between events left the city vulnerable, it limited the time needed to do research, acquire protection even when insurance with the best coverage was purchased, or develop at the rate one desired.  Too much of a rapid development hindered time and money to acquiring knowledge.  Sometimes concentrating on one factor such as protection, lost time and money and did not give enough time to gather the knowledge about the hazard, which still left the city vulnerable.  In the end there must be enough time and money for development and risk management.  There is no perfect balance between risk management and effects of the risk.  However, having implemented all factors of risk management decreases the effects of the hazard.  Yet having frequent hazards increases your vulnerability because you have not had enough time or funds available to strengthen your resilience from the last  event.  So why risk management when even though the city implements all factors of risk management, it is still left picking up the pieces especially if the frequency of the hazards are so close together?  Money, having some is better than having none at all.  Insurance will cover at least 75% of rehabilitation.  When residents of the city see that policies were put in place, development shows progress towards restoration, it fortifies the residents, gives them hope and most times will encourage majority (not all) at least those who can afford to, to learn and build their own resilience.  But what about the poor and vulnerable who cannot afford insurance and the vulnerable areas?  Risk management -  if the research is done properly, then the city should know where the first places to implement the mitigation measures.What to change about the game, nothing because it is a game not reality,  but as a platform in showcasing risk management, then add people, because people bring dynamics.",

            "reflection": "Mostly, it's only when you see danger coming that you realise the need to protect yourself from the shock. The role of risk management made clear that if you don't protect yourself through gaining knowledge of the chance and the severity of the comet hitting, your work on developing your buildings will suffer proportionally to the missing knowledge, protection and insurance. Of course, you can't always have all you want. That's why your rate of development decreases for a period of time, in order to pay for the insurance (I usually bought the insurance at the beginning of the game. 2nd level - 25%, 3rd level -50%, 4-5 - 75%), and increasing your protection. But the outcomes of such a temporary loss are greater than their neglecting. I can't compare the superiority of either insurance or protection, since I played only 1 game; but I can say that for me, insurance was on the second plan, even though I bought it first. I didn't want to risk the huge damage a severe comet would cause for developing 1 or 2 building. I'm sure it would've cost me much more in the end. And so, I put my emphasis on protection. Even though it diminishes your rate of development, when a comet hits, the damage done is less than without protection, or even none, and the money difference from a 50% and 5% can then be reinvested in developing your buildings, buying better insurance, and/or improving your current level of protection. I guess the incentive to get through as many levels as you can, pushes you to risk in favour of the development. I thought of strategising my actions as follow. As long as a comet didn't have a 40+ chance of hitting and severeness of 3 bars, I continued developing, knowing that my insurance and protection are more than enough to have no damage, or subsequently very little reparation. But if the comet had a very high level of severeness, even with a small chance of hitting, I worked on protection, knowing that even if it doesn't hit now, so I will be both prepared in advance and having the opportunity to develop the building without losing anything when the next one came. I can therefore say that thinking ahead and rationalising that the cost you pay now, will save you more than 100% of the money invested plays a key role on how people approach risk management.I have no guesses what I would've done differently, because my strategy allowed me to receive 10/10 points from the first try. Therefore I would have to play the game more times, applying different strategies, cutting off the ones that don't work, because with every level you can adopt a new plan, and so there are tens of strategies to chose between.For the place I live in, I would add one thing. I would put the number of people that inhabit that planet or living in those houses. The number would rise, the more developed a house is. This would give the player more responsibility and he can attribute the losses of lives to the real life, where such things happen everyday. By that I hope that the player will pay more attention to insurance and protection, seeing that lives depend upon him (even though imaginary ones). He will also realise that one type of damage does not affect only a specific group of people, but every single one (systemic risk), realising that you must act not only when it affects you, because you will also need help later.",

            "reflection": "Essay about the Risk Horizon Game.\n\n\n \n\nBy: Juan David Arenas\nBermúdez.\n\n \n\nThe Risk Horizon Game challenged players to develop an\nassigned village. To achieve this development it was required an important\nbalance with an exact proportion of the components we are working on the\ncourse:  Knowledge (got it by the\nresearch, it let us know about shocks and reduce uncertainty), Protection (to\nminimize the size and probability of losses) and Insurance (to back up the\ndevelopment we had reach in the moment). Also copying (the last component) was\nnecessary when the meteorites hit. I believe this balance was the role of risk\nmanagement in the game, without the RM concepts things could get complicated\nsince the start and this could have been reflected in the tradeoffs during each\nlevel. \n\n \n\nChoices have to been fast and profitable, because time\nand money are also influential keys (or obstacles, according as you looked it)\nfor development. They even, for me, are part of that suitable combination or\nbalance target previously mentioned. These decisions also were mainly aimed to\nknowledge tool to know the severity of the problems and what sub-decision was\nconvenient to make. However, like in real life, you cannot neglect the\ndevelopment of the locality for being busy just researching, just protecting or\nbuilding, etc… (I mean, agents can't focus all the forces just in one tool)… So\nthe best option is combining: while you research the problems (meteorites in\nthis case), you should also begin the relevant constructions (pods’ built) or\nbuy some convenient insurance (especially if you would deal probably with\nsystematic risks).\n\n \n\nDuring the times I tried the game (3 times), I changed\nmy strategy: I started to research more and protect a little bit less,\nconsidering that firstable I had to know which was the problem to face,  in order to confront it; and secondable, that\nit allowed me to save more money.\n\n \n\nI learnt the importance of making decisions trusting\nin your capacities and looking for efficiency. They weren’t bad or good\ndecisions, they were just decisions, but while you integrate the topics that\nhave been learned (in this case, RM theory) it becomes easier to advance and\nthese new sets of decisions are more efficient, allowing you to get benefits after\nhaving faced the risk (in this case, reach the next level was the reward). This\nefficiency is also achieved when you manage your resources well, in this case\ntime and money. When you don’t warrant its proper use, they become obstacles,\nas I had previously mentioned on paragraph two.\n\n \n\nFinally, if I have to add a new aspect or fact in the\ngame to deal with, based on the place i live (Medellin, Colombia), it would be\nillegal payments known as “vaccines”, which are payments made by people with\nown business (even big companies) to gangs or some criminals sporadically. In\ncase the person denies to the pay, retaliation is taken by the collectors; so a\npercentage of the entrepreneurs decide to better pay it, while another\npercentage request help to the authorities. This is a hard phenomenon to\ncontrol because some gangs have too much power in here. In the game context,\nthere would be a kind of thieves or gang that often takes a little part of the\nmoney you have.",

            "reflection": "This game was very difficult for me to start playing and figure out. I was only able to reach level two and it took me 6 ttys to reach level 4. You had to be very care and make sure you where protected and also did your research on asteroids. This game taught me that you can never be to careful when buying protection for yourself. In the end I figured out that I needed insurance and research in order to win, where as in the beginning I thought it was very trivial. If I was to try this game again I would make sure to purchase everything I needed to be safe first, except for the first round because the chance of damage is very low due to the low risk of level one. The key point that I took away from the game were how protection is key as well as research. You can't have enough of any and that applies to the real world as well. I need to protect myself from outside forces such as natural disasters by purchasing insurance on things like cars, homes and then buy health insurance as well. I think it is very important to be prepared and protected in every area of your life. This is because in todays age the unexpected happens daily.If I where to add a piece to the game to make it better I would defiantly add earth quakes. Being reminded yesterday of how earthquakes can rattle cites and disrupt life. The earthquake that happened in Guatemala was a reminder to all of us living on faults that it can happen any time.In conclusion, this game has given me a broader understanding of how immanent danger may not seem to scary now but when you are faced with it in the future you will be thinking why didn't I just protect myself. If that means moving or buying insurance its up to you but the most important thing is to always be safe. I believe the premise of this game allows us indirectly see how things can affect and disrupt our lives very quickly. Now its up to you to protect yourself, your family and your belongings, make sure to do it in the smartest way possible and all will be fine. Never forget that danger is lurking in the waters.",

            "reflection": "The game is a very simplistic reflection on risk management and shows that there are several issues related to a situation. It shows that you have to make choices, indeed, and I found myself more focussing on the protection and not so much on the insurance and knowledge. It was interesting that on the higher levels however, also the insurance became necessary because there were more and more higher risks of getting hit. I was mostly assured by the effect that protection has: it is an investment that you do in the beginning with a long term effect that is relevant also for future risks. The knowledge is only relevant for that particular risk and therefore less efficient. The insuarnce again is long term although its coverage changes depending on the development of the locality.\nThe first time I played, I did not know what the research did to the possibility of reducing the effect of a hit, so that helped the second time. I also improved on building faster because without that the level can not be concluded. It became quite easy to reach the higher levels once I found out what the best strategy was. \nI think it is a bit too simple. I would rather keep level one as it is but instead of increasing the number of comets in the higher level, I would prefer to increase the complexity, for example by forcing to make more choices based on the costs (there was not much limit in spending in the game that I played) and considering relocation or different types of protection. Another type of risk could also be interesting to have to deal with because often places have multiple issues and have different ways to protect against them. \nIn the place I live, protection and preparation would be the main actions to migitate. Preparation in order to cope better is not part of the game, but would also  be relevant. Lastly, social, political, cultural factors are not taken into account. \nAltogether, I think the game gives a nice impression but it is too much simplified which makes it look too easy. It is like other computer games, I guess, that do not reflect the reality.",

            "reflection": "The game “Risk Horizon”\nhas a propulsive structure for risk management in terms of the appearances and control\nof: shocks as the effect of damages; internal conditions as the pod status,\ninsurance and , protection controls; various type of comets as representing the\nexternal environment; achievement of levels as the outcome of the whole\nmanagement.  Accordingly, the role of\nrisk management in the game is to help grow a sustainable environment in a\nhealthy way.  The decisions I made during\nthe game were basically the key components of risk management: knowledge,\nprotection, insurance, and coping. To clarify, I was able to understand the prediction\nof shocks by observing the comets’ severity and hitting chances as I controlled\nmy internal resources to reduce the uncertainty such as researching and\nprotection. Moreover, the trade-offs while I was protecting my pods were\nresearching and developing/ building pods or vice versa. Therefore, as I kept\nexpanding and developing my pods I observed the external conditions (comets) and\ntook the most relevant action according to the severity and chances of the\ncomet to hit. Furthermore, when I realized the high possibility of a comet to\nhit I invested on insurances and increased my protection. However, the\npreparation for risk affect development did not propound an immediate response;\nincreasing the protection bar needed too much time and the more protection I\nhad the more I could cope with the risks of damages. Thus, I personally would say that having a long term\nview was the most important feature of the game. \n\nBefore playing the game\nI obtained the instructions from the tutorial, in other terms this was the\ninformation that I needed for my incentives. Moreover, if I could call this an\nincident happened in other territory, this was my opportunity to manipulate the\noutcomes. If I were to play the game more than once I could probably do a\nbetter cost-benefit analysis whilst I control the trade-offs; by this means I\ncould manage measuring the predictions more consciously. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was one of compromise, adaption, and interpreting the cost-benefit of different resource allocations.  You had meteors coming, of what size you barely knew, and you needed to spend that money as best you can, all while allocating the proper time and dollars on research.  When you prepare for risk, that’s money and resources you can’t commit to development.  And when you develop, it’s more expensive to prepare for risk.  You also have to consider liquidity, or stores of money, as you need to preserve some of that for future expenditures, both in terms of investment and paying for damage (with or without insurance).Judging by my only reaching level three, I’m not sure I can say I truly got what the proper balance was.  What I did pull out of the game was the importance of that balance, and the difficulty of finding it.  I kept tinkering with my reliance on insurance, building, and research and a could never find the right mix.  I really liked the idea of social preparation, but how that reacted with research I could figure out.  It was an odd salad, is what I’m saying. I ’m sure I would have, with time, gotten their eventually.  I suppose it’s all just ongoing progress, though.  Funny because in real life there is no ‘beating’ the risk management game.Obviously, solidifying your infrastructure and insuring against losses is a question of opportunity cost: since building your buildings tall makes repairing them more expensive, the value of the more expensive insurance plans, relative the other costs, increases.  I imagine I could have perfected this for all four variables, finding the correct balance, but I’m not sure I understood the relationship of the raising the platform and research had.  I sort of just randomized those to see which was best.If I wanted the game to better represent real life choices, I’d want the every ten attempts or so to get ruined regardless of how well you played the game.  Or, at least, I’d add a simple mechanism for reacting to an external set of pods, one in which their actions alter the proper balance of your variables.  Additionally, adding the ability to take on debt would be a fun twist.  You could borrow money to really solidify your circumstances, or even just to develop, but then if you needed the money paid back and something went wrong, you’d have to deal with that.",

            "reflection": "GAME REFLECTION \n\nRisk management played a huge role in the game, it helped me\nto plan/research then insure n provide some protection as well as coping with\nthe shocks. The research helped me to know the impending risk and how to best to\nhandle them. Insurance reduced the amount of money I had to use to repair the\nshocks once they occur. Protection helped prevent the shocks from occurring. However\nno matter how I distributed the money between doing the necessary research,\nbuying insurance, putting in some sort protection I had to leave a some money\nfor repairing the community once the shocks occur because if not enough money\nis left for repairing, it’s going to take a much longer period of time to\nrepair the community. Therefore balancing all these four was a necessity;\nthough it was not easy as one cannot 100% predict the future however\npreparation made it easier to cope with the shocks.\n\nI played the game a couple of times and each time I played I\ntried to do something different. I changed the insurance policies, the\nprotection I had as well as the research done. The money left for coping\ndiffered as well, its monitoring was low the first games and increased with\ntime as I was left with little money to repair one or two ports which hampered\nmy developments after the shock. I increased my research with time as well as I\nrealized it reduced the impact as well as give me more time to get the bonus\ntime. I learned that it is vital to find the right balance between these four. There\nis no need to do a lot of research and from that research you do not take\naction as suggested. For example if the research shows a high level of occurrence\nand high level of damage it is important to take some insurance and have some\nmoney left to repair. Taking some sort of protection will also go a long way in\nthe future.\n\nShould I be tasked with changing something about the game I would\nmake the calculations more clear and stated. For example if a shock occurs it\nshould indicate how much the damage it has caused and from that damage how much\nwas covered by the insurance, how protection reduced the damage and how\nresearch helped. All these stated in monetary terms because I think it will\nmake it more vivid. I live in a semi desert country so we are most likely to\nhave droughts as compared to floods.\n\n",

            "reflection": "\n\nMY GAME REFLECTION\n\n\nI can say that the main role of risk management for this game of Alora world was\nthe identification, analysis,\nassessment,\ncontrol,\nand avoidance,\nminimization, or elimination of unacceptable risks\n. Through this game I discovered how and why risk management is important for\nthe development of society or country. I learned by research, protection and\ninsurance how  to develop alora community to the best of my ability while\nmeeting milestones to comets threaten. but despite obstacles, I tried to fill\nmy development bqr by building and upgrading pods. and this procedure helped me\nto learn and undestand how to coordinate economical qpplication of resources to\nminimize, monitor and controle the probability and impact of unfornate natural\ndisasters.\nIn terms of knowledge, I reduced the chance of the comet hitting until the impact\nand I received more time of information to create community connections right\nbefore the comet hits: this method helped a lot to boost the protection. And in\nterms of protection; I pressed and hold  the slider, located on the bottom\nright of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.\nThrough this, I prevented the pods from being damaged by matching the level of\nprotection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider.\nfinally; in terms of the power of insurance; I prepared for high severity comet\nby buying a plan. I mean, by obtaining insurance, pods damaged from waves of\ncomets were quicker and cheapper rebuilt. this helped me to recover lost\ndevelopment.\nSo, for the most part, these methods consisted of identifying; characterizing\nthreats of Alora community, assessing the vulnerability of critial assets to\nspecific threats, identifying ways to reduce those risk and prioritizing risk\nreduction measures based on a strategy. \nAnd my choice was to build and upgrade more pods so that I might fill faster\nand increase the amount of wealth. this helped me to continue keeping the meter\ngreen by trying to reach my goal of passing another level.\nConcerning the trade-offs I confronted, I can say that it was not easy to beat\nthe level in the sense of reaching the indicated on this development meter\nbecause of the time and also I did not know how to reach the goal in time. \n\nTherefore, from\nthis game I learned following two elements:\n\n1.      After establishing the context, the\nnext step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risks\nare about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk\nidentification can start with the source of our problems and those of our\ncompetitors (benefit), or with the problem itself. Once risks have been\nidentified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact\nand to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to\nmeasure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for\nsure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring. \n\n2.      \nRisk management regarding natural disasters : It\nis important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods caused\nby comet like in Alora community, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk\nassessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, \nBut if they asket me to develop  a new\nversion of this game, I will increase more money of insurance and to introduce\npeople in building and upgrading pods. I will try to reduce level.\n\nIn summary, I can say that this game helped me a lot to\nunderstand in practice the risk management.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon is a strategy game to teach how and why risk\nmanagement important for a healthy society. Risk Horizon is a nice game that teaches balanced risk preperation and healthy development of the society. In order to achieve success in this game, one has to investigate the researches, consider the limited sources in hand and get insurance for the claims faced.While playing the game; you have to follow the information about the comets that could possibly harm the environment. You have to learn about the chance of hitting, severity and the researches. And then you have to decide to take precautions while developing the community. You have to balance the use of your scarce resources in the game.In the first game I played, I can not decide what to do and how to allocate the resources. But after I got experience after some games I played, I could easily decide what to do and be more successful.To be successful in the game, you have to care about the researches and develop to community to get more wealth (gain more coins) and take the necessary precautions and insurance with your limited resources. (money) People have to spend more time on researches to protect the environment. But as the money you have is limited, you should use this resource in a most balanced way. At one side, you have to develop the community by building new buildings and upgrade these buildings; at the same time you have to take the necessary actions to protect them. These actions are protecting the land and the insurance. By protecting land, you could prevent the harm from the environment and by insurance you could easily repair the harms after a damage.If I produce a new version of this game, I can add some new destroy types like earthquakes fires and etc. to increase the difficulty level. As my country Turkey is the the earthquake zone and there are regular earthquakes in time which had destroyed the buildings and many people died. By the new handicaps, the game players have to decide for more precautions. In this way, game players could learn more about researches and giving decisions for using the scarce resources. In the real environment, people generally do not care about the researches , but they could prevent most of the losses if they care about these researches and get the necessary actions by caring about these information.",

Each time I played I tried to do things\ndifferently on what I had learnt previously. \nI played too many times and did not see any improvement in attaining\nentry to level 4.\n\nInfuriatingly, I have wasted the best part of a Sunday\ngetting worse at a game! I managed to do better earlier in the day. Getting to\nlevel 4 was beyond me or should I say beyond the will to waste any more time.\n\nThe elements of the game, development meter, wealth pool,\nbuilding the pods, insurance, risk, comet severity, chance of impact, research\nand repairs was like juggling (another skill I don’t have) give you a very\nclear perspective on what elements are integral to developing opportunities and\nrisk assessment in a real life situation. \nLuckily for the people living in the pods, they were not relying on me\nto help them develop a safe life and future.\n\nI assumed that insurance had to be taken since in the game,\nit is not a question of if, but when a comet hits. Getting the pods built and\nkeeping them in shape (high enough above the waves) was very difficult. I got a\nbetter score when I did not really know how the research worked. By just doing\nsome research on the comet seemed to work better than actually doing a lot of\nresearch. In the game I spent as much money as possible and could not just\nleave it (build up a reserve) to see how I would get on.\n\nI wish I had only played the game once, but I had to keep\nplaying. Since I did not advance past level 3 I cannot say I improved, though\nmy pods were all getting bigger but I kept just missing reaching the\ndevelopment meter marker, to level 4.\n\nI don’t think I know enough to request a design improvement\nto the game.  It may be a bit callous but\nmaybe if the population of each pod was also incorporated then it would become\nless of a game (or that you would take a bit more care in the choices you take)\nbut keep you focused on what it might be like in a real life situation.\n\nAs I said earlier I do not play games and only because it\nwas part of this course, I would not have done it.  I hope my aversion to games has not taken away\nfrom my learning experience.  I am sure\nthough that many students will really appreciate the game as it is a novel way\nof working the theories into practice without having to take the responsibility\nof having people’s lives at stake.\n\n ",

For this reason, every time I was playing better taking\nbetter decisions to get the best opportunity and benefit taking risks.\n\n \n\nDuring the hole game,\none thing that I have been doing all the time is getting insurance for 75%, as\nI think that if you have the money, is better to invest in a good insurance and\nget the highest income in case of a disaster to prevent a crisis. \n\nAs I said, at the beginning\nI did not know how the protection level worked, so I didn’t get much protection\nand I was losing high percentage of my assets. Slowly I could improve the\nprotection and get more benefits and get less impact from the meteorites.\n\nFurthermore, one more\nmistake I made it was that I was investing creating a lot of pods spread out\nuntil I realized that it was better just to build one, a bit later on another\none… and try to update to the next stage at least one of them before finishing\nthe first level. Also, I started building them together, next to each other to\nreinforce themselves. We can apply this fact into our normal lives, as if we\nwork together in societies, we can support to each other in case of crisis,\nhelp sharing equipment, knowledge on research, etcetera… \n\nSlowly, as I have been\nimproving the steps on the game and learning from the tips, I could get\nmore and more benefit. Unfortunately I couldn’t reach level 3, I have been very\nclose but not possible. My conclusion would be that taking responsible management decisions by taking risks, we have the opportunity to get better benefits or less damage avoiding crisis learning from the past experiences. \n\nRegarding the choice I\nwould made if I could change or add something on the game, I would add the\npersonal facts that can happen, not only externals, like get stolen, or not\nbeing able to work for disease… However, that would get the game much more\ncomplex and I think that made as it has been done is good enough to make us\nlearn what we need to learn and to implement what we learnt ",

            "reflection": "(I'm not a native English speaker ;-))The idea of\nrisk management in the Risk Horizon Game was to lower the damage caused by\ncomets and to support development. I played the game quite often and I always tried to change the expenses\nof risk management but the result was basically always the same – game lost\nafter level 2/3. My first idea was to spend as much money as possible on\nresearch, protection and development and not to focus on one of them. In almost\nevery level I chose to get the best insurance though as it appeared that the\ncosts of damages were always higher than the insurance costs, so insurance was\ncost-effective. I also tried to spend a lot on protection because it lowered\nthe percentage of damage significantly. So, I basically tried to balance the\nexpenses for risk management equally. \n\nI expected\nthat to be the best way to lower the damage but it actually wasn’t. I got the\nbest result when I didn’t spend any money on research but a lot on protection\nand development, esp. development. It is true that the more money I spent on\nrisk management the lower the damage and the costs to repair the pods were. But\nwhen I did it like that, the bar on the left side was always red and I lost the\ngame. Sometimes, the more money I spent, the worse it got, so in that case the game did not always\nconfirm what we learned in the course. But, when you have the financial\nresources and the only expense you have is risk management, then what’s the\npoint of not spending it on more effective risk management but saving it? So\nthat’s one of the things I learned from the game – that even when you have the\nresources and you spend them on risk management, it is not a guarantee that is works. \n\nWhat I also\nlearned is that sometimes you are just lucky or you are not. When you’re doing\nquite well during a level and a bad comet hits you in the last few seconds, the\nbar turns red and you lose. If that same comet has hit me some time before, I\nwould have had enough time to recover, so sometimes it is just all about luck.\nSo, what I would change about the game is the division into levels and the strict\ndeadline. Of course, time is a factor and the faster you can recover when a shock\nhits you, the better. But in real life there is no deadline either, so that\nwhen a shock hits you close to a deadline you are lost and your risk management\nwas worth nothing.. so, to sum it up, it was an interesting but frustrating game to play, which sometimes did and sometimes didn't confirme what we learned before.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1) The role of risk management in the game is to brace the city from negative shocks while increasing developmental points. While furthering the game, i’ve noticed the trade-offs between research and adding/upgrading pods, raising land-level and developmental progress bar and to only be able to research one comet at a time. The game reflects trade-offs as an side effect of limited resources. Funds for scientists may be taken to help with construction, insurance comes in different prices and coverage and that less research also meant less preparation time and coping abilities. Land protection (raising it) could mean all efforts would be put into it instead of further development tasks (hence the development bar turning into red, a halt).\nI made sure to always buy the maximum coverage of insurance (saving up was quick) at the start of every game and juggle my time between upgrading/adding pods and research as both are very vital to counteract the comets. When money is abundant, the pods are doing well and there isn’t any comet in sight, I’d put some time into levelling up the ground for protection. \nBecause this doesn’t just affect the current level I’m on, but the game also brings the level of protection/resources I have to the next level (except the insurance, which were once-offs). This indicates the ability for preparation to have a long term beneficial effect for the planet and to be ready for any potential coming comets/risks.2) I've played the game 2-3 times in a row. The maximum I got was until level 3. After the first round of excessively upgrading the pods and raising land level, I've learnt to put ample time into researching comets. Realizing (via the hints given at the end of each level) that it would give me more time in 'community connection' post negative shocks. This is reflected in the real world that through connecting, communities are able to share disaster coping methods or share resources.3)  The game is good on its own, the story is told, graphics good and most importantly, getting the course takers to understand firsthand what it's like to have to juggle risk taking management and their pros/cons that follows. For where I'm from, I would wish there to be more clarity in the state. At least for the community to understand what risks are being taken or the opportunity costs. It would be best if politicians could be transparent in what fundamental perspectives they're coming from and how the paths they're taking would benefit the problem. At the same time, it is vital for the state to close the gap between the status of the community (insurance, protection, education) and the abundant risk the state is impatiently trying to take upon.",

Financial resources in another important ingredient which is used to protect from risk or insure against it. Risk management helped to remove and reduce the\namount of damage that would be caused by Comet in the area. The area of research played a\nbig role in managing the risk because the information that was gathered through\nresearch greatly contributed to the choices one would make to manage the risk.\nThe information gathered would either be used to allocate resources to protect\nthe community while at the same time investing in development that they need.\nProper management of risk worked for the good of the community because it killed two birds with one stone by protecting the people and development.The information gathered in research also helped to take the step further to plan\nand buy insurance where it was likely that the comet would hit severely to\ncause damage. Building the protection wall is a one off investment whose benefit spread for a number of years. In the period when the impact of the damage was minimal the protective wall was enough measure to manage the risk.The knowledge that was gathered gave the me the opportunity to effectively manage the resources a nation by choosing between protecting the people and protecting the community or both depending on the severity of the case. \n\nI also made sure that I was prudent in my expenditure and\nmaintained focus so that the money was spend not just any how neither  on development only nor on risk management but\nI ensured that the expenditure was strategic. The game helped to make use of information\ngathered through research by interpreting it and then put it to use. \n\nThe preparation for risk really has an effect on development\nin that by building the protection wall enabled the development\nthat took place to be sustained. The cost of implementing risk\nmanagement activities enabled the area to have sustainable development and\nattracted more development. The health community is the important factor for economic development besides government efforts to develop the area by providing the source of employment . \n\nWhen I played the game the first time I never really\nunderstood the game because I did not go through the tutorial.. It was after doing it over again\nand again and spirit of not giving up that I understood it. . The game enabled me to learn that development is achievable where there is\nproper risk management. It is risk management at the end of the day which\nbrings development to any people. I also learnt that risk management and\ndevelopment both require resources and unless the two are well balances there\ncan be no development in an area or the development that had taken some time to\nbuild can crumble just in a twinkling of an eye. Natural disasters cannot be\nthe reason for excuse to protect the community or cause of failure for development\nbut that they are and opportunity for development.\n\n \n\nThe game only focused on one risk as if that was the only\nrisk that usually hit the area. I would add the economic risk as another area of focus. I would add the risk of financial mismanagement and\neconomic risk which are to do with behavior shortfall. This therefore means\nthat that risk management is the foundation for development and must always be\ngiven the attention that it deserves .",

Managing risk is just having in mind that things would come your way (whether good or bad) and putting in place adequate procedures to better handle the shock or forestall the shock all together.The role of risk management in the Risk Horizon Game cannot be under estimated. Having a little knowledge in risk management,i was able to identify the potholes in my first game,find out what brought about them,and put down measures to be resilient to the comet shocks in the subsequent levels. I realized that i had in my power to actually control the probability and impact from the comet shocks by just the way i played the game, building the pods and managing my insurance purchases. Taking into consideration the three components of risk management:knowledge,protection and insurance- the fore knowledge i had of the game from the tutorial session,lessons i got from the game on how to protect myself by building,fortifying and upgrading the pods and managing my insurance. Risk Management helped me further understand the concept of opportunity cost,forgoing one thing for another because the former is much expensive,hence the cheap one will be purchased for the mean time and when the money is now enough,the first is then purchased. I was also faced with the difficulty of allocating my scarce resources \n(money) into constructive planning and insuring my projects.       Taking on risks is necessary to pursue opportunities for development. The risk of inaction may well be the worst option of all (World Development Report 2014,page 4.) had i just left off playing the game after the first level or probably, not even ventured at all,i would not have mastered the intricacy of the game to have even played up to the fourth round. I lost my first round and a few others because,apparently, i didn't pay much attention to the very little information that was conveyed to me during the tutorial session. The subsequent sessions were a success because i learned from my mistakes and put in a few touches like checking for information on the comets and upgrading my structures.       In developing a new version of the Risk Horizon game,i would make it a point to develop it in such a way that the game can be played on any device and at anywhere. For example, the game can only be played on a desktop as it is not supported on tablets. If someone has a deadline to meet,and at the moment,the only device he has by him is a tablet,he wont be able to participate in the game. Also i would develop it in such a way that other flash players can be used to view it and not only the Adobe flash player.     ",

            "reflection": "1. In this game, I think the role of risk management is making proper environment of risk management. I think knowing(research) strength of risk is important, and keeping(saving) resources is very important to have a good protection about riskmanagement, at the sametime make a decision about joining insurance is important too. In this game, Some  risks are chances too low to occur, have to check the strength of the risk, if that risk was strong, I have to take insurance, if not, I can protect if for self-insurance. In contrast, Some risks are can predict must occur, strength are high, I have to prepare internal conditions to confrot those risks. but those strength are not high, I just stand by and watch those risks. In this game I got a scheme about managing risk have to make chain structure between internal and external environments. And knowing risks are  can make down uncertainty of them , Joining insurance is not always the correct answer, In the process of coping risks, I realize the importance of social infra working. If some society have enough reosurces to confront risks can concentrate on after occur risk, if not, we have to prepare about manging risk discover immediately. 2. The first time, I just built 3 towns on the planet. Because if I build many buildings at same, it is too difficult to manage occured risks. I can manage most of all early in the game, but once occured high risk problem, I found there is not enough money to repair out planet. It can says lack of resources, I finally faild to rebuild my planet. The second time, I just left minimum of money, invest all of them to build more towns on the planet. I felt there are not enough money early in the game, but when my planet damaged by risk, I found there are enough resources to repair my planet. Through this failure, I have learned the importance of building a strong foundation for improve risk managemnent.3. In my opinion, If there added more uncertainiy in the game, can have more reality. First of all, in this game, all of risks can be researched by me, and there are no suddeness outbreak some risks. On the second there was just one reigion on the planet, so we can't experience interaction of two or more reigion. If making some systems can exchange resources or trade, it will be more interesting manage risk game.    ",

If I played the game again, I would have developed more pods\nearly on and would have spent less time and resources upgrading the existing\ncommunity.  I think that having a larger\nquantity of basic pods rather than few upgraded pods allows you to have a\nlarger impact.

With that in mind, a change to more dashing strategy seemed to be\nthe best choice. But wasn’t. With more advanced features, without a good\nprotection and insurance, the losses became also bigger. The main lesson was\nthat we may reach a balance between insurance (cheaper and risky) and\nprotection (expensive and reliable), based on knowledge, all as set of means to\nthe main goal: the development of our society. It’s also important to emphasize\nthe power of a community working together, taking care of each other.\n\n  The game makes a very good job by simulating risk management, but\nI think that it should be even better, at least to our reality in Brazil, and\ncausing no loss of plainness, if we could add the possibility to borrow money\nin crisis time. Could be a very simple game add, asking the gamer if he or she\nwants to go to the credit market every time gets out of money. Hence, would be\npossible to advance in some thought levels, without neglecting the awareness of\nthe costs involved to resorting to banks and related.\n\n",

            "reflection": "1.    \nIn this game,\nrisk management is composed of four essential parts, such as spending time and\nsome capital in research (acting as knowledge), raising the level of land\n(acting as protection), buying and renewing insurance policy (acting as\ninsurance), making quick community connections after the hit of comets (acting\nas effective copping). The good preparation and effective copping not only significantly\nreduces the damage caused by the comets, but also boost a stable and sustainable\ndevelopment of the community. \n\nIn\nmy trials of the games, I tended to balance my resources (time and money) among\nknowledge, protection, and insurance. Knowledge is a main consumer of time and\nrelatively small consumer of money; protection not only has large financial\ncosts, but also\ntakes some amount of time to build up; renewing insurance does not take time,\nbut does have financial costs. Eg., making community\nconnection is equivalent to raising maximum 3 bars, so we don’t need to spend marginally expensive\ndollars on raising the land  after we have reached reasonable protection, on the other, it tells  the upper limit of copping, so I can not\nfully rely on researching and making quick community connections, but have to\nkeep the protection always at proper level, being aware that I can raise another\n3 bars, and if anything happens\nbeyond my expectations, insurance can play out as the last resort. I like to buy the 33% insurance, because, in terms of\nthe ratio of the coverage and cost, 33% package yields the best. \n\n Preparation\nfor risk may seem to impede development immediately,  since they cost money, which otherwise can be\nused to invest into Pod upgrades, and it costs time. But in the long run, it\nactually help to accelerate the development, which would otherwise be pushed\nbackward significantly with the hit of comets, especially at more advanced\nstages, when the comets are more frequent and the damage is more severe. \n\n 2.    \nIn my first play,\nI didn’t spend time in research, which became my bottleneck as I did\nnot have enough money to constantly keep my protection bar at high\nlevel to shield from external shocks. Besides, I lefts a few\nlands deserted rather than developed, this seems problematic later\non, as too few pods would not generate enough money to develop further and manage risk. \n\n The main\nthings I learned were \n\n1)   \nAcquiring both\ngeneral knowledge and specific knowledge about a particular comet help us to make better decision on resource\nallocations and more effective copping after the negative outcome happens. \n\n2)   \nProtection and\ninsurance well balance each other, act as another two pillars in risk\nmanagement. \n\n3)   \nEffective copping\n(making quick community connections) not only requires a fast action after the\ndisaster happens, but also well preparedness (such as research)\n\n\n\n3.    \nI would make two\nchanges if I were allowed to.  \n\n I would make\nresearch more costly. The currently research seems to be a main consumer of\ntime, but not money. I would think in real life, research (not only limited in\nscience and technology) requires significant amount of financial inputs, and in\nmost cases, the more negative impacts the comets potentially have, the more\nresearch resources it needs. \n\n I would make\nthe timing of the comets less predictable. In real life, the timing of risk is\nunknown in many cases, such as terrorist attacks, tsunami, and earthquake. The\ncurrent setup has all the comets attack time being known, and make us easier to\nget prepared  (than what happens in real\nlife.)\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "\n\nMY GAME REFLECTION\n\n\nI can say that the main role of risk management for this game of Alora world was\nthe identification, analysis,\nassessment,\ncontrol,\nand avoidance,\nminimization, or elimination of unacceptable risks\n. Through this game I discovered how and why risk management is important for\nthe development of society or country. I learned by research, protection and\ninsurance how  to develop alora community to the best of my ability while\nmeeting milestones to comets threaten. but despite obstacles, I tried to fill\nmy development bqr by building and upgrading pods. and this procedure helped me\nto learn and undestand how to coordinate economical qpplication of resources to\nminimize, monitor and controle the probability and impact of unfornate natural\ndisasters.\nIn terms of knowledge, I reduced the chance of the comet hitting until the impact\nand I received more time of information to create community connections right\nbefore the comet hits: this method helped a lot to boost the protection. And in\nterms of protection; I pressed and hold  the slider, located on the bottom\nright of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.\nThrough this, I prevented the pods from being damaged by matching the level of\nprotection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider.\nfinally; in terms of the power of insurance; I prepared for high severity comet\nby buying a plan. I mean, by obtaining insurance, pods damaged from waves of\ncomets were quicker and cheapper rebuilt. this helped me to recover lost\ndevelopment.\nSo, for the most part, these methods consisted of identifying; characterizing\nthreats of Alora community, assessing the vulnerability of critial assets to\nspecific threats, identifying ways to reduce those risk and prioritizing risk\nreduction measures based on a strategy. \nAnd my choice was to build and upgrade more pods so that I might fill faster\nand increase the amount of wealth. this helped me to continue keeping the meter\ngreen by trying to reach my goal of passing another level.\nConcerning the trade-offs I confronted, I can say that it was not easy to beat\nthe level in the sense of reaching the indicated on this development meter\nbecause of the time and also I did not know how to reach the goal in time. \n\nTherefore, from\nthis game I learned following two elements:\n\n1.      After establishing the context, the\nnext step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risks\nare about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, risk\nidentification can start with the source of our problems and those of our\ncompetitors (benefit), or with the problem itself. Once risks have been\nidentified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact\nand to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple to\nmeasure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know for\nsure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring. \n\n2.      \nRisk management regarding natural disasters : It\nis important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods caused\nby comet like in Alora community, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk\nassessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, \nBut if they asket me to develop  a new\nversion of this game, I will increase more money of insurance and to introduce\npeople in building and upgrading pods. I will try to reduce level.\n\nIn summary, I can say that this game helped me a lot to\nunderstand in practice the risk management.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The role in\nthe game was to make a contingency planning to prevent and protect the planet\nfrom the comets attack. There was different types of comets, so I had to face\neach problem in a different way but looking for the same outcome, protect the\nplanet. Sometimes I could protect it, and sometimes because of the lack of\nenough time, I had to prioritize and cope with the damage. There were three\ndifferent ways to manage the risk, the best of them between researching,\ninsuring or putting the planet higher, was with knowledge. I mean, the more I\nstudied the threat the more time I had to make the damage lower. So it was\nbetter to start to study the comet as soon as I saw it coming up to me.\n\n \n\nAlthough I\nhave only introduced one code, I played more than six times, and every time I\nhave played, I have changed my strategy to find what was the best option to\nminimize the damage and to pass to the next level. Once I found the way to do\nit better, I tried to improve on it. So, the most important thing that I have\nlearnt about risk management is you have to try to see the problem (comet) as\nsoon as possible, and study it. When preparation is weak the damage is worse.\nThe more you know what kind of problem is coming, the more you can measure what\nkind of solutions fix better because, as in real life, there was a limit, the\nmoney. And a good  preparation for risk\nwill reduce losses.\n\n \n\nAs I could\nsee in the game, a nation not only have to be prepared to cope with his own\nproblems, distribute the resources to build more or less pods for growing up\nwhile the planet was being attacked. Problems were coming from outside time and\ntime again, so I had to learn how to deal with, or I would not pass the level.\nIn the place where I live (Ourense, Spain), every summer we have to suffer lots\nof fires because of the extreme heat and the lack of responsibility of some\npeople who do not care where to put their rubbish or papers during a day in the\ncountryside  . We know it is going to\nhappen, fields that burn in a couple of hours have a resilience of years. So\nthat, we know when (in summer),  more or\nless we know the severity, we have got an acceptable number of firemen, but\nwhat we do not have is environment education, respect to the future generation,\nand conscience with the problem. So I would put education in capital letters.\nEducation is development.   ",

The role of risk management in\nthe game reflected by the preparation need such as:\n\n-         \nInspect the comet severity and chance of hit. \n\n-         \nBuy the appropriate insurance to recover from after\nshock\n\n-         \nWhen the danger nearby need to have protection intact\nduring the process of impact.\n\nThe choices I make, I do all yet I\ncan’t see any feedback related to the action I’ve acted upon. It’s sometimes\nhappen, sometimes doesn’t.  So I don’t understand.\n\n\nThe way of Preparation, I don’t see\nany changes whether I click the ‘protection’ button in the beginning (when\ncomet still a far) VS the impact (when comet sinking below the sea or hit the\npond).\n\n \n\n2. I play many times and my feedbacks\nare as below. It is a poor-design game and less inspiring in relation the key\nmessage that needed to be taken care of. The main thing that I learn the game:\nnice attempt to make understanding but its better read from previous projects\nand examples given during the course. \n\n \n\n3. If I can add, it’ll be better\nto measure clearly the difficulties of each level and once I step up, I don’t have\nto repeat to level 1 again. Also I’ll add sensitive respond that when\napproaching critical action that needed to be made, will show some ‘call-out’\nto make player understand what must be done. It’s better to make the longer level\n(1-10 level) despite the 1-2 that unreachable.  My team surely can make better game from this\none. I had experience by making a commercial game for my brand before.\n\nPost Game Experience Comments:\n\nThe role of risk management part is\nreflected by the ‘protection’ button and the ‘research’ in the comet. When the\ncomet come even we had prepare with the insurance, the protection also can’t\nhelp much. Probably the message is clear yet the game have many bugs that make\nthis game are less-educated but annoying. \n\nThe insurance button also can’t\nfunction well, didn’t describe which type of insurance is available (if it’s\nonly allowed one time basis). Again perhaps the bugs doesn’t support with slow\ninternet connection.\n\nThe preparation seem useless\nbecause there’s no button to measure whether we had enough, less, or not\nsufficient protection that given by the fee of $1. I don’t see any changes in\nthe landscape or around it. The game is poorly sets up.\n\nThe research so called power, yet\nthere’s no feedback whether the research are sufficient to make the ‘severity’\ndecrease or maybe the ‘chance of hit’. It’s just cost $5 with bars colored, not\nto mention the less responsive bars when we hit it.\n\n As I keep on trying the game, it\ndidn’t show remark that the failure after level 2 and repeat for only relevant level\nbut also no clue that we had to begin again. The setting of this game seem just\nautomatically bring player to downgrade to level 1 and it’s such a less\nmotivating game with knowledge that are superficial! My previous vendor in\ncompany can do better than this. The way I learn it is very much different from\nmy expectation from the theory or the story tutorial from the game itself. Its\npoor made game!\n\nTo change the game is doing the\nopposite as what my input above and also to make it more user-friendly. The\ngamer don’t like to play a game that too hard to achieve especially when it comes\nfrom the bug-error! To be educated, game should bring more joyful experience of\nlearning, not intimidating or giving gradual level of difficulties, to make the\nunderstanding of key message convey intelligently. I can’t relate the game with\nthe theory given from the entire professor in World Bank said in their video\nlecture.\n\nEducation should be fun in order\nto give understanding and inspire the next action. It shouldn’t bring\nincapability as the main focus. \n\n ",

            "reflection": "The\nrole of risk management in the game was to help me in making decisions\nregarding the protection of my pods from the meteors. I had to make choices as\nto how I would evenly distribute my time when it came to gaining more knowledge\nabout the meteors, protecting my pods more, and buying more insurance to\neventually lower the costs if ever there are damages done. The preparation of\nrisk did not immediately take effect since by buying more pods, buying\ninsurance, and protecting my pods, I was spending my money, but when the\nmeteors came and hit my pods, all of the risks I took paid off. By building and\nupgrading more pods, I was able to have a wider connection that helped decrease\nthe damage done by the meteors, and by buying insurance, costs were lowered if ever\na meteor did hit some of my pods. \n\n \n\nI\nplayed the game twice since the first time around, I lost the game at level 1.\nMy mistake in my first attempt was that I was so focused on protecting my pods\nthat I wasted all my money on protection instead of insurance, and building\nmore pods. So when the time came that a meteor was about to hit, I barely had\nany connections and the damage was too severe that what was left of my money\nwasn’t able to cover the costs. I also wasted my time protecting the pods that\nI forgot all about gaining more knowledge about the incoming meteors. \n\n \n\nWhat\nI learned from the game is that knowledge, protection and insurance are all\nequally important when it comes to risk management. By gaining more knowledge\nabout an incoming risk, you get to know how to better face the risk when the\ntime comes, and you become more ready for the risk as well. By allotting just\nthe right amount of protection – not too much nor too little – you reduce the\ndamage that can be done by the risk. And by buying insurance, you reduce costs\nof damage done by the risk. \n\n \n\nIf I\nwere to change the game, I would add a source to where all the money is coming\nfrom. May it be a certain pod that handles the businesses or markets, or\nsomething else. It may be a bit of a challenge, but it will make the game more\nrealistic since money doesn’t really flow that freely into the market. ",

            "reflection": "In the\ngame, the role of risk management was to fight against natural disasters,\nrepresented by comets, by managing research, protection and insurance in a\nlimited time.\n\nI choose to\ngive priority to research and protection, continuing the development of the\ncommunity in order to improve its wealth constantly and as quickly as possible.\nIndeed, when protection is strong enough, there are no damages, so insurances\nare useless, and we know how strong the protection has to be thanks to the observation\nof comets and by accumulating knowledge about the dangers.\n\nThis\nstrategy was sufficient to win the level 3 of the game, but I think, in a\nlonger run, I should have bought insurances, because it's possible that after a\ncertain time, a more dangerous comet or several comets fallen at the same\nmoment would have destroyed protections.\n\nRisks are\nsmaller when people get more knowledge about their real level and possible\nimpact. This enable the community to prepare itself for natural disasters by\nbuilding protections and coping. These protections save the wealth of the\ncommunity and it can continue its development on this basis. When the community\nloses an important part of its wealth in a dramatic shock, then there is a\nrupture in development, and it can't continue as well on the same basis.",

            "reflection": "Question\nOne:\n\nRisk is real and should be managed; therefore there\nshould be a process in place to ensure that this is done. This is the greatest\nlesson that I got from the game.\n\nI had to know the kind of risk that I faced, the\nlikelihood of its occurrence and the severity: i had to strike a balance\nbetween the resources and the protection measures I took. For shocks with the\nmost severity and high possibility of occurrence, I researched more and invested\nquite a lot of resources to buy insurance. On the other hand, i ignored shocks\nthat have a high risk of occurrence but no severity on my community, as much as\nI had spent time and resources to gain knowledge of their existence.\n\nI made sure that I wasn’t caught up in the risk management\nprocess and forget about development of my community, with the knowledge of\nrisks and insurance in place, I channeled my resources to development of new\nstructures and upgrade of existing ones. Preparation for risk on time meant\nmore resources for development in the long run.\n\nQuestion\nTwo:\n\nHaving played the game twice, the second time I learnt\nthat I don’t have to invest so much resource on all risks. I learnt that I should\nhave knowledge of all risks but I should classify them based on the probability\nof occurrence versus the impact. The impact is the most important as there some\nrisks that have a high probability of occurring but have no impact and thus\ninvesting on them isn’t a priority, the converse is true.\n\nQuestion\nThree:\n\nIf I were to redesign the game I would incorporate a risk\nelement that brings about opportunities if well managed .Example, too much rain\n(flooding) in an area. If well managed, the water can be channeled  to dry areas of the community for irrigation\npurposes or be used to plant crops that do well in water logged areas e.g. rice.\nThe game has negative elements of risk and totally ignores the positive side of\nrisk.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a pivotal role in this game in\nprioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them. Its role can be outlined as\nbelow:\n\n·        \nTo ensure long-term survival of the community of\nAlora\n\n·        \nTo provide immediate protection and relief from\nshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insurance\n\n·        \nTo ensure timely and justified protection at the\ntime of crisis\n\n \n\nImportant choices had to be made for each crisis according\nto its severity. Due to limited resources, it was\nimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimum\nutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching the\nisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basis\nof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance of\na hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I would\nimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gather\nknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal in\nsafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, being\ncomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making a\ntrade-off between risk and resources, I was\nable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.\n\nWhile making preparations for the shock, again a\ntrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due to\nlimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted so\nthat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would not\nupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buy\ninsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on development\ndue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain more\nresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resources\nwas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoided\nby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of development\nslowed down the process of growth of resources.\n\n \n\nHaving played the game more than once, I learnt certain\nvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.\nInitially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize the\nrisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized that\ndevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick pace\nto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary to\nprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, I\nbegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordingly\nspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community against\nthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive the\nbarrage of incoming comets. \n\nThis game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-world\ncrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of time\nmanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct and\njustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.\n\n \n\nHailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize that\ncorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequate\nsocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in risk\nmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a just\nand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice to\nall citizens of the community.\n\n ",

            "reflection": " \n\nThe role of risk management in the game was to support and guaranty\nthe development of the community of the world of Alora that faces continuously\nthe risk of falling comets that can hinder the development. Risk management\nplays an essential role in the game because without it wouldn’t be possible to\nhave development in the community. It is extremely necessary a good management\nof research, protection and insurance. The balance of these three aspects of\nrisk management prepares and protects the community from future shocks, coping\nand learns with them while in the same time the community continues to grow. \n\nIn the game a lot of situations appear to confront the\nstrategy of making choices to develop the community while managing risks. The\nresources are the central choice of the game, first of all because nothing can be\ndone without it and them because it is crucial to manage in what will be spent\nand when. It also has to be considered chose between long term protection and\nknowledge when comets approaches the atmosphere or considered both against insurance\nthat is part of the process of coping with the consequences. Sometimes in the\ngame I had to trade-off long term protection to knowledge to have more time to\nmake connections and lessen damages. In the case of insurance I always preferred\nto have it. Also, immediately, preparation for risk affects development, especially\nif is bad manage, because if the resources are not balance the community doesn’t\nhave enough to prosper. But after some time and if is well manage, preparation\nfor risk contributes to protect the community from shocks and their possible consequences.\n \n\nIf I played the game only once in the next time I would\nmanage better the resources by not spending all with the most expensive insurance\nand building plots until nothing left; have more knowledge through spending\nmore time in research and in consequence have more time to make connections in\nthe community; manage when to spend time and resources with long term\nprotection; and give more attention to the update of the plots that leads the\ncommunity’s development. \n\nAlternatively, if I played the game more than once, after\nthe first time I would spend less with long term protection and more time with\nresearch.\n\nFurthermore, one of the main things that I learned from the\ngame is that is essential to spent resources preparing for risks. When a comet\nreach the ocean and damage the community the benefits of research, insurance\nand long term protection appear and make all the difference by preventing from\nthe consequences and also coping with them if that’s the case. Other learning\nis the importance of balance the resources along the game and to be strategic to\ndevelop the community while managing risks. \n\nImaging that I am\nresponsible for developing a new version of the game I would propose some risk management\nchoices to represent a matter of public health in the place where I live. In my\ncommunity there is a kind of insect called Dengue that contaminates the\npopulation in various levels and can lead to death. There is no vaccine for\nthis disease and also no medicine specific for it. What I would made in this\ncase is reduce the insurances and add and invest in more long term protection\nsince is possible to completely avoid the development of this specie.  ",

            "reflection": "The game is interesting. At first I failed to understand how to improve my skill. After few attempts, I started to learn the plan. The game is about creating something and then protect it with your available funds. The successful protection will help one to lessen the damage when any disaster will really arrive. At first I attempted to use two plots with the money and then protect the surrounding when the cash flow is above the requirement. The management of using the money will help to alleviate the losses in future. Now I am attempting to answer the questions.1.The role of the risk management is the successful protection of the created product.The trade-offs is the price of the product and its protection cost. If more products are made, more money would be required to protect them. So, the trade-off is to manage the product development and fiscal usage.It seems to happen immediately sometimes; otherwise they usually occur after some time.2. If I only play once, I will sure not build so many setups altogether. Because if more setups, we need more protection. But there's not enough money. So, any disaster will make one total bankrupt. I will surely try to build less setup for keeping the risk lesser.3. The game is awesome and it helps to get some idea about planning and risk management. I will make the game avatars more friendly and realistic. FAQ or how to play occasionally doesn't work. Better if we can integrate some learning environment of the game while we are making mistakes. Like the popup tips to play better. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management played an very fundamental role in this game. On the one hand it was important to gather the information about the comets and on the other hand to level up the plots to protect them from damage once they are hit by a comet. Furthermore it was also important to take the appropriate amount of insurance. There was a trade-off between research and protection. I always tried to reach the necessary amount of protection to avoid damage. If you did a lot for risk preparatio , the development lacked behind after some time. But if you spend a lot time and money on risk preparation, the damage is less in comparison to no risk preparation. I played the game twice and tried to find out more about the comets and spend more time on research. The main things I learned from the game are that you have to take many different things into account when you want to do an robust risk management. You have to be flexible and it is not a good decision to stick to old plans when the circumstances are changing. With a changing environment and changing conditions you may have to adjust your plans and underlying assumptions. It is always important to look into the future to prevent or to lower shocks. Nonetheless one should not forget about the past event, because it is a good opportunity to learn something to prevent future events. I live in Germany. One could say that i live in a relatively safe country with not a lot if risks. With respect to the European Union we are dependent from other countries. Therefore I would suggest to have another planet which represents our partner countries. Our damage should be in some way independent from our damage. Furthermore we should have the opportunity to help them or not. This should in turn influence our damage or even more our chance to recover from the event. ",

Because\nlimited recourses/ pressure of time \n- not enough time to reach the protection level which could reduce the\nseverity.\n\nMy decision\nto was to invest resources in insurance of maximum coverage and spend time on research\nto create community connections. Result of this action – destruction level not\nvery high and because of insurance low cost to recover  fully effective of village. Because of the\nhighest option of insurance I could spent the small amount of cash (limited recourses\nat the beginning of the game) and rebuilt all building almost in the same time.\nI thing that if I made a different choice – fully protection as main goal – not\nenough time to reach enough level I would failed in this scenario.\n\nI played 2\ntimes, the first time reach 6 level and the second time only 5. What happened that\nthis second time I got the worst result? The high risky shock ( fully severity\nand chance of hit) at the end of time to reach a goal. I had got enough recourses\nso I took fully insurance and focused on increasing protection to maximum level\n– not reached before the comet strike –one level of protection not reached. I didn’t\nspare enough time to research. The result: the shock strike and make average\ndamage ( because high protection), witch high insurance I could restore destroyed\nbuildings with low cost. This action reduce the effective of village and because\nof this it was not enough time to rebuild the damage and have enough effectives\nto reach goal before times out. \n\nThe better\nsolution would be focused also research not only on protection.\n\nIt’s obvious\nthat we can not predict all consequence of shocks, we can decrease the risk of\nthis treats. Well prepare plan should contain the long perspective of time – we\nshould consider the consequents of each shock and be prepped that it cause some\ndamage even if we are sure that the plan is in 100% well prepped and contains\nall tool to decrease the risks. Another conclusion after this exercise is knowledge\nthat we shouldn’t focused only on one type of component ( knowledge,\nprotection, insurance) even if we can increase one of them on maximum level it’s\nnot good solution - we should find the golden mine of this all areas.\n\nThe game is\nvery well designed, the scenario is neutral and nice, the tools for manage risk\nare simple and well described. I would not change anything in mechanism of\ngame.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The first time I played the game, I could not go pass level 1 and then I realised that I was not taking risks and I was trying to be too careful. In order for the bar to increase in good time, I had to get the insurance in order to pay less for damage and I had to confront the comets instead of wasting so much time and money on protection. Reading about the comets also helped a great deal because of knowledge increase on a better way to face them.In all I played the game twice. The game made me understand the opportunities involved in risk management.  From it, I was able to understand the importance of taking on risks for example; building of more pods to increase the bar when normally people would not want to do so because they only want to protect the 1 they have which in turn ends up giving them little or no income available for survival.I got to understand the importance of insurance policies. For example, in level 3 I was hit by a comet which caused 53% of damage. Just imagine if I had not gotten an insurance policy that covered 50% of the damage, I would have paid through my nose and definitely not have been able to increase the bar enough to pass the level. It made me understand that the society and government at large are there to help us face these risks.Unfortunately, I did not get pass level 4 due to the many comets attacking the city at once but if I were to have upgraded my city, paid for the 75% insurance policy and used the protection, I'm sure I would have gone 2 levels up.If I had a chance to develop a new version of the game,  I will put up mote knowledge about the different comets that is when they were most liable to strike in different times of the year and how dangerous they are to the environment. In Nigeria for instance, we are faced with heavy floods and the new one \"Book Haram\" in the Northern sides. A good way to tackle them will be having good knowledge on the type of places they like to attack and putting up top security in these areas (my opinion though). Life is all about risks and our ability to confront and turn them into gains makes us able to live through life.Thank you. Pamela Bassey-Duke",

            "reflection": "In order to succeed at this game, a balanced approach was needed between building a strong set of pods, raising their level, gaining information to know how to react and using insurance to mitigate losses.  I tended largely towards protection, trying to build a strong infrastructure.  I used information to try to assess the risk, buying insurance when the risk seemed beyond my ability to fund for it.  The stronger I was able to build my buildings, and using my connections after being damaged, the better I performed.  It was also helpful to rebuild as quickly as possible after being hit.The first time I didn't use connections as well as I could have.  The second time I played the game, I was more aware of this feature and was able to play for a longer period of time.  Sharing resources with others, and receiving help in return was beneficial.  I learned that it can sometimes be too late to transfer risk using insurance, but that using connections after the fact can help to make up for the lack of insurance protection.  Basically, an overall balanced approach worked best.I was a little confused about the source of incoming funds.  I couldn't tell where they came from or if my method of play impacted funding.  I think it is important in real life to have a good understanding of what resources are available, what impacts the funding stream and the most effective ways of improving income.  If I were to make changes to this game, that is the area where I would be most likely to make changes.I may also try to provide a more realistic analogy to the connections portion of the game.  Moving the cursor from bright start to the next one to light up didn't give me a good feel for what the real life counterpart of this part of the game could be.  Building strong buildings and seeking insurance coverage made sense to me, as did gaining realistic information about the likelihood and severity of a loss.  The connections part was not as transparent to me.  I would try to provide supplemental guidance on this phase of the game so that it becomes as relevant as the other aspects.Overall, the game was a good learning experience.  It stressed preparation, showed that preparation has a cost, but that lack of preparation can be even more costly.  It also showed that strengths have to be in place before disaster strikes, there is definitely a penalty for procrastination.",

            "reflection": "\n\nThe role of risk management in the game is to prepare for\npossible terrestrial strikes which could cause drastic damage to the\nsettlement. At the beginning, I bought a 50% insurance coverage and gradually\nlift the ground to the pink level. Sometimes, I observed the comets to find out\nits damage severity and chance of hitting; however, I did not do so frequently\nsince I had to spend cash quickly for development and risk management. My\nstrategy is to spend a majority of cash on lifting the ground since there will\nbe no damage if the ground is lifted to the pink level. Another reason is that\nthe higher the level, the higher the cost of insurance and repairing. When the\ncomets hit the settlement, I would have to spend extra cash and time to recover\nthe settlement which greatly impeded the development. By lifting the ground in\nadvance for possible terrestrial strikes, I save a lot by lowering the\ninsurance cost and eliminating repairing cost. \n\nHowever, focusing on lifting the ground limits the resources\nto spend on insurance and the time to observe the comet. As the game processed,\nI had to lower the insurance coverage to 33% to save cash. If a comet with huge\ndamage had hit my settlement, I would have spent tons of cash to recover. Since\nI had to constantly hold the button to lift the ground, I had limited to\nobserve the comets. This exposed my settlement to greater severity and chance\nof hitting. The preparation for risk management does affect the development. On\nthe negative side, the risk management costs a lot of cash and time. Observing\nthe comets reduces the time to focus on development and other risk management\noptions. Since cash builds up very fast, not spending appropriate time to spend\nit on either upgrading or lifting the ground can make you lose the game.  Although insurance proves to be useful if the\ncomets hit, it is expensive in the early game. With little cash left after\npurchasing insurance, contacts with comets can leave you no money. Lifting the\nground extensively gradually drains the money which slows the development rate.\nOn the positive side, the preparation for risk does reduce the damage and help develop\nthe settlement\n\nI would slightly adjust my strategy if I could play again.\nSwitching to 33% insurance as soon as I lift the ground close to the pink level\nis possibly a better choice. The main thing I learn is that extensive\npreparation for risk seems to be a very good strategy to confront risk. It\ndramatically lowers the damage and thus reducing the need for insurance and\nrepairing. \n\nI would propose the idea of reducing the benefit of decreasing\ndamage by lifting the ground. In game, when players lift their ground to the\npink level, they incur no damage when the comets hit the settlement. In fact, there\nis no perfect prevention in real life. Every risk can cause a certain degree of\ndamage. Prevention must combine with knowledge and insurance to produce the\nbest possible result. In Fort Worth, my current city, I suggest the state\ngovernment to improve the health insurance rate since it helps more citizen\nbetter deal with diseases. The healthier the population, the lower the medical\ncosts and the better the productivity are. \n\n",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management is to secure structures built so to have minimum damage when the comet hits. The trick is on cost for resilience versus the damage and the cost of repairing the structure. Insurance comes in as a factor which will take care of damage costs upon the risk occurring. In playing the game, I built the structures, and keep upgrading to keep up it even stronger. For insurance I decided to go for the average premium charge mainly because of the time factor and the funds available. With the time taken to prepare for the risk, development slowed down, the focus was shifted from developing new structures to protecting the two structures I had already built.Playing the game again, I would have to focus also on the comet, understand the potential effects and then be able to judge if my structures would be able to survive with minimum defects. Though the comets have chances of missing, so the resilience costs would be on judged on the available funds and the damage potential of the risk. What I picked as a lesson from the game, is that as much as development is much desired, more attention should be given to protecting already existing structures, there is a time factor attached to it, procrastinating will result to more funds being needed in repairing the structures after the comets have hit.In developing the game, first it would be a clearer description of the research, the time allocated must be clear from the information shown on the comet. The occurrence of the risk is much quicker and gives less time for critical thinking on coming up with the appropriate decision to make, so I would slow it down, give the player enough time to make well thought of decisions, putting the availability of funds in to consideration.        ",

            "reflection": "Question 1:The risk management had a huge role in the game especially considering how the resources (time and money) had to be used effectively while confronting the comet with different levels of Severity, Chance of Hit and Speed. The choices and trade offs were on Research, Protection and Insurance. If the risk of severity was not mitigated taking into considerations the speed of the various comets then the damage would be larger than that could be rebuilt. Also, considering if the Chance of Hit is high than it would be too much of risk not to perform enough Research which could help even after a strike for lesser damage. Also, insurance purchase was a trade off for the resources (money) which could be used for development but then certain level of insurance helps in the long run to mitigate the risk if and when a comet strikes/hits with higher severity and when less research has been done and while the chance of hit are high. This could typically happen if time is not utilized effectively to manage the resources.Preparing for risk did effect development especially in the beginning since more time had to be allotted to mitigate the risk in increasing the protection level. Though resource of time is available most of it would be utilized for risk mitigation and development. But once a certain level of protection was built utilizing the time, there would be possibility of sparing time for development (provided money is available) by closely monitoring the \"severity\" of the incoming comets are not higher than the already set protection.Question 2:If I had played the game only once, I would take care of the speed of the comets and accordingly check the \"Severity\" and \"Chance of hit\" and utilize my resources more effectively. The only thing that I did differently was to utilize the time more effectively in Research and Protection. One of the major things I learned from the game was that a lot of time is spent in preparing for risk mitigation and that not much is left for development especially in the beginning. This corroborates well with the developing countries pace of development. Also, a lot of money needs to be spent in risk management which becomes a point to ponder on weather to invest or not especially in the  beginning. Question 3:Towards improving the risk management choices, I imagine that the community could have sectors of different socitial requirements (school, hospitals, public utility centers [water, electricity etc supply] library, community center, entertainment centers, religious centers, residential area, commercial areas etc)  and development of the community could be on need basis for the present time with some preset conditions. The \"Chance of Hit\" could have additional probability of hitting a certain sector. Accordingly, the choices of Protection and Research as a risk mitigation tools could be used by the player depending on what would be important at that point in time (and the scores of the green bar accordingly increased/decreased). ",

            "reflection": "The game summed up well the concept of risk and how it can\nbe managed. Given the constant risk (the shock of comets striking) and\nthe limited resources available (1. money to build pods/protection; 2. time\navailable to build them, say, before the next shock arrives), what I learnt was\nthat there indeed is no one best solution, but there are multiple optimal\nsolutions. For example, an increased focus on protection (raising the city) left\nless money for insurance and development; and vice versa. Work a little too\nmuch on research, and you lose time to protect from and limit the damage. It is\nabout finding the right balance, which took a little while to understand. It\nwas amply clear by the end the exercise that all the four pillars of risk\nmanagement—knowledge, protection, insurance, coping—are equally important, and that\nfocusing on one to the exclusion of others would be incorrect.Preparation for risk, which in this case was to spend sufficient/optimal\ntime on researching the comet definitely helped in understanding the risk\nlevels. And that meant the following: 1. Sufficient/optimal protection could be\nensured provided enough resources were available; 2. Getting insurance so that,\nknowing the impact levels, appropriate measures can be taken to enable less\npainful rebuilding; and 3. More time for making connections, that is, community\nrebuilding, is available to help in the process of coping with the impact of\nthe shock.I learnt the nuances of the game, and thereby risk\nmanagement, by playing the game multiple times. The first time I played, I concentrated\na little more on building pods (development) and insuring them and researching\nthe comets (knowledge/preparation), and paid a little less attention to\nprotecting the city. Though I managed to get through to the second round, I\ncould not proceed beyond. After playing the game a few times, each time, in\nhindsight, concentrating a little less on protection in comparison to other\nfactors, because it tended to take away time from risk research\n(knowledge/preparation for risk), I found that though I was insured well and\nhad enough time to form connections (coping after shock), I had left the city\nvulnerable, and that, with progressing levels, providing greater protection\nmeant more time away from preparation and greater costs. As a direct\nconsequence of this learning, I ensured that I raised the protection levels during\nthe initial stages, so as to ensure that I could build a certain amount of\nresistance to protect from small shocks. That meant there was more time to\nprepare for worse shocks and ensure insurance and development in the initial,\nand vital, stage of growth. So, if I were to play the game again, and only once,\nI would certainly start off by paying a little more attention to ensuring a\nlittle more than basic protection to protect from small shocks, though I do admit,\nin real-life situations, this might not be always applicable. Each problem is unique,\nand would require a custom solution, though built on the same four-factor\nframework of risk management.If I could tweak one thing about this game to ensure it is\neven closer to real-life situations would be to introduce an uncertain risk.\nFor example, I would prefer there be a sudden earthquake that could destroy the\npods to a certain degree and provide an option of a costlier insurance that\nincludes protection from such earthquakes. Participants then can save money/resources\naccordingly. However, to offset this a bit, I would also ensure, say, greater\nplay time or more initial corpus to start with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

            "reflection": "The game illustrates very graphically how preparation for risk pays off in the long run, even if it may seem costly when things are moving smoothly and shocks are not materializing. Indeed the game exemplifies all four elements of risk management, including the three proactive ones of acquiring knowledge - by scanning the sky for comets and studying them -, building protection - by elevating the surface - and buying insurance - to partly offset eventual property damages -, as well as the reactive one of coping - by moving quickly after disaster has struck -.A few conclusions can be derived from the game, which serve as reflections for real life:- A good combination of knowledge and protection building can effectively avoid the manifestation of damages altogether in a wide range of circumstances, by either ensuring that the threat is known in advance so that specific protocols can be adopted before the shock or by putting protections in place that will avoid or minimize the damage resulting thereof.- In case of unusually large shocks, it may not be financially viable to build matching levels of protection or the early warning system may not give enough time to implement the combination of high knowledge and high protection that would completely eliminate the manifestation of losses. In such cases, some degree of insurance may be necessary to mitigate the impact in development of the shock.- Allocation of resources has to be optimized across various risk management elements and with development... developing too fast or investing too much time and money in one particular risk management element may come at the expense of having sufficient funds or time to develop the proper risk management mix.- Running particularly low levels of financial reserves introduces the further risk of not having the flexibility to react to new information and emerging requirements.While I think the game is great in its current format, a possible upgrade could include making a set of specific programs available at each level that the user can selected and invest a certain amount of money on while expecting a return, such as investing X $ in upgrading the knowledge acquisition tools so that knowledge can be gained faster, or implementing special retrofitting program to make pods less prone to damage, etc. Another addition might be the ability to purchase a report providing an estimate of the likelihood of receiving strikes of comets of different intensities in a given year.",

            "reflection": "What was the role of risk management in the game?Risk management was used to mitigate the losses caused by asteroids and to enable the resilient development of a prosperous civilization. Preparation (getting to know how to play the game) and coping (play the game by making clever decisions) were key factors for mastering the game.What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?The main trade-offs in this game were related to protection (by raising the ground) and economic growth (by upgrading the facilities). Since the main target was to accumulate a certain level of wealth during a given time, one has to constantly decide on either spending the money on protection or development. It was also possible to get an insurance but this required only one payment upfront. Consequently, it was important to save some money (by foregoing upgrading the facilities) at the end of each level in order to be able to afford an insurance.In what ways did preparation for risk affect developmemt (immediately, or after some time)?The preparation for risk had a significant impact on the damages on the facilites of the developing civilization. The negative effects of these damages could be mitigated by conducting some research, raising the ground and getting an insurance in the ex ante risk management phase.What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Since I live in a country that is known for its alpine regions, a game could be developed that is about risk management concerning avalanches.",

            "reflection": "Risk horizon is definitely a game everyone should play. It\npaints the idea of risk management very vividly and helped me to see how far I have\ncomprehended all the video lectures I have paid rapt attention to in helping me\npractise it on a dummy community. Highly intuitive in every sense of it although\nit got on my nerves a couple of times but it posed forth the idea that risks\nare faced at every point in time and wise decisions have to be taken in either\ncurtailing  the risk or dealing with the\nconsequences that trail it (risk management) under a tension-free and enjoyable\nenvironment.\n\n                It’s a fine\nbalance between maintaining resources which are scarce (as the money to develop\nwas evidently limited) to managing risks as they arise. One important thing\nthat kept coming back to me was “not one single element should be neglected”\nthat is; acquiring knowledge, having an insurance cover and protection against\nthe impending risks. The couple of times I played it, I noticed that studying\nthe risk was a very important factor which I neglected the first time I played\nthe game as it helped my development \nimmensely but it didn’t necessarily prevent me from sustaining damages\nand neither did it help me curtail the damages when they did occur. This led me\nto combining protection and knowledge gathering which I for one considered a\ngood couple but then disaster struck and I was back right where I started then\ninsurance came into the picture. They formed an awesome synergy which I’m still\nfine-tuning to find a fine balance between, so as to achieve optimal returns\nand reach the highest level possible.\n\nLastly, If I were to develop a new version of the game, I’ll\nadjust a thing or two about how protection is acquired. I will make protection\navailable for purchase as insurance is so that it can be available faster but\nthe speed of availability will now depend on the cost of purchase for example\n$10 will take 20 seconds to get to level one protection and $20 will take 10 seconds\nto reach the same level one development stage and the time of development keeps\nreducing as the cost increases. I for one would have preferred this method to\nthe slider I have to hold down and still have my island being raised as slow as\na snail dragging itself up a hill. \n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk management: Multiple trade-offs were required to identify and manage risks, and then cope with the effects of negative events once they occurred. When playing the game, it was difficult to decide how many pods to place around the area. Once placed, insurance was always purchased (to maximum coverage), but the choice of raising the level of the area or instead researching comets (risks) was a difficult one. Raising the area costs money, but also time. Without sufficient time, the pods could not create enough revenue to proceed to the next level. This is the same as a community being held back from proper development. Spreading resources or consolidating them, spending time/money on competing resource demands, and balancing saving resources or upgrading existing infrastructure (pods) were questions than made the game difficult. When the community was well connected and well developed, and risks were inusred against, researched and their effects quickly addressed when they occurred, gave the best results.2. Multiple attempts at the game taught me that consolidating resources by upgrading a small number of pods was better for resilience than spreading resources across a larger number of less developed pods. Time and money spent repairing a large number of small pods was better spent maintaining a small number of upgraded pods. Also, when no comets were incoming this time was best spent raising the level of the area to prevent damage. Any time spent raising the area was best not to be at the expense of researching incoming risks. The more time spent researching risks, generally it was seen that the danger level decreased (severity and chance of impact). This indicates that a closer look at potential risk can show that an initial assessment can tend to be more inaccurate.3. Once change that I would make to the game would be to have some comets come in without any warning at all. This would show that some risks cannot be seen until they arrive. However, the same steps that need to be taken for known risks (comets) would always need to be taken. Having this change would just show that even if the horizon appears clear, there is always the chance of a negative impact so there is never any room for complacency. Risk management practices should always be in place, even in times when it appears there is little or no risk in the near future. ",

            "reflection": "The role of Risk Management was fundamental for the developing of the game's community. The research was important to know what proporcion of problem was going to affect your community and also to create connections between the single entities, just like a kind of \"insurance net\". Protection is a strong mechanism to avoid a lot of damages and interruptions in the development of the community. Insurance was useful to face situations that the community could not afford with his own resources.I played the game more than once and I have reached the 4th level only managing in an balanced way the various variables in the game, without thinking only in development and using the research as a way to prepare, prevent and protect. In my first attempts I wasn't using correctly the protection sistem, focusing principally in a rapid upgrade of the community, but every time that a big comet arrived I had to restart or pay for a lot of damages. It was pretty fun and it also gave me the possibility to understand how difficult is managing a community or something like this, there's always an obstacle that you have to prepare for.I think that the game represents only the \"noble part\" of risk management, in other words you may lose the game because you didn't managed in a balanced way the mechanisms that you have in your hands, but not because you managed them in a bad way, like happens in the real world. The possibilities that the game gives you are only to spend in useful things the community resources, you can spend them for protection, that it's not bad, in research, insurance or development, but none of this things are bad. In a real country, a lot of times governments spend resources in totally unusefull things for the community, subtracting growt opportunities.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to protect Alora from comets (shocks) and cope with the damage when they hit, while also developing the community. The different choices that had to be made to achieve this were to raise the island (protection), research the comets approaching so as to minimize severity of their damage (knowledge), or purchase insurance to minimize the amount damage and repair costs when they hit. Raising the island cost money and time, and put development on hold; researching the comets was time-consuming and often took time away from planning or advancing pods; and purchasing insurance cost a significant amount of money that could have been put towards development. All three had an immediate effect in terms of their cost but a later, and usually larger, effect in terms of benefit or pay-off. In regards to choices, only one of the three could be pursued at a time, and the order in which they were pursued greatly impacted development and the player’s success in advancing to the next level. For example, in some levels it would have been possible to raise the island while you were still approaching the development goal, while in most levels it was only wise to do so after you reached your development goal and had extra savings/green to spare in case a comet hit and damaged your pods. Another choice that often had to be made was level of insurance - if a comet was approaching and likely to hit and damage your island, yet you could only afford the first level of insurance, it was best to purchase it but if you later wanted to upgrade to the highest level, you had to pay the full amount of the highest level, rather than the difference between the level you already had and the new one you were purchasing. Having played the game more than once, the first few times I assumed the best form of risk management would be to raise the island so as to prevent comets from hitting and damaging Alora at all. I didn’t realize how much it cost or how likely some comets were to hit and so I never advanced past the second or third level. After the first few times, the game became more stressful as I learned to appropriately balance the amount of time and money I spent on each of the three resources. Oftentimes, I learned that it would be wisest to purchase insurance first then research the closest comet as much as possible and make sure my developments were in green before I attempted to raise the island - there were a few times when I didn’t even get to raise the island at all during the level.This really helped me understand the concept and possible disadvantages of behavioral biases. If I could change one simple thing about the game, it would be the community connections part. I would make it so it would not only be tied to research, but was instead a general part of the game also somehow tied to protection and insurance. Also, I would try to make it so that it is not all or nothing - for example, I would vary the damage so that not all pods/communities are damaged completely or at all. The game would be too overwhelming if each pod had its own form of insurance, research and/or protection, but it would still be helpful to make the point that not all communities are impacted equally and that not all communities collaborate in the same ways.",

            "reflection": "The aim of the game was to manage environment from certain and/or uncertian risks of pollutions. To advance prepare for possible risks, my first step was getting important knowledge such as the level of shocks, aftermath of potential damage and conditions after than. I tried to build more green areas as much as I could to reduce the level of damage and increase benefits. I clearly saw that much more green areas means much less damage in the game. Regarding to severity and chance of hit, I could estimated potential and have actions to grow our community. After having some shocks, I tried to recover the damaged and boosted protection by building new plots and facilities. Another important fact is cost analysis in the game. After each hit of comets, I needed to spent money to recover the damage. Obviously, if you are not financially secure for risks, you can not protect and rebuild your community. In my first play, I didn't pay attention for insurance plan, therefore it was financialy hard to replace my loss. In next game, I was so carefully when I manage repair cost. To get more benefits, having a really good insurance plan is also very significant as much as having useful knowledge, protection plan and coping plan. I think that another important part is having institutional response to get more advantages and to decrease possible loss. When I moved to higher levels of the games, I noticed having more pods helped me a lot to have more green areas and to mitigate the level of damage. To simplify, I learned from this game that understanding the level of shocks or risks is the first step for risk management. We need to reduce the uncertainty and understand possible outcomes after hitting some devastating events by learning the chance of comet hitting and its impact. The second step is protection that means reducing probability loss and increasing benefits by having more green areas and building or upgrading pods. To change the station from bad to good, we need to have a good insurance plan and use money efficiently to recover damages. In the game, I could practice how to repair and rebuild my pods in cheap way right away.To develop the game, I would put more natural disasters such as earthquake, tsunami or flood. I would also put more options for purchasing coverages besides using money such as some objects or items.   ",

            "reflection": "Introduction\n\nThe\nrisk management game has giving me more insight on how important it is to\nadequately prepare for possible unavoidable future shocks. The power of knowledge,\ninsurance and protection from shocks cannot be over emphasized here. \n\n \n\n1.     \nThe role of Risk Management\n\nThe\nrole of Risk Management in the game is to protect\ndevelopment from unavoidable future shocks\nthat will negatively affect the progress of development; this could be achieved\nby doing the following:\n\n·        \nProvide\ninsurance to make it easier to recover from any future shocks\n\n·        \nAcquire enough\nknowledge and research to help make informed decision \n\n·        \nProvide enough protection\nto help insulate against shocks\n\nThe\nchoices and trade-offs that I made in terms of knowledge, protection and\ninsurance are;\n\n·        \nWhere the\nchances of the comets hitting is less, development and upgrading still goes on,\nsince the likelihood of suffering from a shock is minimal. This goes on with\nthe mind-set that there is insurance cover to help make repairs easier should there\nbe a hit.\n\n·        \nWhere the\nchances of hit is high but impact is minimal, development and upgrading\ncontinue as usual, since the shock will be minimal, I rely on insurance to make\nrecovery easier\n\n·        \nPurchase of\ninsurance is very vital to development; this is because the insurance help to\neasily recover from shocks. Higher coverage of insurance per the game, made\nrecovery less expensive.\n\nPreparation\nfor risk affects development in the future. This is because knowledge about\nrisk, insurance and protection from shocks that hinder development, are done\nwith the purpose of increasing resilience to possible future shocks.\n\n \n\n2.     \nHow the Game was played\n\nAfter\nthe first time of playing the game, I increased the coverage of insurance for subsequent\ntimes I played the game; I also reduced the rate at which I was developing new\nplots. The following are the things I learnt from the game:\n\n·        \nThe wider the\ncoverage of insurance, the easier and less cost of repairs when shocks hit.\n\n·        \nIncreased knowledge\nreduces the severity of shock, it also helps to make inform decision to\ninsulate you from the possible future shock\n\n·        \nThe more\ndeveloped a plot is, the higher the cost of repairs\n\n·        \nDevelopment should\nnot be rushed, since unplanned development will end up putting you at a greater\nrisk\n\n·        \nWell planned\ndevelopment provide enough protection that makes cooping and recovery easy \n\n \n\n3.     \nProposed change\n\nThe\nresilience level of each developed plot should be indicated in other to help\nmake the player make decisions based on research knowledge with regards to the\npossible future shocks. For example people living in a flood prone area should\nbe made aware of how risky it is to live in a flood prone area. Hence the need\nto either build better drainage systems or build houses that protect them from\nthe floods, or move from the area and resettle elsewhere. ",

            "reflection": "Learning\nform the risk management game, risk horizon.The first difficulty\nI faced was to understand the game works, what thing is doing what. After\nunderstanding each actions possible, you can start to focus on how to manage\nthe risks, and the strategy you want to use. \n\n As an unexperienced’s in risk management, I\ndid the most stupid thing and contrary to all the principles of the course. I\nused the main part of my resources to focus on an action. At least this\nintuitive action helped me to understand each actions you could take. And then\nmore and more I changed my strategy to use all the power at disposition.  I started by using a lot of protection,\nresearch and then the development.\n\n Then after a few try and a better\nunderstanding of each actions. You understand what all the lessons said so far,\nthose are my feedback from my play:\n\nThe\nrole of research, is here to help you to gain knowledge. This knowledge, about\nthe chance of impact, the force of it. Give you the information needed to take\nthe best or the least bad decisions. It also easy and not too costly to use. After\nknowing the effect and the hinted chance of the comet, you can think about the\nway to invest your money. If the impact is lower than your protection,\nyou can be considered as safe and invest in development. \n\nIf\nthe severity, can be managed by improving by one level or maximum two (at the beginning)\nby protection, the protection is the safest and most durable way to manage the\ncomet. If\nthe severity cannot be managed by protection, or at a too expensive cost. The\ninsurance, would help to mitigate the cost of the damages. But the protection\nthat have already been setup, will also help you get a lower damaged cost.  The game, is really helpful to understand and\nschematize the different action that can be taken to mitigate the risk. With\nonly three factors (protection, research and insurance), and a development to\nmanage it is tricky to do. And I needed several try, to get a functioning strategy\nat least until the level 4. In a real situation, the research wouldn’t be so\nclear, and not so mathematic, you would also have to fight the human factor,\nand all the obstacles not only the resources obstacles. It does really help to\nget a first approach of managing the risks for development. \n\n",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon\nGame simulates the three important factors needed for effective risk management\naspects before the shock occurs: knowledge, protection and insurance. The player\nhas to balance between them and the development of the city he has to build up\nand enlarge. The trade-offs between development and risk management costs, as\nwell as the choice of combination between the research, the increase of the\nprotection of the city or the amount of coverage as the insurance has to all be\ncalculated and combined in the right way so that the city can advance and be\neffective in the risk management against the waves. In the beginning the cost\nwas not as sensitive to the methods applied, so I was able to use the maximum\ninsurance coverage offered and still spend enough amount of the budget on the development\nof the city, however as the levels advanced, I had to make harder choices\ninvolving more trade-offs.  I played the game\nseveral times and realized that by being overcautious I did not put enough amount\non development, so I realized through trial and error that the optimal choice\ndoes not mean the best and highest cost of protection, but the most efficient\ncombination of research, protection and insurance. I started choosing lower\npercentage of coverage and therefore lower insurance price, but focusing more\non the research that was also giving me more means of financing for further\ndevelopment. I personally loved the idea that having better research means more\ndeveloped city which in real live and country development shows the important role\nof education, knowledge and science on the well-being of a country or a nation.\nand last but not least, I used protection based on the research I did for each comet\nwhich allowed me to minimize the amount of impact and therefore use lower\nprotection level. In terms of building the city, I decided that quality is\nbetter than quantity and started off with lower amount of buildings, but more\nupgrades of their appearance. Then I managed the amount of buildings and\nupdates based on the resources available and the task I needed to complete. The\ngreatest lesson I learnt from the game is that balance is the key to\ndevelopment and risk management and the needs of the country and its resources\nshould determine the ways and the means used to effective risk management and\nadvancement. The game definitely shows the resilient   relationship\nbetween development and risk management. Lastly, the Risk Horizon Game shows\nthe importance of the relationships between the members of community to cope\nwith the common threat. Being united and living in community is what help us\nsurvive and develop. \n\nAmongst\nthese lessons, in my opinion, the game may suggest other\nmeans of protection to be used over longer term horizon. For example, in\nBulgaria, the place where I live, we experience floods and other natural\ndisasters relatively rarely, so the state and the population tend to\nunderestimate the risks and the problems. The institutions also tend to\npostpone the obvious risk management policies to keep in cleaner state the\nchannels and the drainage systems in the cities. This problem, addressed in the\nvideo talks and the report as well, shows the importance of the long term\nhorizon investment in risk management. That is why, in my opinion, the game\nwould be a bit more realistic and challenging if it offers a forth tool that\nwould be a longer-term protection policy against the waves or more severe\nnatural disasters that happen once in several levels but need a  bit more different policy.    ",

            "reflection": "The role of the risk management in the game\nwas to evaluate all the possible risks and find out a solution by using the components that we have seen this\nweek.A general valuation must be done on all the factors present in the game: natural calamity, development times, protection, research and insurance.The first time that I played, I focused myself\non the construction so I built as much I could, when I lost the first time I realized that I needed also to protect everything with a correct insurance that could help in case of disaster.\nWhen I lost again I decided to focus my attention also on\nthe research.\n\nSo I started again with another idea on my\nmind and I focused on the three components of the risk management.\n\nDuring the game I decided to focus my attention on the research in order to try to reduce losses. Knowledge can help people to understand the nature of the risks and can help to decide\nhow to act and in the game was possible to see how the research could change the negative effects of the meteor impact. As we have seen in the game development and research run together. We need to be prepared so we need to invest time and money on the research and than with the obtained results we can start thinking about how to plan the development. Research, information and knowledge are useful but not sufficient. In this case the impact was inevitable even if we had all the information about that so the next step was to analyze the\nright insurance and a good protection.\n\nI decided to pay 1 dollar every time to cover the possible losses and in this way added more protection to my project. Protection includes any action to prevent\nnegative shocks and it can be self-provided, purchased from the market or\nprovided publicly. But protection cannot completely eliminate the\nrisk so in this case the insurance could help to reduce the negatives effects of\nthe shock.\n\nOne thing that I have done in the game\nwas to buy an insurance for all my buildings in order to be covered and be helped\nin case of damages. Insurance allows to be covered for something that could happen but we are not sure about that, and with this cover we are induced to invest more time and money on a project. With the right cover we can restart after a disaster without spending a lot of the resources we have so we can focalize again on the project and continue the development.\n\nOn one hand I realized that be ready and know risks allow to act in order to protect and defend the development done at the time but on the other hand I also understood that, as well as in this game and also in the reality, the risks sometimes are evident but the\namount of the losses are unpredictable. The only thing that we can do is be prepared and organized in order to prevent damages as long is it possible and reduce the negative effects. For this reason risk management plays an important role. Knowledge, protection and insurance are components that we need to consider every time that we want to talk about development as well as Incentives, information, behaviors and resources.  ",

            "reflection": "I  think the word \"Game\" describes pretty well my experience with \"Risk Horizon\". In the video lectures we have learnt that the benefits of risk management exceed the costs of it. So I thought the best would be to invest in protection. That was an epic fail. I didn't notice this little entry in the FAQ \"Whenever you are protecting, your pods are not developing. This is something you must keep in mind when you are attemtping to balance preparing for comets and reaching your goal before time runs out.\"So one trade-off is certainly to protect your village and develope it in the same time. I invested too much money in insurances at the beginning. I invested too much in research and protection. I was kind of over-protected (the money for the insurance was wasted, I chose the 75% one).An other trade-off consists of the way you would like to build your village. What is better, buildung lots of pods or upgrading them? I tried both possibilities many times, but I only achieved level 3. One main issue was the little implemented game before the wave hits the village. Although I invested in research, it didn't help me to protect and save the village. I first played the game on my notebook, but it is quite difficult to play with the touchpad and hit all the yellow glows in this short time.So I switched my computer and used a mouse. I changed my strategy. I invested in insurance, but only 33 per cent, otherwise the incentive not to build protection would be to high. This insurance was cheap, so I had enough money to develope my village. I built lots of pods instead of building one and only upgrading this one building. I think that money can't buy you development in this game if it is on your bank account. So I invested it as fast as I could. And the mouse did help me to get more protection for my village. An other problem I faced was the fact that I find it difficult to protect againtst big comets at level 2, especially if they hit you at the end of the game, so you lose your developement, because you don't have enough time to rebuild the village.I don't like the minigame. In my opinion it destroys the good idea of strategic risk management. It really is a game when you have to click dots. I don't like how the research works in the game (observation of comets equals research???) I would replace this system by a research buildung, where you can invest money and get predictions like \"In 30 sec a comet (4 bars +/- 2) will hit you. The +/- should depend on the level of that buildung.My little brother (10 year-old) played the game just for fun. And yeah, he achieved level 5. He didn't watch the videos of this course. I guess he knows how to use the mouse. Nevertheless I would be interested in a walkthrough of the game. Could you upload it after the deadline?PS I apologize for any spelling errors in advance. If you want, you can correct these.",

            "reflection": "REFLECTION FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME\n\nRisk\nmanagement in risk horizon game helped to avert damages that could have\nretarded development. Through research - which improved the time to establish\nlinkage with communities to minimise the impact of meteorites that struck,\nsecuring insurance, and protection, risk management helped to eliminate or significantly\nreduce the impact of meteorites that struck and offered the opportunity for\nfurther development in subsequent stages of the game. \n\nThroughout\nthe game, I made trade-off to help progress to the next stage. Notable among\nthem were situations where I sacrificed developing pots to secure insurance and/or\nprotection. During other stages of the game, I spent more time researching\nmeteors in other to secure ample time for establishing linkage with other\ncommunities to diversify risk and minimise shocks associate with meteorites the\nstroke.\n\nInitially,\npreparation for risk drained available resources (capital) and hence led to\nslow development. In the long-term however, adequate preparation served as a\ngreat platform to propel the channelling of resources into developing pods.\n\nIn\nplaying the game the third and fourth times, I channelled more resources into\nresearching and protecting my developments and it really paid off compared with\nthe first time where most of my resources were channelled into developing the\npods. It became so decipherable to me from the game that, research and\ntherefore knowledge acquisition is very important in risk management as it is\nthe foundation upon which choices can be made regarding the channelling of\nresources into insurance or development. I readily came to comprehend why\ncountries like Japan even in the challenge of all the risks they are exposed to,\nare more developed than a country like Ghana - that is well endowed with\nnatural resources and more so, exposed to relatively fewer and less devastating\nsystemic risks.\n\nIn Ghana,\ncitizens are posed with financial crisis notably, the depreciation of the Ghana\ncedis due to considerably high import of goods and service. However,\nindividuals are at the risk of losing family breadwinners to diseases (hypertension,\nmalaria, HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B), accidents and even death (GHS, 2007). Loss of\njobs specifically in the mining sector is also a common occurrence (The\nChronicle, 2014). On the other hand, Japan, is susceptible to volcanoes,\ntsunami and earthquakes (Science Channel, 2013). This greatly constrain their\nallocation of resources for risk management and development. Whereas research is\nhelping in forecasting the occurrence of these impending dooms that loom large,\nin other citizens prepare for the inevitable, other risks notably accidents,\nand sometimes death are unpredictable.\n\nBy designing\nsome pots in the game to be susceptible to liquefaction and sinking, decision\nregarding the use of resources can better represent idiosyncratic risks (losing\na job, falling victim to a crime or a disease) in the game. Moreover, by making\nthe ground for development susceptible to flooding in addition to the falling\nmeteorites, the systemic risks associated with countries notably Japan, Haiti,\namong others could be best depicted in the game. It is worth knowing that these\ncountries have to make trade-off in the use of their resources in preparing for\none risk or the other.\n\nIn\nconclusion, the game has provided more insight on the role of risk management\nin preventing damages that could retard development whiles offering diversity\nin the learning approach to this course.\n\nReferences\n\nGhana\nHealth Service (GHS) (2007).

            "reflection": "At first it was difficult but I noticed the improvement as I\nplayed along which made me think more strategically, things like: “I have\nenough insurance now, let me develop more pods or upgrade this one, as the pods\nwere being developed I would utilize time for research on the comets and learn\nmore about their severity which would have an impact once there were hits”.\nThis correlation of actions told me that even if you plan ahead, there are\nrisks that would be completely unknown or unexpected and translate in that deep uncertainty as it was the case when\neven though there was protection and insurance, the comet would increase its\nseverity suddenly beyond “the expected” causing a greater damage, this is\ncritical as you cannot maintain the telescope trained on the comet the whole\ntime as there is a need of balance in protection and benefit. \n\nThat would let all the advanced pods to a partial or total\ndestruction that would be beyond repair in the time allocated. I can see how\nthis relates to cases like big hurricanes (Haiti) where even if preparation and\ninsurance were available, the amount of shock produced would rend the\ninfrastructures almost to nothing.\n\nAs the planet increases the amount of pods and its\ndevelopment, the risks are higher and higher because the destruction a comet\nwould bring at those stages would create another effect: a set-back so the level of progress that society had would be sent\nback in time making the conditions of that social system go in a regression.\n\nI played the game many times each time improving and reaching\nhigher levels, as I played more, the experience from previous games helped me made\nbetter strategic decisions and I would value the importance of each area: research,\ndevelopment, insurance and protection as well as wealth generation, if I were\nto do some changes to the game, I would include a warning system that tells you\nwhen the level of protection is way lower than the expected severity of the\ncomet above level 4 and as the research gets deeper, so the protection measures\ncan be better prepared to establish a safe\nzone where you can reach a steady growth.\n\nNo doubt progress and set-backs belong to the road of\nsocieties’ evolution and as members of them we have the tools to improve and\nprogress which can be the case of new forms of energy or understanding climate\nchange and natural disasters for increased prevention, but also we have the\nresponsibility of halting the set-backs we also create in war, pollution and\nabuse of natural resources.\n\nThe name of Risk Horizon appeals to the reality of things in\nenvironments with risks, as you can never stop preparing, because the risks\nchange and what helped in the past might not work in the present, the weather\nis not constant and therefore  a risk\nmanagement plan for it has to be adaptable, predictions can be made, that would\nbe the base of research and analysis (studying the comets), improvements in\ninfrastructure, systems, plans and actions would reduce the impact or even\neliminate some risks at all ( vaccination or water sanitation) but there\nremains also another truth: as in the game where you keep an eye on the horizon\nfor risks you should also keep an eye on the horizon for new options, in\nanalyzing the comets, the people from Alora could discover another world that\nwould enable them to shift their civilization there once Alora would no longer\nhave the conditions to sustain their society. \n\nDavid Barrantes Hernandez\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "This game is a possible simulation of risk management in the development context. Comets represent risks, because there is a possibility of loss. Their basic characteristics are impact (severity) and likelihood. Moreover, those risks are measurable but implications are uncertain. Confronting comets means possibility of damage to our development, so you try to prepare for them (research; knowledge), get insurance, and later cope with effects. So, this game brings together basic characteristics of risk management and tries to simulate how to prepare, confront and cope with risk. When I played this game I had to make choices on how to balance between growth and coping with risks, how much to pay for incurance, how much time to spend on research and on which comets, and how to protect. My strategy was to get insurance, try to spend as much time on research as possible, protect agains the \"waves\", and in the meaintime grow my community. However, similar as in the real life, risks are uncertain, and sometimes loss is bigger than expected. Protection in this game help me to become resilient - to faster recover from negative shocks - sometimes immediatelyor in the next level. Thus, good protection was an important part of achieving better development.After playing this game more times (I reached level 4), I spent more time on research as I found out this helped me to better prepare and cope with effects of damage. What is more, when I played this game first, I tried to grow my community as fast as possible, but after playing it more times, I upgraded my slots slower as I paid more attention to managing risk and balance growth as this helped me to develop my community in a more predicted way. All in all, I learned, in a simplifed way, why knowledge, protection, and insurance are important. This elements help us to manage negative shocks; prepare and cope with shocks. In a new version of this game, I would recommend to include different kind risks. I would not make this game more difficult but add some more risks as this would make this game more realistic. Those risks could be risks of drought if there is no rain, risk of disease, or risk of floods (these are also risks we face in our ocuntry). Regarding gamelaplay, it would also help us to continue game from the level we reach instead of playing it from the beginning. As I understand, the aim is that you like playing this game, so this small change would add to better gameplay. ",

            "reflection": "Risk management's role in the city of Alora was to help reduce the developing city's vulnerability by implementing the measures needed to make Alora more resilient while it develops to its full potential.  As the city grew the more protection and insurance it needed.  Now that came at a cost.  The trade off was while in the process of acquiring knowledge about the risk, you would be confronted with gaining the right amount of protection and insurance which at the same time would put research and development on a halt, and all three came at a cost whether it be financial or time wise.  Preparing for risk affected the development process in that  (1) preparation came at a cost and as a result sometimes there was not enough money and time between the hazards to continue with developing the city.  (2) As the risk increased so did the cost of development and risk management. Played this game more than once.  What was done differently was that the city was not developed too quickly, more time was spent on research, and acquired the best insurance from onset.What was learnt from this game was (1) knowledge is key, yet you need to balance when is the right  time to do so without risking too much (2) each hit from the hazard decreased your protection and cost you time and money to rebuild (3) time and cost is a factor in research, development, protection and insurance (4) the frequency between events left the city vulnerable, it limited the time needed to do research, acquire protection even when insurance with the best coverage was purchased, or develop at the rate one desired.  Too much of a rapid development hindered time and money to acquiring knowledge.  Sometimes concentrating on one factor such as protection, lost time and money and did not give enough time to gather the knowledge about the hazard, which still left the city vulnerable.  In the end there must be enough time and money for development and risk management.  There is no perfect balance between risk management and effects of the risk.  However, having implemented all factors of risk management decreases the effects of the hazard.  Yet having frequent hazards increases your vulnerability because you have not had enough time or funds available to strengthen your resilience from the last  event.  So why risk management when even though the city implements all factors of risk management, it is still left picking up the pieces especially if the frequency of the hazards are so close together?  Money, having some is better than having none at all.  Insurance will cover at least 75% of rehabilitation.  When residents of the city see that policies were put in place, development shows progress towards restoration, it fortifies the residents, gives them hope and most times will encourage majority (not all) at least those who can afford to, to learn and build their own resilience.  But what about the poor and vulnerable who cannot afford insurance and the vulnerable areas?  Risk management -  if the research is done properly, then the city should know where the first places to implement the mitigation measures.What to change about the game, nothing because it is a game not reality,  but as a platform in showcasing risk management, then add people, because people bring dynamics.",

            "reflection": "This game really shows that an optimal adjustment of choosing which tool to use, to what extent and when, defines how successful the risk management can prove on the long term. The anticipation, the energy deployed to achieve a level of protection high enough to go through the comet waves safely, all the steps taken timely are defined through the same logic that was introduced as key elements of Risk Management. Preparation is here materialised into Knowledge acquired from studying the comets while they cross the sky, Protection is gained from the height the platform is raised, and Insurance is applicable to the environment built, proportionally to the installations developed. Then, Coping is illustrated by the post-impact actions available : recovering thanks to Insurance benefits, and obviously repairing the damaged pods.Technically, with comets falling from the sky, managing the risk taken by the community does not allow for a second chance. I needed it though, and a trial and error approach was indeed pretty efficient in order to reach a perfect management.The metaphor of this little piece of land constantly bombed is quite accurate: being too greedy, building all possible pods without investing in upgrading them will show inefficient. Being excessively protective, raising the level of your land too fast, will leave you with no money, and not enough power to reach your goal.At the same time, not defending against the comets will result in too much damage that even the insurance will fail to protect.At last, spending some precious time on research might lower the risk, both its occurrence and its importance.If I had to re-develop the game, I would add variety in the risk encountered, so that the player would have to adapt in-game. The recurrent risk of falling comets make them fall into two categories only: those that will hit and generate damage, and those that won't, being too unlikely to hit or too weak to affect the community. Therefore, a routine sets up: the response is systematic and is influenced only by the efficiency of the player to reach the milestones of security timely (building enough upgraded pods fast enough to pass the levels, raising the level high enough). The beauty of a real-life situation is the variety of risks that impose different responses to be properly prepared. For that matter, strategies fit to anticipate a risk might be counter-productive when applied to another risk. It is once again the knowledge of the nature, frequency and impact of each risk that will determine the appropriate protection to develop. It is to be noted that readiness to face a risk can also be efficient when applied to another, and it is the synergy of actions that will reveal sustainable on the large scale of Risk Management. Hence, I would definitely instigate that notion into the framework of the game, for instance through a tough compromise: isolating from the waves by raising the platform up would bring the community out of range of a capital resource (like food from fishing, for instance) and a seasonal arrangement would have to be understood by the player in order to deal with both needs.",

            "reflection": "First of all, let me say that this game is a very good way to learn a cost-effectiveness calculation, which estimates of the likely costs and benefits of risk management. 1) The role of risk management in this game is protecting\nbasic livelihood (pods) in the\ngiven territory (Alora) as\nwell as promoting risk taking (by developing livelihood and making\nchoices). There are also\nmany direct and indirect risks-sharing mechanisms. These include: self-insurance at\nthe state level, market-based tools (such as hedging and insurance instruments,\nincome associated with foreign assets, external borrowing from international\nmarkets, and current account adjustments1), international labor mobility (such\nas through immigration and emigration), implicit hedges provided by\nmacroeconomic flexibility, and transfers and access to credit from\ninternational financial institutions (IFIs), and bilateral swap arrangements[1].\nThus, for example, I preferred to buy\ninsurance as soon as possible as well as to make a deep research. After some\ntime of course extensive preparation affected the development.\n\n \n\n2) Effective\nrisk management can provide both resilience to withstand adverse events and the\nability to take advantage of development opportunities. Thus effective risk\nmanagement consists of combining the capacity to prepare for risk with the\nability to cope afterwards, while pitting the upfront cost of preparation\nagainst the probable benefit. A strong risk management strategy consists\nof four components: knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping. Even though from the first time I played the game I\nhave reached 5th level, I couldn’t reach the next level even when I\nplayed it second time. I believe that my main disadvantage was the lack of\ndevelopment as a result of not taking risks. I have mainly put my efforts into\nthe preparation process. If I were to play again, I would try to put more\nefforts into development in order to effectively manage the risk.\n\n \n\n \n\n3) Facing risk and\nuncertainty is one of the most difficult challenges for individ­uals,\nhouseholds, communities and countries. Global financial crises, civil conflict,\ncrime and criminal violence, climate change and natural disasters, infectious\ndiseases, and volatile food prices are only a few of the many events and\nprocesses that can deepen the sense of insecurity in today’s rapidly changing\nand globally integrated socio-economic environment. Therefore, I would propose\nto make more real connected with a real risks which country may face or risks\nwhich can affect individuals.\n\n\n\n[1]\nManaging Risk for Development: International\nRisk Sharing by Joshua Aizenman\nand İnci Ötker-Robe, June 26, 2013 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNWDR2013/Resources/8258024-1352909193861/8936935-1356011448215/8986901-1380568255405/WDR14_bp_International_Risk_Sharing_Aizenman.pdf\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "     In the game, the role\nof risk management was to demonstrate how risk management operates in the risk chain.\nThe player had to prepare and cope with shocks to their community and cope.  To do this, the Luminator had to decide what to\nbalance preparation for the potential shock of a comet strike and ensuing\ntsunami with development of the community of Alora. Preparations for Alora included\nresearching comets (knowledge), purchasing insurance, or raising the elevation\nof the community (protection). The better the preparation directly correlated\nwith how well you would be able to cope with a comet strike and continue\ngrowing.\n\n     Every choice had different results on Alora’s development.\nResearch cost money, but impact on development didn’t help until the community\nnetwork was mobilized after the comet strike. Insurance was costly and show\nresults unless the community suffered damage, but then the speed and cost of\nreplacement was based on the amount purchased. Finally, the option I relied on\nmost, was raising the elevation of the community. I found that raising the\ncommunity to an appropriate height provide the best protection most of the time.\nHowever, this was enhanced by having minimal insurance and decent money reserves\nto prevent absolute destruction.\n\n     While I made it\nto level six my first try, and lost, I still tried several different scenarios.\n First I balancing everything to almost\nexacting standards, which required a lot of monitoring and quick movements\npost-shocks. To see if that was the best method I tried other development\nstrategies, tis included buying maximum insurance, building the community\nslowly in waves or all at once, and raising the community to the safest point. Focusing\neverything on one aspect was never as successful as the first attempt. I\nlearned that it is very difficult to get everything perfectly balanced, and as\nthe reading mentioned, you can’t expect to protect from all shocks.\n\n     A change that I\nwould make to the game would be to add a meter that tracks the population’s\nsatisfaction with the Luminator. During the game one of the comments between\nlevels was that the citizens of Alora enjoyed seeing constant construction. I\nbelieve this satisfaction meter would simulate the political considerations a\npolitician must face from their constituency when wanting to stay in office and\ncould likely affect decisions the Luniminator would make take in order to keep\nthe population appeased, a reality faced by governments making risk management\ndecisions.",

            "reflection": "Playing the game Risk Horizon is a revelation on many levels. First important realisation comes from the fact that it is nearly impossible to progress far, respectively it costs a good deal of effort, when you try to play for the first time not precisely knowing the rules. Already at the beginning I confirmed one of the pitfalls of human mind that was discussed in one of the lectures before - overconfidence. To start with, I eyeballed the rules and logic, and set to play. However, as the game picks up momentum, the pressure comes in, and it is nearly impossible to keep up for more than three levels before you are crushed by failing economy of your small Pod State.\nThe whole (very simplistic) model first shows perfectly well how important information is and how one decision (say, investment into insurance, or an economy-growing pod) influences outcomes in the future. You need both, that is for sure - pods and insurance, one for now, to have the powerhouse of economy steaming on, the other for the future. But it is the classical of the problems of running a economy - do we invest now into something that has an immediate effect, or into something that will/might materialise only in the future. It makes me smile a little to realise how difficult we would make the game by adding one more variable - corruption. That would eat from our ability to predict, delegate resolutions, and the power of the economy.\nAnother interesting thing is finding the balance between self-defence and insurance. I am pretty convinced that there is a great variety of people that do not know exactly how to find the equilibrium - they on one side might purchase the most expensive insurance and leave the rest to chance, sometimes that works for them, sometimes it does not. Others might think investing into insurance is a decent bag of money, I better invest it into something that will give me more return and bit by bit build my own resilience to disasters (which might end up being the most expensive option). Others go the middle way. One way or another, an important revelation is that during a lifetime, people, families, companies, states, or countries eventually will get hit and there will be damage, regardless of the preparations, planning, executive work, or insurance. I think that when you invest a great deal of effort into risk management, in the corner of your mind you hope that as a result, any damages must as a function be entirely avoided. But they most likely will not and the resulting psychological suffering moves individuals to desperate states, from which it might be very difficult to come back.\nI believe that after the waters calm down, like in the times of tribes, communities should be part of a feedback sessions to see what went wrong, what could be done better next time, and to be shown in a simple way how their common action helped to keep the territory afloat as much as it was possible. From a reflection upon this they should get a feeling that preparations do make sense, and also a better access to those, who crucially have the most responsibility (or avoid responsibility) within their community, or country, for that matter. In the long run, it is a case of making decision makers accountable directly to their people. I am now living in a South American country and REAL accountability is what here no one seems to be assigned. And it is not difficult to tell. Sweet words, no change.",

What I would propose could be a different scenery; something more realistic according to the situation of violence or droughts living in these days in my country , that allows people to think about behaviors of community, resorces we have to cope with that situation, information given by the government and obtaining by the people to understand the proper way to face it.    I think the idea of activities like the game is to learn how in differents situations someone is responsible for the decision made considering the cost benefit analysis, it menas doing a quantitative analysis of the cost of mitigation of the risk and balancing it with the benefits of the measures taken.   ",

            "reflection": "Q1: Throughout the game, I was able to understand and apply the three elements of risk management in the following ways:Confronting the risk: Doing nothing about risk, could lead to greater failure. It is important to take certain step to reduce the impact of risk. In the real world this could translate to saving lives, preventing a crisis or unleashing an opportunity that would not have been realized. Preparing:Thinking through a strategy, keeping my eyes on the horizon as well as investing time in research helped me advance to higher levels. Risk preparation should be holistic. Focusing on one aspect  e.g.buying insurance may not  fully insulate one from the impact of the crisis at hand.Coping: Once hit by a comet, it was important to do repairs. This helped the community to suffer less damage caused by subsequent comets.The choices and trade-offs were first to ensure that I was applying the information provided at the beginning of the game. I also found it useful apply learning from the discussion forum which helped me propel myself to level four. Second was to place greater emphasis on research which helped me analyze the severity of the comets as well as the chances of being hit. I tried as much as possible to ensure that the level of protection matched the severity level especially where there was a high chance of the comet hitting the pods. Thirdly, I realized the need to balance advancing development against investing in protection or insurance i.e. developing new pods vs upgrading the current one.  The maximum amount of insurance did not always pay off and it was better to save the resources to use in other areas. Although preparation for risk was an intense and sometimes costly exercise, it helped develop a more resilient community overtime. Q2: I did play the game more than once and the main things I learnt that helped me do things differently where:Keep your eyes on the horizon: It was the rather obvious thing to do but not always the easiest with a number of things to monitor.Research: This I could not emphasize enough. It helped me make informed decisions on how much emphasize to place on protection and insurance. It also helped buy time.Community: It helped to work with the community to reduce the impact of risk. After while it became difficult to monitor all tools and therefore it helps for risk management to be a collective effort.Indicators: It was useful to have the light on the left as an indicator of whether i would achieve the level. Monitoring and profiling risk is key particularly where there is high risk high impact this would require better management.Knowledge is power and cannot be neglected. Preparation will go a long way in managing risk. Q3: If I was to develop a better version of the game, i would include the following:The ability to move from one level to the next without having to start all over again. In some instances it was caused by a 'fatal error;Clearer feedback at the end of each round. I was not clear what exactly I was doing wrong.I would design a different format of inputting some of the choices similar to the insurance one so that one is clearer about the choices they are making.",

            "reflection": "1.\tThe role of risk management in this game is to balance the amount of effort (money) invested into development, protection and research for the successful growth of a community. By investing in the community development, which in turn increased the economic return, one had to an also invests in protection to reduce the propensity of a crisis, by avoiding negative impacts from the shock (the Asteroid hitting Earth). Whenever time was not enough to cover building protection, then insurance was a wise investment, which could reduce the amount needed to cover the damages, thus allowing you to keep developing at a constant speed, instead of spending large amounts in repair. Preparing for risk as investing on protection took some time and resources away from investment in development. Preparation was in the end the best type of investment to avoid the risk not only in response to the direct threat. It had to be done ahead of time, as sometimes a high-risk of impact and highly damaging meteor could come very fast. Therefore preparation ahead of time was necessary and it was the biggest differential factor, more than insurance, \n\n2.\tI played the game several times and once I realized that the trick was to invest in protection to avoid damages from meteors, I did not spend any resources on insurance and had more available to further the development and upgrading of the community. I learned that time is precious when you invest in protection, you do not have the time to invest in the development of the community. One has to choose carefully where the community needs the most support according to the needs, imediate and future Balancing the amount invested in insurance, development and protection was the trick to reach the fifth level of the game. Research also helped, but whenever the development was being accomplished, in accordance to time. Whenever the minimum time limit was on red, meaning development was not taking place as it should, barely any efforts were given to research, a  commonly found in real life as well.WHen I was in Level 5, I was doing very well with a fully functioning upgraded community, but realized to late the protection from the asterois and tidal waves had gone down after a few minor hits and  a highly damaging Asteroid came. I had been investing too much in development and forgot to insure a highly developed community. The damages were catastrophic and I had to spend all my resources in repairing the community.\n\n3.\tOne major change I would propose is to turn the theme of this game into a farming/rainfall insurance game.The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter where I live would not make much sense to me now. However, I do work with Africa a lot in wastewater treatment and reuse as fertigation for areas with lack of rain and groundwater. I would like to see a game like this in respect to the effect that rainfall insurance cause in India though. I am not entirely clear on how it works. The fact that farmers can pay the insurance when there are crops producing is understandable. However, if it does not rain, and the farmer does not have any product to sell, how could he have had afforded the insurance in the first place? Therefore, I would substitute the pods for crops and the asterois for droughts to see how this system is working.  Is it true that farmers only get their security insurance payments in case of no rain and he has produced no crops? ",

            "reflection": "Risk\nHorizon game brought me a lot of pleasure. It was a quite difficult game, I\nhave to play it twice to reach fourth level. The most important thing in the\ngame was to balance money spending between development (building or upgrading\nbuildings) and securing (terrain lifting and insurance).\n\nRisk\nmanagement is very important in the game. Without proper precautions you could\nlost all your buildings – cost of repairs could be so high, you wouldn’t get to\nthe goal before time. The best way to win in my opinion was to avoid danger\n(lift terrain so high, that the comet wouldn’t cause damage). But from the\nother hand concentrating too much on avoiding danger resulted in poor\ndevelopment and lack of resources – that was the reason why I had to start a\ngame for second time. But results of mistakes made in early levels was visible\nlong time after – it was hard to value if decisions I’ve made was right or not.\n\nIn the\nsecond run I concentrated more on development, and secure only slight above the\nminimum level that was required. I also did not put so much money into\ninsurance – damage caused by comet was so severe, it did not allow to continue\ngame on further levels (due to time of fixing) – so it was no sense to spend\nmoney on it. The main thing I learned is the right balance in money spending.\n\nI would\nshorten time of building fixes – on higher levels you are not able to win after\nbeing hit, even when you have the highest insurance, due to this time. In real\nlife you can split production and not keep all resources in one place – it\nmight increase the cost of business, but allow you to continue production even\nin occurrence of disaster – you lose only part of your power. This game\nunfortunately lacks in this – when you are hit all buildings are damaged. If I\nworked with developers I would introduce sort of production splitting. This\ngame is a simple model, but I think is a bit to simple – in real life you have\nto face many treats, with different impact factors and probabilities. In game\nyou have only one threat (but with different factors and probabilities) and\nalso one way to protect. This model Is to simple, and I thing in further levels\nother kind of danger and protection should occur.\n\nIn general\ngame is very good – it shows in simple way practical issues connected with risk\nmanagement, and proves that the best way to learn is to play.\n\n",

            "reflection": "QUESTION 1: In this game, the objective is to meet the\nAlora community development goals by building and upgrading pods.  Risk\nmanagement involves confronting, preparing for and coping with risks.  Players confront risks by observing meteors and researching their level of severity, probability of hitting and\ntime to impact.  They prepare for them by boosting their protection\nor purchasing insurance, and they cope with their effects by making connections in the aftermath of a shock and repairing pods.  As I played\nthe game, I found that I had to make trade offs between my development goals\nand managing risks.  For instance, if I didn't adequately protect against\nrisks, I would suffer losses that would set back my develop.  However, if\nI over-insured, , I would have fewer resources to spend on development.\n Finding the right balance between opportunity and risk was key to a\nsuccessful outcome (i.e. winning a level).  To achieve the right balance,\nI employed a strategy of ensuring that I had at least a basic level of\ninsurance as soon as the meteors started coming, and that\nI checked on the predicted severity of the meteors as soon as\nthey came into full view but were still a little ways out.  This gave me\ntime to increase my level of protection to match the severity of the\nworst incoming meteor if I needed to.  Using this strategy, I\nexperienced no damage in most cases. QUESTION 2: I was able to successfully complete up to\nLevel 4 of the game, but lost Level 5.  From this I learned that my\nstrategy of focusing on a mix of insurance and protection was not enough.\n I needed to place greater emphasis on knowledge/research and community\nconnections to continue to develop successfully as development progressed\nbecause the cost of insurance and protection were increasing at a rate that I\ncouldn’t afford if I pursued my previous strategy.  And, the cost of repairs\nto pods was also increasing, which also put back development considerably when\na meteor hit.  This led me to the insight\nthat successful risk management strategies in the past don't necessarily work\nas development progresses. The appropriate balance\nof knowledge, protection and insurance will change over time.  \n\nQUESTION 3: One issue where I live concerns the\nconstruction of a pipeline across land and an increase in oil tankers\ncollecting oil delivered by the pipeline.  The pipeline could break, causing an oil\nspill in the area of the breakage with severe negative outcomes for people and wildlife.  Similarly, the oil tankers could run\naground and spill out in the sea over a vast territory, again with negative\noutcomes.  Despite the risks, the pipeline and oil tankers are likely to\nbring significant economic benefit to the region.  Though the benefits of the pipeline and oil tankers will be\ngreat, they will not be evenly distributed - jobs are likely to benefit a few\nin a specific sector and to be short-term while a spill would affect many for a long time. To have players\nof the Risk Horizon game reflect on the realities where I live, I suggest a\nsubsequent level of the game could be structured so that the game’s incentive\nstructure changes.  In this round, the goal could shift so that players\nare rewarded for meeting their own (or an organization’s) financial targets,\n(e.g. Pod Construction Corp. only), but not the development of the community as\na whole.  Players could then be asked to reflect upon how their behaviours\nchanged in this round and to observe what effect this had on the community as a\nwhole.  \n\n ",

            "reflection": "Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development\nby Anca Maria Podpiera, Federica Ranghieri, Kyla Wethli, Norman Loayza\n\nJuly 12, 2014\n\nNick Pharaoh, Student\n\nWhat was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nRisk management played a key element in being successful (scoring your goal) in this particular game. Having been given the hints of building and up-grading, I made the choice of continually improving the island.\n\nKnowing that a meteor could strike at any time, there was plenty of incentive to both insure the property and improve the height of the land.\n\nThere is always an initial balance between spending for development, accumulating wealth versus insuring the property. However, when a disaster strikes, without insurance, along with the devastation of property,  also included is financial ruin.\n\n\nIf you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?\n\nThe one thing I would do differently, would be to develop the property at a more accelerated rate.\n\nThe main points appeared to be to develop the property quickly and insure your property to the proper level.\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nI would not allow the player to change the elevation of their property, thereby putting more at risk during the disasters.\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management played the most important role in the development of Alora world. There was no way the illuminator would have achieved the milestones set along the way without risk management. In managing knowledge, protection, and insurance, She was able to increase the rate of development, hence raising the bar.To achieve this, one had to balance the delicate act of growing the community and preparing for the potential threats. The use of research was paramount in guiding the type and amount of development. Research provided the information on the probability and intensity of the hazards, and in turn gave an indication of how much insurance was needed. Many are the times that one had to spend more time on research at the expense of development -reason being that there was no point in investing heavily on what could be at risk without proper insurance. By doing research and predicting what was coming/what was known, one was able to pick the right insurance, hence cushioning the needed development.Community protection offered the last layer of protection against the intensity of threats. Risk management in the long run was responsible for the vibrant development experienced in Alora. Each of the four components of good risk management was costly in terms of money or time, but failure to manage would have had dire consequences.(Remember the Oh No! expressions that escaped your mouth every time your ponds were destroyed by the comets, and you didn't have enough insurance, and you had to start all over again--the frustrations!) To pursue opportunity, in this case development, one had to confront risk.2-   In playing this  game, I learned the importance of keeping a balance between research/knowledge, insurance, and protection. All these components are essential in managing risk and creating opportunities.3- I would probably want to represent some of the choices that people faced by these threats have to make when buying Insurance. It is not just a matter of how much you want to get but whether you can afford it. These are choices faced by many people not only in the developing world but the developed world as well.Secondly, I would incorporate  coping as a component of good risk management. I feel that this component was not well exemplified catered for in this game.  ",

            "reflection": "1. Risk management is essential to minimize the potential adverse impact and keep the plan (business/devleopment) on track. It also saves resources for other purpose (investment/development). My choice in the game was to identify and analyze risks as much as I can through broadening knowledge. Based on the information I have, I can select choice that have risks, and utilize mechanims or tool to deal with that risks such as buying insurance or building protection. Preparation for risks affect development in a number of ways. First, it can shape the direction of development in a way that involve fewer risks. In pratice, this can be in the form of resilient growth or development because if shocks materialize, the country can have resources and mechanims to deal with the shocks. 2. I would plan the development while understand about risks as fast and as much as possible. Once risk is identifed and analyzed, the protection and insurance needs to be in place to deal with potential shock. The main thing I learned from the game is the resource moblization both in terms of time and wealth is very important for the development and related risk management. Effiecient resource moblizatin for a specific targeted need information, knowledge, and effective decision/judgement. 3. I would add the \"unknown unknown\" factor. In real world, especially in developing countries, given the limed quality data, capacity, and governance issue, a bit of \" unknown unknown\" factor could shape gameplayer to give more importanc to insurance and protection.",

            "reflection": "I\nreally enjoyed the game. It has great lessons regarding the risk assessment and\nmanagement. First of all is evaluating the risk considering both the impact\nand probability. One can spend a lot of time reading about\nProbability/Risk Matrix, yet the practical experience plus the life\ndemonstration are different stories.  \n\nAlso\nkeeping busy securing-protecting- your already done development activities has\ngreat trade off as it will hinder upgrading or going to higher level in\ndevelopment. Environmental analysis –research- has to be a\nconstant to monitor and forecast future changes. It is worth mentioning that\nnot all risks need spending money and time to secure yourself of. \n\nAnother\ngood lesson is keeping the balance between vertical and horizontal\ndevelopment. Both should be run hand in hand. It is not good to focus\non vertical development in one area leaving another area underdeveloped. I\nused to work as program manager for healthcare development project besides my\nwork as a university lecturer for different topics related to management and\nmanaging policy change and I can say that balancing between vertical\nprogression and horizontal maturity of programs/courses delivery is a key\nindicator for the level of proficiency for who is in charge for any one of\nthem. \n\nThe fact that second\nlevel/layer development is more coasty than the first one. Watching your\ndevelopment program flourish in one area carries a lot of positive feelings that\nmy mask the fact that cost is high and getting higher. Even the running cost\nex. Insurance or recovery after risk attack. No need to say that the\ndevelopment indicator rises in higher pace after the first layer/wave of development.\n\nI used not to rely a lot\non insurance, et this game stimulated my mind to think of it\nrationally. It is much needed but one should calculate the level of expenditure\non insurance versus the probability and impact of potential risks. And all of\nthese should be expressed in monetary terms. Money talks even in development. \n\nThe game also has many\nareas for development such as:\n\n1.  \nImproving the\nquality of the graphics will make it more enjoying\n\n2.  \nProvide simple\nkey performance indicators for development areas/aspects with different impact\non the development bar will highlight the fact that real sustainable\ndevelopment need different interventions and each one has its own impact on the\ndevelopment index.\n\n3.  \nContinuing for\nthe previous area for development in the game, the interventions should hit\ndifferent areas for community development like education, health, security…etc\n\n4.  \nIt is mentioned\nin the game that the more you develop the more you will receive money. This should\nbe more indicative, for example you will receive X amount of fund when you\nreach for Y level of development.\n\n5.  \nThe game should\ninclude sense of Opportunity and how to turn risk into\nopportunity.\n\nFinally and as a\nconclusion, the game provides good example for the relationship between proper risk\nmanagement and sustainable development in symbolic manner and I enjoyed it big\ntime.    ",

It is very important to consider how decisions are made to optimally allocate resources so as to space and time according the importance of each.    I make hasty decisions due to lack of experience showed me the importance of an adequate knowledge gained from practice and not just theory.    In terms of protection and insurance, the environment is automatically and constantly changed, confirming the importance of anticipate the events to reduce or eliminate risks.    As I played the game took top deciciones regarding the administration of economic resources and minimize hasty decisions.    The main learning gained through the game was the importance of an adequate knowledge base and previous implementation of risk plans, also the whole collaboration of all project participants.",

            "reflection": "The game is really interesting since it gives you the opportunity to take decisions within a possible risk of a natural disaster caused for a comet and it shows you clearly how to work to achieve risk management objective: build resilience and achieve prosperity . \n\nIn the game the risk management is the key element to achieve development. During the game you learn how to prepare in face of a possible disaster and how to face the effects when the event occurs. What makes the experience unique is that in this process the game asks you to combine decisions in different but interconnected levels such as development, economic, knowledge, insurance and protection \n\nAs lesson learned, for example, in terms of protection you prove that it is important to make an effort to know the probability of occurrence of the event and also to measure the possible consequences. By doing this research it is possible to undertake protection measures that will reduce the impacts in case of a disaster.\n\nThe insurance is also pointed out during the game and shows that the more developments you have the more you have to pay for the insurance. This fact demonstrate that even is the cost of insurance is high it is a necessary action in order to avoid disasters affect the path to development. \n\nThe role of community is clear in the game because when a disaster occurs teamwork is key to reduce the impact in the society. \n\nSince I played the game only once what I would change if I play it again would be to be able to make more balanced decisions in terms of building new constructions and spending money in preparation. This because I think that may be I constructed new buildings too fast not always assuring its safety. \n\nFinally, I would only change a small thing about the game. My propose is to add a different kind of risk to the game so as you go truth the levels you have to take management decisions in a situation where you not only have to prepare and protect from a natural disaster because you also have to face with additional risk such as a financial crisis situation, or a technological disaster due to natural disaster such as in the case of Fukushima Disaster in Japan. \n\nI think this change  should be interesting since you can take more integral decisions in face of complex context that are more like the reality that we face in countries like Colombia. \n",

            "reflection": "1.\tReflection\nThe role of risk management in the game was to provide protection in the event of possible loss. Also, it required a strategy, planning and implementing decisions so as to develop the village fully. In addition, risk management helps the community to grow while being cushioned against risks and if the risks occurred, then it would help in minimizing losses.  \nTo make a good decision, I had to consciously plan to monitor the environment, assess the risks and take corresponding action. After citing a comet, had to analyze possibility of occurrence and if it did occur, then what would the severity be. The speed at which I took actions to some extent contributed to whether I would be caught up and hit badly, lots of losses or I would be ready for any eventuality.\nI also noted having immediate savings helped me to minimize damage. In addition, formal insurance helped me to rebuild destroyed pods and at a cheaper cost. \nIt was necessary to balance all the aspects, as the severity in the comet increased, so did the damage if it hit the pods. As my risk increased, I also found it necessary to buy higher amount of insurance because savings alone would not help much.\n\nAs I prepared for risks, development slowed down but because I had to do research and also take protective actions. Later on it was easier to develop because I had taken necessary protection measures. I now had time and less worry about risks. This is because I was constantly aware of what eminent risk and potential losses and ways to mitigate as well as cope.\n\n2. Learning\nI learnt that it is important to carry out research constantly so that you can gauge the elements you are exposed to vis a vis potential damage in the event of occurrence and take the necessary decision on whether to protect or to insure. Saving was also important in reducing the damage. The higher the safer it is to, in addition to protection, transferring the risk through insurance. \n\n3. Any change\nI would recommend protection not to be tied to raising the island only because each of the pods could equally be exposed to not only floods but also drought. \n",

            "reflection": "Reflection from the Risk Horizon Game\n\n\n\nDuring\nthe game, risk management had a central\nrole because I had to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the\nability to cope with the consequences.\n\n The preparation phase included the\ncombination of three actions: \n\n-         \nGaining knowledge by looking out into the space\nand learning the chance of the comets hitting and the severity of the collision,\n\n-         \nEnsuring protection against the waves,\n\n-         \nObtaining insurance.\n\nHowever,\namong them, I gave priority to knowledge\nand protection. I consider knowledge as a central element of every activity\nand devoting some time to it helped me to accumulate more time to create\ncommunity connections. Concerning protection, it allowed me to sufficiently protect\nthe pods and reduce the negative outcomes. Consequently I preferred to put\naside insurance, also in consideration of the limited amount of resources.Concerning the coping phase, I focused on assessing\nthe new situation and give priority to repair the pods because I knew that my\ntask was to develop the community as much as possible.The preparation for risk affected\ndevelopment because every decision related with building and upgrading pods\nhad to take into account the actions required by a proper risk management.\nResources and time devoted to risk management had to be weighed with a\ncontinuous and balanced effort towards the upgrade of the pods and, basically,\nan increase of the rate of development.\n\nI played the game more than once and,\nafter the first time, I improved my\ncapacity of balancing the actions required by preparation and coping. A\nlesson learned consists in the fact that a good preparation for risk had\nimportant implications on coping. In particular, a good protection against the\nwaves involved minor damages and costs to repair the pods.\n\n If I\nwas allowed to develop a new version of the game to better represent the risk\nmanagement choices, I would give more\nimportance and weight to the research, in order to better stress the\nadvantages of the research towards a better knowledge. \n\n In\nconclusion, the game gave me the chance to touch, in a practical way, the difficulties related to the choice of the\nbest mix of actions in risk management, in presence of a limited amount of\ntime and resources. The reality could certainly be more complex, but the game\nprovided an excellent simulation and taught me a good method to deal with the\ndifferent aspects related with risk management.\n\n \n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "I tried to play on Risk Horizon game for 6 - 7 times, but I still did not understand completely how to play it, how to use the tools, and tricks to win the game. The first 3 tries actually all I did were trying out how to work the game since the tutorial reading was not clear to me, but again, I never play any computer games, so this is very new to me. Aside from the game though, I learned more regarding the risk management, and how identifying risk, facing risk, study the risk, and preparing for the risk, can potentially giving the opportunity to reap bigger profit. One thing it strucked me on one of the video lectures that mentioning the tendency of people that 'easily forgetting' the risk when disasters do not happen for sometimes. It almost giving the presumption that it will never happen again. I actually ran into several people who own some business that terminated their insurances just after couple of good years, just to save money from insurance premium. This proves how easily people forgetting about risk when it's in fact still there, in exchange of small amount of saving.Another thing I learn from this week is how important it is to try to build safety net through the community.  Often community is willing to work together for the benefit of all, but sometimes what we need is just a few people who are willing to start it, and willing to run it. The ideal situation will be if those people are part of the community and have enough knowledge to organize it. After all, it does not need to be complicated and simple agreement will do. Trustworthy among members and the desire for every members to be successful are the keys.One of the obstacle I know that often faced by small business owners especially in developing countries are the high interest of loan. For example after the effort to get knowledge and study of risk management, and ready to  get a new tools, then how can get the capital to buy it? Borrowing money from the local bank, not only the interest so high, they cannot even get approved. A lot of time, their option are limited to family or private sector who give higher interest, thus making the risk even bigger to loose the investment. This fact shows how important it is for every business owners to build some type of organization for safety net or for the needs of resources. I actually know some homeowners in Indonesia that getting extra capital from the local group who together putting the money together, each of the member put same amount of money, and every month randomly select the member's name who would be able to use that total amount of money as capital for their business. Some member who has the need to get access sooner than other member actually is given a chance to bit lower amount of the money each of the member has to pay, in order for that person to win the bid. In this case, that member will get less total amount due to the bidding, but that can be seen as an early interest that being paid up front. Sooner or later every member will have their chance to the access of the money, and the last member though seems they have to wait and loose the 'value of the time', but  they will get the full amount as it was decided from the beginning and will save the money by giving the lower bid to the early bidders. This is a traditional way of getting capital from the local community that actually works good in certain area whose members are trustworthy and caring for each other without any type of forms nor complicated bureaucracy.",

            "reflection": "In this game, risk of being hit is the only danger threatening your gaining enough scores to win the game in limited time. So the capacity of risk management is crucial for players to win.Time management is crucial too. I always find there was not enough time to rise from the shock of hit. How to rank the priority and allot limited time to the three major tasks in order to reduce damage and gain more score, is decisive for success. But limited time often makes this three measures seeming conflictive to each other. They all need time, especially constructing the pods, raising the ground and researching. So you have to find a better strategy to arrange these three tasks.I played this game several times. In the beginning, I spent most time build pods to gain money and bought the most expensive insurance to reduce loss. The result of this strategy was that I invested too little time on researching, so the damage was so great that I had no enough time to regain sufficient scores to succeed. Then I made some adjust in time allotment. But this time, I spent too much time on researching, then I found the construction was too slow to gain the scores needed, too. So in the later rounds I constructed a pod first to gain start money, then I bought a low rate insurance to cover the possible loss. After that, I watched for falling stars to see how much time I need to research. If the chance of being hit is high, then before  investing much time to research, I started to construct several pods, so they could be built while researching. If the chance of being hit is low, I would continue to construct. And I found that if your preparation is enough, high rate insurance would be not worth it. And I found that use some time to raise the ground was worth your time. Raise the ground in precaution and research for enough long time, you wouldn't need spend much money on insurance, and you also save the time for reconstruction. Although I only make to level two, I still learnt a lot from this game. It forced you to choose something and give up something at the same time, and it made  me to discern the different natures of the three tactics of risk management. It's a wonderful and inspiring game. But if I could make a small amendment, I will make the research process a add up process rather than a always from zero one. Because in real life, if you keep on researching something, your knowledge and skill will increase, too. So you won't always start from zero. In this game, every time the stars threaten, research always begins from zero. If this feature could improve, I think it's more realistic and fair. ",

            "reflection": "The role of Risk Management in this game is to build a Framework which will permit the community of Alora to pursue its development and at the same time try to contain the risks from the fallings of comets.The choices I made was to build pods on the places where it is possible or where the research works on the ground permit.During the game I confronted some trade-offs .It was specially between informatiions from the movements of comets and the protection in place during the phase of construction.When the risks from the coming comets are hight and the protection in place are unsufficient , I suspend the building process and try to increase the level of protection in order to reach or go beyonddepass the level of comets threats. When I got the correct level of protection , I start again the building operations.The preparation of risk affect development immediately and in a long term if the process is well managed. You see the outcome increase when you maintain your efforts constant and this can be visible and sensitive. On the contrary if the preparation of risk management is not well planned you lost many times in redoing the works over a long period of times and this affect development on short and long term.If I have to play the game just one time , while building the pods I will watch closely the movements of comets. As soon as I notice that the level of risk from the comets are higher than the protection system in place , I will stop the building process and raise consequently le protection level.If I have to play the game many times , when I gain the first round , I will try to consolidate the result by applying the same principles I used before and also some insights I got before in terms of level of destruction and the adjustments to make on the assurance fees.The mains things I learned from this game are :The general framework of Risk Management;the impact of a good risk management on the research;Risk Management is not an linear process but an iterative process.If I am tasked to develop a new version of game for the risk management of my country I will choice amongst many others risks , the financial risk. I will change the comets movements by the movement of international financial system, this will represent the external factors of risks.I will assimilate the pod building by the running of business on the national territory by: households,enterprises, community.I will assimilate time to the fiscal year I will replace the measurement tool on the left by measurement tool of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP).The insurance system will be the international insurance system.The bar of protection on the right will represent the work  of administration to create a good environment for doing business.The research entity will consist of the community of various consultants who work for promoting business in the country.I will add an internal factor of risks , I will represent this by the movements of phenomen such as corruption , injustice ,unployment.These phenomenes will move in the country at the same time as the movement of international financial system. ",

Now while I played the game,I realized that risk management was an important tool that was to be used in the community.Since risk management is effective when there is a capacity to prepare in advance and cope afterwards,the three main tools which is knowledge,protection and insurance must walk hand in hand.but to enhance development,you need to be financially stable. The three main tools must work together to achieve an effective risk management,as these tools were applied in the game.first,knowledge must me applied,knowledge in form of research,and then protection is applied to shield when an actual shock takes place,insurance is then put in place to help compensate after a shock has been materialized..",

            "reflection": "The game showed us various aspects of risk management, the majority of them being assessing the magnitude of a risk, preparing to minimize the impact of a risk situation and to prepare for future situations keeping in mind the past experience. Basically, the game helps us to go through the fundamentals of risk management, which, if done effectively, could certainly lead to better opportunities and greater development.It is also important to know that development cannot take place at the cost of preparedness. A community, or any part of society has to take care of the risk involved while addressing a development issue.In the game, insurance was vital in case of post-damage situation, since it considerably reduced the burden when it came to redevelopment. But it has to be kept in mind that insuring at the cost of development, i.e. eating up essential resources to insure against threats is not viable towards achieving development targets. Knowledge is essential to minimize the risk involved by preparing better for the risky situation. Knowledge gained from past experiences, and ability to determine the threat involved goes a long way towards ensuring safety and stability. Without sufficient know how of the situation at hand only worsens the scenario, since even small threats could turn into huge risk situations.Protection is a vital part of risk and development equation, since sufficient protection insures the damage is minimized in case of a risk, and the impact is nullified if possible. Proper protection can promote safety, prosperity and development. I realised that using too many resources for protection and insurance hindered research and development, but at the same time, not having enough protection was detrimental to any kind of progress made as it had a certain negative impact due to the exaggeration of the problem at hand, without sufficient protection.I played the game twice, and during the second time round I realised that development takes place with proper safety and protection involved. Only development and little protection could prove counter productive. Also, the research done into avoiding the risk was more successful with sufficient protection in place. With proper risk management, development could last longer and the damage was minimized. During the second time round, my focus was on protection and aggressive development to compliment the research being done. It was important to beef up my defence before I could go for more development of the pods.If I was tasked with development of a new version of the game, I would like to have a system/power which predicts the possibility of risks, rather than only researching and getting the communities together during the time of a risk situation. Even with all the protection in place, the damage caused could be reduced drastically if proper prediction could be done. This way, the people would know whether to increase the protection level, or go ahead with more development if the chance and severity of a damage is low. Damages occurring in such a situation could be a potentially low risk situation which could promote more development, albeit, with proper insurance to cover up the damages at low costs.In short, it is essential to have an insurance cover to protect against possible damages, but at the same time, being over protective could prove to be counter productive. Whereas, having a high protection level could go a long way towards ensuring that development lasts over time, with proper research regarding every risk being done simultaneously to minimize damages.",

            "reflection": " I began the Risk\nHorizon game with some trepidation. I wasn’t sure what to expect: did not know whether\nI would win or not. In fact, I didn’t win in my first attempt. But, I was\ndetermined not fail. Thus, after several trials I eventually won the Level 4 mark.\nThe game, as elaborated below, taught me (and reinforced) several important\nlessons, including the value of perseverance, diligence, strategic thinking and\ncommitment to communal progress and development.\n\nThe first key lesson I drew from the game was that risk\nmanagement is not easy. It is complex and imbued in uncertainty but with\nperseverance and timely access to resources one can achieve a decent level of\npreparation against human and natural hazards. As a result, one can be able to prevent\nand cope with the various negative challenges that may be thrown at them as\nwell as be able to fruitfully take advantage of opportunities that may emerge. \n\nSecondly, playing the game made me appreciate that perceived\nuncertainty has many dimensions including the difficulties in appreciating: (a)\nthe nature of risk (state uncertainty) – in our case the dynamic nature of the\nrisks (including their likelihood) that comets might visit upon our communities; (b) the\nresponses actors may take in relation to the risk at hand (response\nuncertainty) – e.g., not knowing all the options available to the\nactors/players, what action(s) to (not) take, and their efficacy; and,  (c) the outcomes of the impact of the risks (effect uncertainty) - in our case the severity of the comet “attack”\nand it implications for development (see e.g., Milliken, 1987).\n\nThirdly, although I “intellectually” knew that the key objective\nof the game was to attain progress by managing risk (i.e., by preparing for\nrisk and coping plus taking advantage of opportunities) I found myself\nprimarily preoccupied by the “safety-first” mentality at the risk of not\nrecognizing emerging opportunities that I could have capitalized on to win a\nhigher level of the game. It was only after I got comfortable with the game that\nI began to think more strategically than in my previous attempts. I modified my\nstrategies by focusing on more research, an eye on severity and likelihood of\nthe impacts and speedy responses. Balance was key!\n\nFourthly, I could not believe how engaging the game turned\nout to be even though I knew very well that the game was a simplified version\nof reality and that I was deliberately suspending my disbelief. Kudos to the\ngame designers! In arguably, there are still some areas that could be refined.\nFor instance, I found the game to be too individualistic. For instance, having\nto bear the fate of the whole community by myself felt a bit overwhelming. There\nwere times I felt the need to consult someone in the community on what “we\ncould do” rather than “what I could do”! Moreover, the constraint that I could\nonly undertake one action at a time seemed too tight. For example, why could I\nnot conduct research at the same time also do other things!?  It is\nagainst such a backdrop that the one thing I could add to improve the game\nwould be the addition of some component to the game whereby the player has the\noption to consult members of his/her community rather than being the sole\ndeterminant or decision maker.\n\nIn conclusion, I enjoyed the game\nand highly recommend it.\n\nReference:\n\nMilliken, Frances. 1987. “Three Types of Perceived Uncertainty about\nthe Environment: State, Effect, and Response Uncertainty”.  Academy of Management Review 12(1):\n133-143.",

            "reflection": "I learned early on that\npurchasing the insurance — at least 50% was ideal. In the games that I was able\nto progress quite far, I purchased 75%. This, of course, came at the expense of\ndeveloping my town at a fast speed. Because more money was devoted to protection\nand not growth and development, there was a slower development path. As a\ntradeoff, acquiring more knowledge about impending threats (in this case\nthe meteors) helped decrease the amount of damage my town took. After a few\nmeteors, I learned that the cost of recovering and repairing the town with\ninsurance was less when insurance was previously purchased.\n\nWhen I played the game\nmultiple times, I tested different strategies. In the first few plays, I\npurchased insurance immediately and then devoted remaining resources to\ndevelopment. This worked in that there was immediate coverage for the town,\nhowever in some cases there was not much to protect when the meteors came.\n\nIn later plays, I purchased\ninsurance at a later time, usually as I identified a meteor that could\nsignificantly damage the town. This approach allowed me to build up my village,\nwhile scanning for threats. A challenge of this approach though was ensuring\nthat there was enough funding budgeted for insurance in case a risk appeared.\n\nA third tactic tested\nrevolved around the speed the base community was built and how they were\nupgraded. In some games, I built and upgraded pods in a very systematic\napproach. All pods were built, and then all pods were updated. However this\nbecame less of an ideal approach as I ran out of time each levels. As I played\nmore, I learned better and more efficient patterns on how to build and upgrade\npods in order to maximize revenue. \n\nI think a potential change\nthat would help make the risk management choices more realistic would be to\noffer more specialized forms of insurance. Being able to purchase insurance\nthat is more specialized and resistant to meteors or floods as the situation\ndictates would be a nice – and more challenging – addition. Where I live,\npeople purchase specialized forms of insurance that protects specific events.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "1) In the game risk management as it was taught to us in the\nRisk and Opportunity MOOC has set an acceptable level of risk of comet strike for\nthe world of Alora, and then controlled and sought to mitigate that risk. That\nway the world of Alora could have been protected and has still been able to develop\nirrespective of the various comet strikes. A risk management approach that\nidentifies, assesses, manages and controls potential events may play the role\nof a “guideline” for decision-makers, not only in the simplified word of Alora.\n\nI was overly cautious in avoiding risks and have tended to\nadjust my decisions \"just to be on the safe side.\" Therefore I have spent\ntoo many resources on protection, insurance and research and wasn’t able to reach\nmy goal in time. By increasing the amount of protection and buying insurance I have\nused resources that have been missing when buying development actions. Without\nthese actions the quantity of my incoming resources has stayed on a low level. Doing\nresearch has taken away time I could have spent doing other actions. For that\nreason preparation for risk has affected development negatively both short term\nas well as long term.\n\n2) My emotion has biased my more balanced judgment. If I\nwere to play the game again I would stick to my mitigation strategy as determined\nat the beginning. In addition, I would take more risk in order to have more\ndevelopment.\n\nIt's not possible to avoid all high-risk situations (comet flybys),\nso we need a strategy to handle the risk events (comet strikes) should they occur. Preparation and recovery efforts are important\nfor the persistence of a country or an organization but they also decrease development.\nThe main thing I learned from the game is that it‘s all about balancing. The\nchallenge is to be prepared for all possible risks in a way that allows us to take\nadvantage of development opportunities.\n\n3) In the game the result of my decision is assumed not to\ndepend on the actions of other decision-makers. For example, in real life lots of highly\nupgraded “pods” are not generating resources if there is nobody who wants to\nlife or work in because of a nonexistent protection against comets strikes.

            "reflection": "Risk management in the game was about deciding whether you should try to insure against the inevitability of some damage or try to avoid some damage all together. this decision is helped by researching the risk. by researching I found some risks which seemed certain initially turned out to be nothing major and some others that at first glance were a small chance or of small impact, turned out to be a much higher risk. by doing that research it gives you time to make connections which help with coping with the aftermath. I only played through once, if I were to do it again I would spend less on insurance and more on building up the base. With the research done it provided enough of a benefit that much of the impact was minimised even when disaster did strike. I found that I spent too much on insurance when with better infrastructure I could have avoided more of the losses altogether. I think balance is important though, you can not rely on a single method of risk management. You can not avoid all damage, you can not insure against all losses. you can not plan for every event or outcome. by balancing the three areas you can minimise the exposure to risks. avoiding some risk, insuring the risk that is much more likely to occur and planning with how to cope with the damage afterwards. I learnt that it is very important to research what the risks you face are because without that research you think you have only a small risk so not bother trying to avoid the risk or getting insurance, but also you may perceive something as a large risk and want to buy insurance but then by doing some research you find out that much of that risk is easily avoided so the research has saved you some money.If I was to change one thing about the game it would be to add more options for insurance. Much of the risk avoidance where I live can only be enacted by the government so the main option for the individual is insurance. What risks the people want to protect themselves from and what risks they are willing to accept themselves is an important decision and many do not fully understand what risks they are facing. Once some research is done it would give them a chance to make more meaningful decisions about the risks they face.",

            "reflection": "The\nRisk Horizon game was a very practical application of the intricacies we have\nlearned about risk management over the course of the last two weeks. At first,\nthere was a certain difficulty I faced in being able to handle the multiple activities\non-screen simultaneously against the ticking timer. What’s important is, that\nthis is actually how it should feel while facing risks as it is clearly a\npossibility of loss, an uncertainty. The three main aspects of risk management\nbeing confronting, preparing and coping with the effects were represented by Knowledge\n(Research), Insurance, Protection. When I invested too much into Insurance I\nwas invariably suffering losses but on a smaller scale. The development bar\nkept sliding lower thereby often bringing me back to square one and posing as a\nconstant hindrance to the development. When I focused too much on Research I\nhad to select the comets and I wasn’t able to upgrade my pods, which was again\nfutile from the bigger perspective. For me, what worked was making sure I used\nthe Protection bar right away so as to make sure I was preparing for future\ncontingencies.\n\nAchieving\nlevel 5 in the game was only after repeated efforts and of course, trial and\nerror. At one point I was so engrossed in clearing the level I lost focus about\nmaking sure my choices were sensible or geared towards achieving a balance. Only\nafter playing the game a few times I started upgrading my pods instead of just\ncontinuously planting new ones. At the start of every level I lingered for about\na minute on the protection bar in-between upgrading my pods. This shielded me\nfrom the comets of low-medium severity. I also invested in medium insurance\nbecause I felt that I was spending enough on protection as it is. The moments\nwhen I was waiting for my green bar to fill I would research the comets just as\na back-up measure. I learnt that risk management isn’t just about balancing\npolicies and corrective actions or depending on insurance. If you can\nprioritize and assess the circumstances it’ll go a long way in the process of\nrisk aversion and reduction.\n\nIf\nthere was some addition I could make to the game it would be in the form of\nmore than one type of risk. After a point of time the comets didn’t damage my\npods at all because of my high protection level. Realistically, this can’t always\nbe the case. There are numerous factors that play a role which determine the\nextent to which a risk affects a particular place in spite of the measures\ntaken in advance to prepare for them. The place where I come from, many types\nof risks are not dealt or managed effectively because of ignorance and lack of\npolitical and governmental interferences. The imminent possibility of loss is\nwell-known to people but there is no communal spirit to unite and take\npreventive actions until it is too late.",

            "reflection": "1. In the game, I was all the time facing a trade-off between spending resources (even game money or time) on development and risk management. Meeting development requirement was a condition for advancing in the game, so there was an continuous effort for developing. At the same time, failing to adequately manage risks will definitely lead to a setback in the development.\nThere are some conclusions:\n- You have to know your risks. When a new factor of risk (in our case, comet) appears, you have to spend some time analyzing it. If your protection capacity at the moment are enough for preventing damages, you can concentrate further on development. If not, you have to increase protection, get an insurance and prepare for copping with the consequences (continue researching the risks).\n- Protection agains risks is the key factor. Your have to be prepared, even if building protection will slow down for a while your development. If the level of protection is adequate to the risk level, it will simply negate all the effects of the risk factor. Protection degrades in time, so you have to regularly rebuild it and verify if it is enough.\n- Insurance is a must have in the cases when protection is not enough to face the disaster magnitude. In the cases when protection is enough, and you are in lack of resources (most common cases in real life), insurance can be skipped.\n- In the case of disasters, you have to be prepared to cope with the consequences. This need a good knowledge of the outcomes of the disaster (research, in the case of game). Also, game show us the importance of fact and adequate reaction.\n\nEven in the short terms you have to redirect some resources from developing to the preparation for risk, in the long term losses avoided by a good risk management are higher.\n\n2. Initially I was trying to buy insurance at each level, as soon as I can. In the later games, I have started to buy insurance only when appears some risks that I was unable to prevent at that moment. From the game, I learned the following: You have to be prepared, to know your risks; Is better to prevent a risk, if it is possible, than to cope with it consequences; You have to get insurance for the risk that you can’t prevent; and you must be prepared to cope with the outcomes.\n\n3. In the game, all the risks can be, theoretically, be covered by protection (highest level of protection cover highest damage). In the real life, there can be some risks that can’t be covered. So, in the game can be introduced some (rare) comets with the level of damage higher than maximal level of protection. This will increase importance of insurance and research in the game, and will make it more realistic.",

            "reflection": "Final code: GvgvzSAIn playing the game I was aware of the need\nto find a balance between development (to ensure continuous income and reaching\nthe goals of the green bar on the left), protection (ensuring I raised the land\nto meet the severity of incoming comets), and knowledge (researching only those\ncomets where the severity was very high and I lacked the time to protect myself\nenough). I failed the games on several attempts because I would waste resources\non raising the level of my settlement to a level beyond what was realistically\nneeded – which then impacted on development because of the lack of time left. I\nwould draw on insurance as a last attempt when I realised that a high-severity\ncomet was coming too quickly for me to research and I was ill-prepared. The\ncommunity connections, when a meteor struck proved to be the most crucial factor\nin boosting my protection against damage – it was often these community\nconnections that I relied on to carry me through the crisis. Preparation for\nrisk often hampered development in the short term, but it did ensure steady\ndevelopment over time. It was far better to develop slowly, and prevent any\ndamages, than to develop quickly and spend half the game repairing. Doing\nresearch instead of raising the levels of the settlement was a risk I took,\nbecause the opportunity for increasing the amount of community connections\noften tipped the balance in my favour – resulting in overall protection of the\nsettlement. I’m not sure what I would add to the game to change it. One option\ncould be to ‘evacuate’ in cases where the severity of the meteors was too high\nto cope with. This would, however, cost time and money (resources), and result\nin damages to the settlement. Although it’s not a great option within the\ncontext of the game, in real life it’s often a choice which people SHOULD make,\nbut don’t (because they see the risks as far outweighing the benefits). Another\nfeature, which didn’t come across in the game, was retrofitting existing houses\n– so those houses that are more developed, are better able to withstand shocks\nand risks. In lower-intensity disasters, this can definitely protect the\nhouses. Disasters disproportionately impact on the urban poor – who lack the\nappropriate housing, or are living in areas where building standards are not\nmonitored or enforced. This causes the highest damages in events such as\nearthquakes. Developing buildings and critical infrastructure according to high\nbuilding standards, which are appropriate for the risks in that context, is an\nadded measure that cities and governments can take to protect their\ncommunities. \n\n",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game was an interesting use of animation to educate me on the imperatives of Risk Management.The management of the risk of a meteorite strike averted damages and\nprevented development setbacks. The risk management involves gaining knowledge,\nprotection and insurance thus minimizing the coping after the shock and allows\nthe community to recover quickly. \n\nThe trade-off was to progress to the next level by reaching the required\namount of wealth while at the same time protecting the pods and gaining\nsufficient knowledge and insurance to reduce the coping after the shock.\nAnother trade-off was building of new pods versus the upgrade of existing pods\nsince investing in an existing pod was more expensive. However, it provided\nbetter protection and therefore mitigates the risk of the shock more\neffectively.\n\nPreparation for risk affects development immediately in terms of financing\nto gain insurance, conduct protection measures and to obtain information to reduce\nuncertainty in order to understand the possible outcome of the shock. However,\nthe benefits from risk management for development, only come into affect after\nthe shock occurs which can be very far in the future. That is why investing in\nrisk management in the first place although the risk seems to appear far in the\nfuture may not provide an incentive and impacts decision-making to invest in\nrisk management. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI played the game twice and the second time I concentrated more on gaining\nknowledge and protection rather than building many pods. I realized that\nupgrading the buildings (stronger structure) mitigates the risk more\neffectively than building many pods with a weak foundation, as they are\nvulnerable in case of a shock. \n\nI learned that only the interaction of knowledge, protection and insurance\nmitigated the risk most efficiently. For me, the obstacles were to invest in\nexpensive insurance and protection rather than building more pods in order to\nearn wealth. However, as stated above the investment in protection and\ninsurance paid off over the time. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI would change the time constraint on the investigation of the shock. In my\neyes, the biggest obstacle would be money, which you need to investigate the\nnature of the shock due to utilization of technology and consulting experts. Of\ncourse, a time constraint plays a role as well, however two seconds to investigate\nthe shock doesn´t imply a good risk management but good coordination skills\nwhich is not required to conduct risk management in this game. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "The risk management played a crucial role in the game by helping one \ntake adequate step towards protecting the pods from falling comets. It \nprovided information which enabled game players take adequate measures \nwhere necessary. Information such as severity, chances of impact were \nvery important in taking a decision whether to purchase insurance or \nraise the platform by clicking the button on the bottom left side of the\n game window. During the game two things played important role in my\n choice of protection and insurance, they are information gotten from \nknowledge about comets in terms severity, chances of impact and \nknowledge. Protection of my pods was of topmost priority. At every \nchance, I was always seeking to elevate my platform so that impact from \nthe comets will be minimized on the pods. As I did this, I noticed I had\n a greater chance of surviving and succeeding to the next level of the \ngame.Preparing for risk took some time to pay off. As the moment the\n game begins I started preparing against  possible risk posed by falling\n comets. This was helpful in keeping my pod alive later during the game.Ans to Question 2I\n played the game more than ones. At first, I was just interested in \nbuying new pod and getting as many as I can buy, sometimes obtaining up \nto four before loosing the game. But in subsequent plays I stopped \nbuying more pod and restricted myself to protecting the one, two or \nthree I already have. This helped me stay alive in the course of the \ngame. A take home lesson from the game is \"to be successful one most\n take risk knowledgeably and also take measures in protecting self \nagainst future risks\". Ans to Question 3 I will reduce the \nnumbers of time a pod need to be shielded from the impact of the comet \nfrom 10 to 4 or from 5 to 2. Ones I have assurance that my pod is \ncompletely shielded from impacting comet I will take more steps \ntowards buying more. I will also make it faster to lift the platform in \norder to reduce impact from comet. I notice that the existing game takes some reasonable amount of time to be able to raise the earth platform.Finally I would include a faster option for shielding pod even if it is at a higher cost. This will be of tremendous help.",

            "reflection": "hello everyone i am Aditya Jain , a student from India. So the first question is about how the game is related to risk management. I feel risk horizon,the game, is more about having to face a trade off between gaining knowledge about the risk,protecting yourself from the risk, insuring and developing the city as a whole and also coping against the adversities of the risk in this case the meteors causes to the city. So the trade off i faced was mostly between developing the city and protecting it against the risk caused by the meteors. so the first thing i did was insuring the plot and then start developing aid protecting the city simultaneously. But the major trade off i faced was gaining knowledge about the meteor. Now coming to the next question, yes i did play more then once.Actually,i played 3-4 times before i reached level four.the first time i played the game, i did not even reach the second level because all i did was protect the city and develop it a bit here and there. So the first thing I learnt was the fact that i had to strike a balance between protecting , insuring and developing the city because they all worked hand in hand.Gaining knowledge about the meteor was last on my mind. All i did was click more the meteor and check the severity and forget about the meteor and this was the biggest problem i faced and it costed me a lot at times because i did not know how to prepare myself against the possible adversities caused by the meteors. Now the last question, the one thing i would like to change was the knowledge about the meteors. If there was a possibility of making the severity of the meteors available then it would have helped me to strike a balance between gaining the knowledge about the meteors, insuring ,protecting the city, developing the city and also coping with the adversities caused by the meteors.Thank You.",

            "reflection": "Throughout the course of the game I had to weigh up costs benefits\nof the different methods of risk management. For example, I found there to be a\nsignificant disincentive to invest in both protection and insurance at the same\ntime. On one of my play-throughs, I invested heavily in protection keeping the\nbar near the top, this enabled me to combat the vast majority of comets hits\nwithout receiving any damage by researching them and using the accumulated time\nto build community connections, meaning I had no need to buy insurance for the\nmost part, however, whilst applying this strategy on another play-through I was\nhit by a series of very severe comets near the end of the round and was not\nable to protect against all of them, as my defences were eroded by each comet\nand I did not have time to repair them. Without insurance I lost a lot of\ndevelopment and suffered a large amount of damage, which I was not able to\nrecover from. Like the example given in this week’s video lectures about better\nflood defence making floods less frequent and making residents less likely to\nprepare themselves for floods, I found myself preparing less for damage caused by\ncomets by not buying insurance and keeping less in the way of savings. This\nultimately resulted in a shock that I could not recover from in time. \n\nAdditionally, I found myself trading-off between the formal insurance\noffered by the game and informal insurance. Whilst the game offered a formal\npaid-for policy that pays out in the event of a comet there was also the option\nto delay some development spending and store some money as savings rather than\nspend immediately so that there was some money stored for repairs. In this\nsense there were immediate effects of risk management, in that not purchasing\ninsurance allowed me to immediately invest more money in development (the costs\nof risk management were immediate), but longer term risks from not purchasing\nthe insurance, as the cost of not having insurance if disaster struck was a\nhigher cost of repairing the damage (the benefits of risk management are\nuncertain and usually in the future).  In\nthe end I settled on a combination of the two: some insurance combined with\nsome savings. Overall this shift to a more balanced approach is what changed\nmost about my strategy from play-through to play-through. At first I tried to\ninvest heavily in one method of protection, but found it advantages to adopt a balanced\nmethod using protection, insurance and research roughly equally. \n\nWere I to redesign the game to take account of the situation\nwhere I live, I would take account of the possibility of risk management that\nis not planned properly having negative consequences. For example coastal erosion\nand flooding is a problem where I live and whilst properly planned coastal\ndefences have protected the local population from coastal erosion with limited\nimpact on the surrounding area, poorly planned defence measures have led to increased\nerosion and flooding in areas surrounding the defences, but not protected by\nthem. \n\n",

            "reflection": "ANSWER1the role of risk management can be manefisted in 3 aspects in this game, first, the significance of  aquiring knowledge of risk, if you just bury your head in developing new pods, i guess you can hardly pass one level. second, even if  you  get enough knowledge for the risk, and take some preventative actions, in some cases, loss is still be inevtable. at this time,  you as individual is too vulnerabel to sustain. but you can keep sustaining with the help of  govenment and finance policy or social insurance.   third, after shock, if you can take corrective actions in time, your lost will be minimized and this can enhance your capability of resiliance.  In this game, in\nthe beginning, I only developed a few pods, and when the comets arise, I\nresearch the severity and hit possibility to obtain enough knowledge against the\ncomets. If  the research result indicates\nthat the severity is high, I shall purchase an insurance. If not, I shall\ncontinue to develop new pods. Only when the comets and the resultant flood\ncomes, I shall take the protection. Above all, with different levels of risks,\nthe priority for the knowledge, protect and insurance will be different. in this game, you can see the preparation will imediately affect the  development. if you do not update the pods level, if you do not research the comets, the losses and adverse influence will be much worse. and you failed to sustain to the second level of development. \nANSWER2i think, the major different experiences when playing the game in the first time and the second time lie in, first,  in the second time, i did not take extra actions for the coming of comets with lower severity and lower hit possibility. second, i did not notice the effect of comets falling into the sea since i missed some game instrucions in the first time. in the second time, with the experience, i took protections immediately after the  comets falling down, so some losses was avoided. \n\n 4 things should be kept in mind from this game the most imortantly is that,  when developing the pods, you should keep\nan eye on the possible risk, that is the comet hit. And taking measures on the\nright time will be very important. When risks materialized, time will become a\nrare resource.  You have to fight\nagainst it. Because the more time you grasp and take corrective actions, the\nless the loss will be.below are also some significant points,  first ,in some cases, risk and losses is inevitable, what you can do is to advert the losses. although the difficulty of quantifying the risk severity, the more we learnt from the past shocks, the stronger we shall be when confronting risk. second, it is not easy to balance between the developpment and the following risks. but this does not mean we can bury our head in developing without considering the risk. in this case, if the risk comes true,  the cost of remedies will be much higher than the cost of taking preventative or prevention actions. third, time wil be a treasure in the event of coping afterwards. the more time you grasp, the less the losses will be. however the truth is that, time is always not enough. so we shall do more work in the prevention process to win more time for the coping. \n\n\n\nANSWER3For me, I ONLY passed the 1 first level. One\nmajor reason is that my mouse could not respond enough quickly to correlate all\ndamaged pods in the given time. So I failed to take protection against the coming\nflood. So if I could add something, I SHALL add other tools or resources which\ncan be used to avert the adverse effect. Here in the game, the only resource is\ntime and so it seems to be desperately valuable. \n\n ",

            "reflection": "After\nall the natural and/or unnatural disasters, reading the experiences is most\nimportant and helpful issue. All catastrophes (earthquakes, mining accidents\netc.) gives a sign (for example radon concentrations in groundwater before\nearthquake) before it occurs. It could have a period or not. The game says that\npossibilities may be low or high but it doesn’t change it’s possibility to\n“impossible”.  You may prevent from the\ndisaster and develop your planet but they are not enough if you focus only one\nof them. Also the game shows their roles and importance by the simulated model.\n\n \n\nI\nplayed the game in four modes: only knowledge, only protection, only insurance\nand all three balanced. As the result of four games, I saw that three of the\ntrade offs should use effectively and balanced. If one of them might be missing,\nthe results might be worse. If the knowledge might be missing, the incoming\nbecome less than knowledge-used model. If the money used only for improve the\nknowledge, developing improve faster but regresses very fast if any comet\ncrashes to the planet. It shows that only knowledge is not enough, also\nprotection is needed. But if the money might be used for only protection, the\nplanet could prevent from most of the crashes but it doesn’t help to improve\nthe development level.  It shows that protection\nis not effective itself, it is effective with knowledge. The experience showed\nthat sometimes the good knowledge and protection levels are not enough to\nprevent from all the effects of the disasters. The reconstruction and improving\nthe level of development before the disaster is not a cheap process. But it is\npossible to decrease also this negative effect after a disaster: by insurance\nplans. If you make an insurance plan before the disaster, it could be easier to\nmitigate this costly step. Insurance plans are needed to cover part of the repair\ncosts.  \n\n \n\nI\ncould add not only natural disaster, also unnatural disasters like nuclear\naccidents or air pollution. There might be incentives who build factories\nindependently and I could control also their activities. It might closer to the\nreality beside the natural disasters. For example in my country, in Turkey, the\nnumber of the victims of natural disasters and unnatural accidents in the last\n10 years are almost equal.",

Maybe i would add a tool that could somehow calculate probabilities of frequency and severity in the fall of the meteor, that way the player could handle some variables that would enable it to take more assertive decisions.In the various risks that exist today, we know there are variables that are imponderables such as uncertainty in the case of natural disasters, we also know certain measurable variables such as epidemics and weather variables that are vulnerable to man-. All of them can give at the time, some opportunity to make the most of the circumstances and make risk management a success. I liked the game, it allowed me to realizing that through different scenarios I can have a better risk management and the information and knowledge you may have of the subject are preponderant to perform better manage potential risk and be able to generate and exploit the opportunities it generates .",

            "reflection": "In Risk Horizon players must balance growth with risk\nmanagement and balance components of risk management. Protection was slow but\nhad the greatest benefit for minor comet strikes, sometimes resulting in\nnegligible impact. Knowledge not only helps players to manage risk better\nthrough selecting more appropriate levels of insurance and protection, it also strengthens\ncommunity relationships and the community’s ability to manage risk and cope\nwith negative events. However, it was not always possible to match the level of\ninsurance to the level of risk. Overall, risk management resulted in less rapid\ncommunity growth while also lessening negative impacts and decreasing recovery\ntime which improved long term prospects for growth. Even with risk management,\nif the mix of knowledge, protection and insurance wasn’t balanced, a comet\nstrike could result in significant damage and set back progress in the\ncommunity to the point that the community might not be able to recover within\nthe allotted time. \n\nIn playing the game multiple times I was able to refine a\nstrategy for balancing knowledge, protection and insurance with growth that\nwould work most of the with minor adjustments for each level. However, at times\nit seemed that the order of the comets had as much influence on the outcome as\nthe risk management strategy. When the forecasted risk of a comet differed from\nthe impact, near misses resulted in relief but also regret about other\nactivities that might have been undertaken if the forecast had been more\naccurate. When a comet strike was worse than predicted risk management\nmitigated some of the impact but not as much as would have been possible if the\nforecast had been accurate. \n\nIn a future version of the game I would like to see\nthe ability to work on more than one component of risk management at time,\nperhaps through a scale that would allow the player to select the level of\neffort for knowledge, protection and insurance. In addition, I would like to\nsee the ability to select different levels of insurance for pods and make\nimprovements while making repairs. Repairing structures after a disaster can\npresent opportunities to build back better. I also don’t think that failure at\na level should always result in returning to starting from scratch. Certainly\nfailure to manage risk can result in significant set backs including being\nworse off than before starting but wouldn’t always return you to ground zero.",

            "reflection": "Honestly, this game is truly\ninteresting, especially it provides and simplifies all the knowledge about risk\nmanagement through Luminator legacy model. I think the risk management plays a\nvital role in this game, consists of gaining firstly all the practical\nknowledge that can help and using the tools in game to protect my village,\nsecondly preparing the protection for the situation that the comets hit and\ndestroy legacy through clicking and holding button to raise the village,\nfinally it is a process of confronting the risk and limit damages by purchasing\nthe insurance. \n\n \n\nAdmittedly, in the first time I\nplayed this game, I thought that if the legacy has all its necessary\nprotections as same as the level of severity of comets, when the comet comes,\nmy village would not be destroyed and become more vulnerable either, so I just\nused the protection tool, did not care about the community connection and\ninsurance, and spent money on building pots and develop and upgrade them. And\nthe comets comes to prove that all my speculations were wrong and make me\nunderstand deeply about risk management. Although you have an expensive or\ncareful protection for your treasure, it can not prevent all the shocks when\nthey happen. For example, after my pots were ruined by comets, it costed about\n147$ per one for restoration and rehabilitation, while I just had to pay for\n47$ per one if I bought an insurance packet before. This underestimation made\nme have to face with the risk chain when I did not have enough money and time\nfor my legacy wealth. For the second and third times, I focused on the coordination\ncombined research, protection and insurance, and of course community connection\nto reduce risks from comets as much as possible. Unsurprisingly, the powers of\nthese factors helped me reach level 5 before I have to get out due to\nelectricity outage haha. \n\n \n\nIn fact, I understand that risk\nchain is caused by not only external enviroment, in this case is comets hitting\nthe legacy, but also internal conditions but honestly I did not realized the\nrisk deriving from these reasons in game. If I have chance to develop more this\ngame, I would pose the problems that the pots could be degraded, the community\nconnections could not be managed effectively or so on, this game will become\nmore reality and appealing. For many years, Viet Nam did not have any chances to\nembarke with other countries due to the limited international integration\npolicy of government, and anecdotal evidence shows that the risks come from\nexternal enviroment could be avoided by this policy. But now, I think the\ngovernment and people in Viet Nam have changed little by little to accept the\nrisk from outside to pursue further goals, pursue further opportunities. Before\ndoing that, we have to try to solve and control the risk problems derive from\ninternal environment that are not paid more attention for many years.",

            "reflection": " \n\nRisk management plays an important role in passing levels of\nthis game. The key point here is to balance amount between developing\nfacilities and making insurance. In my way, I usually pay attention to all\nfigures of meteoroids including research, severity, probability of hitting to\nmy facilities and speed. For preparation for risk, I buy insurance for loss and\nprepare budget to cover loss. However, I do not buy insurance immediately when meteoroids\nappear. The time and amount for purchase insurance is different depending on\nspeed of meteoroids, severity and probability of hitting. In my point of view,\nchoosing time buy insurance is very important in order to utilize my budget. Sometimes,\nI must trade off between high severity with low probability hitting and development\nto save amount to upgrade pods. \n\nAt the first time I play this game, although I have read\nalready about guideline, I still do not understand the figures of forecasting\nrisk, buying insurance and how to pass level. Therefore, I do not pass level 1.\nHowever, at second time, I passed level 3 and lost in level 4. I believe that\nmy ability for risk management is better: choosing suitable time to buy\ninsurance, trading off between development and loss and utilizing my budget. The\nmain things I learned from this game: (1) Forecasting loss and time of\ndisaster, (2) We shouldn’t focus on developing community without risk\nmanagement from disaster, (3) preparing all resources including financial factor,\ntechnology for protection and insurance to cover loss when disaster happens and\n(4) allocating budget reasonably for community development and risk management.\n\nBecause it is simple game to manage risk, we should not put\nmany complicated functions in it. It takes a long time. However, if I were game\nmaker, I would give some simple points to improve risk management ability. Some\nmy solutions are:\n\n              + Making more clearly some explanation how to pass\nlevel for game players because I feel a bit confused when playing at the first\ntime\n\n              + The criteria should be given particularly such\nas: number of pods has to be built in level 1, number of pods needs to be\nupgraded in level 2, level 3… Basing on that, the game players will have good\nplan to use budget.\n\n              + Now, the players have to make sense two key\nproblems: risk of disaster and building pot. We can put human factor to game\nfor some reasons. First, the players cannot generate income. All expense is up\nto default budget.  It restricts ability\nof players in creating income and using income. It will bring more interest to\nthe game. Second, if we put this factor to game, it requires players have to\nbalance among three problems: creating income actively, using income suitably\nand reducing loss. Third, we will Improve new standards to pass each level such\nas minimizing number of people died  and cost\nfor insurance, number of people lived after disaster…",

            "reflection": "Risk management serves as the central theme in the\ngame assignment of Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development. The\nrole that risk management plays at core here is balancing of resources:\nproviding enough to sustain a civilization and utilizing enough to protect the\ncivilization from calamities. As such, the key to successful completion of the\ngame requires both solid understanding of how resources are generated and how\nthey can be used to protect against the external risks.  \n\nFirst,\nthe discussion will begin with how resources are generated. Up to ten pods may\nbe built on undeveloped land upon the alien planet, with each pod capable of\nseveral upgrades and each upgrade carrying potential to generate more wealth\nand resources to the civilization. \nStarting with $1,000, the player must be wise on how he/she builds or\nupgrades the pods. While a greater number of pods and/or upgraded pods will\neventually generate a proportional increase in wealth (which, in turn, could be\nused to build even more pods, upgrade them, or spent for protective services)\nand resources, it costs wealth and, more importantly, time to realize the return on these investments. It is also\nimportant to point out here that when wealth and resources are used in this\ncontext, they are related but not the same. While wealth physically allows\nplayers to invest in developing the pods, it is the pure resources, aside from\nwealth, that these pods generate which ultimately decides the progress of the\ngame (as indicated by the shifting color(s) of the right-hand sidebar which\nsignals to players if they are on track to completing the current level).\nFurthermore, developing and/or upgrading pods come at an expense to generating\nresources because the pods cannot provide output while it is upgrading or being\ndeveloped. Therefore, after playing the game several times, I found it more\nbeneficial to start off building and upgrading pods at a calculated and\nconservative rate rather than to go all out spending.\n\nNext,\nthe discussion will continue with the tradeoffs between knowledge, protection,\nand insurance. The tradeoff here is that the player can choose to invest\nheavily in both wealth and pod outputting time to build protection around the\ncivilization and completely prevent casualties from the comets, which often\ndamages pods and thereby damages its outputting capabilities while costing the\nplayer’s wealth to repair, or he/she could research the comet, which\nconcentrates much less wealth and resource but has a tendency to accept damage\nfrom an incoming comet and plant a speedy recovery process that often involves\nminimal to no damage repairs, especially if a solid insurance plan is also\nestablished in place. Either way, the proper preparation for risk must ensure a\ncontinuity of resource output opportunities for the future; and consequently,\non winning the game. \n\nI discovered something\ninteresting regarding the probability of hit and severity of a comet. A comet\nwith high severity but low probability is probably not worth your time. Or is\nit? What if it actually does hit? This is why I used an “expected severity”\nfactor as a decision variable in selecting my protection level. The expected\nseverity factor of a comet can be determined by adding the comet’s probability\nof hit by its level of severity and then dividing the number by two.\n\nFinally, I would\nrecommend revising the damage recovery process of the game. Currently, it is\nbased on a sequence of manual motions that is dependent upon the player’s\npersonal reflexes. I feel that if the game’s intention is to teach risk and\nopportunity, then the process should be automated to represent the real world. ",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game is designed in such a way that force the player to think very deeply in terms of risk and rewards and how to manage risk in a proper way. It further forces the players to apply the knowledge that they gained from the readings (part of this course). I personally found out that insurance can help to a great extent when a damage happens and the cost of repair can be less then estimated. Insurance it itself was forcing me invest more although it is up to the player to manage investment and the risk. The damage could cost extensively expensive without insurance while purchasing insurance helped the investor (me) a lot. While the risk was not completely eliminated, it was actually transferred to the insurer and the risk was now the responsibility of the insurer. It is fair in managing the risk to transfer while not completely eliminating it. The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured (me). Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a the investor (me).Bringing the level up was yet another important aspect of the game. I discovered it very late in the game and it protected me from very severe damages. It was yet another indirect form of insurance the one could use. While i believe that this kind of option may not be that easy in the real life to experience and use once one wants to invest in construction, infrastructure, etc. Another important aspect of the game was knowing the risk actually. One can miss the risk entirely when becoming so busy with the investment scheme or one may know the risk but can't manage it properly. What i learned is to know the risk and management it properly through insurance or transferring risk to the insurer, leveraging it, manage it or eliminate it through different risk management strategies. Overall the game was very useful to know the concept of risk management further and apply it in the real life example. I personally found it very useful. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk\nmanagement in this game is to increase and apply the knowledge, protection and\ninsurance tools in order to manage my Luminator of Alora in term of balance\nrisk preparation and healthy development. Because of those Comets careen into\nthe water and cause waves that hinder development, I might to balance between\ngrowing my community and preparing for those potential shocks. That’s the reason\nwhy I have to consider to use three Luminator powers: Research, Protection and\nInsurance. I would rather to buy a strong scheme of insurance than pay\nattention to grow Luminator too fast or focus on expanding my community. Besides,\nthe more I accumulate research the more I can protect my community avoid the\ncomet hits. As for me, we do not know what will happen in the future so we must\ndo our best in present and make it better in near future.\n\nIf I play the game again\nin second time I would take more time to research and buy a higher insurance\npackage. Insurance may be a mystery to many people. People trade off the\naffordable cost of insurance for the peace of mind that a large loss won’t mean\nfinancial ruin. That makes you feel comfortable to growing your own task in\nthis game. Everyone knows what risk is in this game, we spend money to build\nour community and we take the risk regularly when the comet hit, whether we\nrealize it or not. The more I play the more I realize that in every decision I\nmake, I assessing the pros and cons, that the main thing I learn from this game\n– do a risk assessment in risk management. The challenge is to make it more\nconscious when it happens again.\n\nThe benefits of risk\nmanagement in the game captures are huge. You can save a lot of money if you\ndeal with some comet hit in a proactive manner. The result will be that you\nminimize the impact of damage and seize the opportunities that occur. This\nallows you to build your community on time, on budget and with the quality\nresults your plan. But if I am in task with developing a new version of game, I\nwould build another risk event besides comets hit risk. In that case you have\nto face more risk. So you need to prioritize risk. Some risks have a higher\nimpact than others. Therefore you better spend your time on the risks that can\ncause the biggest loss and gain.\n\nIn my city, I think we may\nset priorities and reviewing and revising risks in terms of changing\nenvironment. Understanding the nature of a risk is a precondition for a good\nresponse. Therefore take some time to have a closer look at individual risks\nand don't jump to conclusions without knowing what a risk is about.\n\nRisk analysis occurs at\ndifferent levels so you need to set priorities and reviewing them frequently.\nLooking at the effects, I can describe what effects take place immediately\nafter a risk occurs and what effects happen as a result of the primary effects\nor because time elapses. A more detailed analysis may show the order of\nmagnitude effect in a certain effect category like costs, leading time or\nimproving quality of life. Another angle to look at risks, is to focus on the\nevents that precede a risk occurrence, the risk causes. List the different\ncauses and the circumstances that decrease or increase the likelihood.\n\n \n\n ",

            "reflection": "1: There is high risk of flood in\nthe community. The community itself is close to the river and high chances of\nimpact to the people if severity of flood it high. However there is an\nopportunity to make different choices to protect the community. I made choices seeing\nthe severity of the hazards and its impact. If severity is high then I tried to\nprotect community, more investment on development. Similarly, analyze the situation\nproperly that how much investment I have to make to protect people and development\nwork so that there will be minimum impact of disaster. If there are low fund\nand severity of hazard is high then I buy insurance with proper analyses\nwhether it will pay back later or not. If the impact of hazard is not that\nstrong and sufficient protection measures, the continue development work\nwithout extra efforts. The proper risk management averts damages and prevents\ndevelopment setbacks and understanding the environment in which risks and\nopportunities arise is one of crucial factor on risk management. This has provided\nopportunity for me to develop the plan and help out to make quick and right\ndecision. Through this process, I was able to reach level 5.\n\n2: I played game twice. When I\nplayed first time, try to see the impact of hazard and focus on protecting\ncommunity and investment on development without proper analyses of the cost\nbenefits. Available funding, community network and insurance was completely\nignored or not realized. When I played second time, then I was able to analyze\nthe different perspective on risk management. I was aware of the insurance\npolicy and did thhe proper cost benefit analysis in addition to community\nnetworking and support system. I realized that how Insurance can help to\nprotect adverse shocks. Similarly, the community support each other during\ndisaster and made sure that how they can play effective role to minimize the\nimpact of disaster. I have learnt through the game that if we are better\nprepare for possible disaster threat, in this case flood, we can easily manage\nthe risk. Risk management cannot be done in isolation, there is need to have\nproper preparedness through protection measures, establish the community\ncoherence, cost benefit analysis either through insurance or intact risk factor\ninto development process. Similarly, we need to identify the obstacles of risk management\nand ways to overcome those risk. When there is good preparation for risk management,\nthen there will less adverse effect or impact and coping can be minimal which\nlead to quick recovery with less investment. Lastly, I have noted that risk\nmanagement is cost-effective but not always feasible. It depends on the context\nand capacity/interest of the community, stakeholders, state and international\ncommunity\n\nIn a nutshell, I have learnt that\nhow knowledge, protection and insurance can provide complementary means of\nmanaging risk. It has provided wider perspective on risk management with visual\nand help out to grasp the concept very clearly compare to reading the report\nand article. \n\n3: In case of Nepal, there is low\nlevel of awareness on the importance of risk management and limited capacity to\ndealt with risk either disaster due to hazards or climate induce, economic\ncrises, civil unrest. Almost half of the population lives under the poverty\nline and faces daily survival. In this case, living with risk is normal phenomenon.\nIn this context, I will add the components on awareness raising, capacity\nbuilding, risk assessment and prioritization of those risk with proper guidance\nsteps. Apart from it I will add the clear steps in tutorial course with example.\n\n",

The lesson I learned I should prove resource into many duties: research to get knowledge, buy insurance and protection in the same time.2) When play it again, I felt more confident to buy 2nd insurance level to decrease the damage. I must research the severity of risk and spend the reasonable cost to buy Insurance to re-built the community and city. However, we should understand and equip knowledge of risk to protect in time, when to use the bar to increase the city higher than ocean water level, observe and research the impact of change, hitting from comet movement to provide the reasonable policy. If play over once more time, we must forecast comet movement and press and hold the slider in right position,  the time until impact, and the severity of the comet. But actually, I don't still know how to create community connections right before the comet hits, if get more time and I will study again.  the \nmain things I learned from the game that I will forecast in advance many risk situations for any things, I will write down and think the way how to manage risks, preparation to cope with it, research the important information, build protection methods, and buy insurance to protect...  \t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \t3) If I can develop the new version of the game:3.1) Knowledge: I will provide the payer more knowledge of this game. such us: explain the comet hitting 's impact distance, which safety distance we should move the island higher, which level insurance is possible in each case or give more choosing about re-building the island (grow tree/food, build house... ). 3.2) Picture: I will draw more waves and pictures from the comet hitting, damaged picture more lively 3.3) Insurance: give more chooses, how many USD for buying insurance for food, house, clothes, car, unemployment insurance3.4) Protection: for the player to choose: shelter, food, clothes, the organization...3.5) Example: It is better, we show an example game and outcome from this game for the payer really master it. 3.6) For my living place: Vietnam has got a lot of traffic accidents, therefore I will design a traffic game 's risk management.- Knowledge: make some questions to evaluate the knowledge, which ages should study traffic safety, small children, adult, man, woman, old generation..., which one is best?- Mean: which kind of mean should be allowed to use in the rural, urban, large city, town.. such as: car, canoes, cycle, vehicle, helicopter, train, bus, taxi...- Construction: which necessary meters should be required when building the land? The lands should be designed to use within in the future time, at least 50 years' demand.- Insurance: give more some kinds of insurance we should to buy to cover the damage. For example: insurance for shelter, food, clothes, car, houses, office building, water, essential things, unemployment insurance.- Protection: when joining traffic, which kind of protected things we should bring or buy such as safety belt, hat, shoes, clothes..- Traffic situation: make more traffic games for player to join and show the outcome or loss/ damage picture if they made a wrong or unsuitable traffic joining.

            "reflection": "  In the game the role of risk management is defined as\npreparing before shocks and coping afterwards. This is underpinned by\nknowledge, protection, and insurance. In my first few attempts I made a strategic\nchoice to build the community but at the same time did not compromise on\nbuilding knowledge of the comets.\n\n \n\nHowever it was over the next set of attempts that I began to\nbuild Alora with the combined use of the above mentioned tools.  By clicking on the comet I built up my\nresearch bank, which helped me put up protection measure. This enhanced the\noutcomes e.g. minimise damage to Alora and help it flourish. However as this\nprotection was not a total guarantee I began to incorporate insurance to help cushion\nthe blow from adverse shocks.  \n\n \n\nSo at stage two and three I began to understand how to look\nfor the severity of the comet and the chances of it hitting my pods. To\nminimise the chance of a hit I ensured that my protection bar was fully aligned\nwith the severity of the comet. However sometimes it was too late to buy\ninsurance as the comet had already appeared and in other cases when insurance\ncover was available I did not have enough resources.  \n\n \n\nWhilst in literature terms and understanding I was full ware\nof the need to proactively deploy all the elements of effective risk\nmanagement, on the game it took me a while to find the right combination and\nreach level five. After a few hours of continuous playing I decided to approach\nfrom risk mitigating perspective which most insurance companies deploy when\ninsuring against natural disasters. With this in mind I made one final attempt\nwith a revised strategy, raise Alora high enough to mitigate effect of comets\nstrike, develop pods evenly over a period of time and take out both sufficient\ninsurance and research when the risk of being hit by a comet was high and Alora\nwas not appropriately raised.\n\nSo on reflection the game is very intuitive and a must tool\nto help understand how it can use be used in everyday lives/situations. It\nshows many concepts about finding the right balance/strategies to help make\neffective and tough decisions under budget, time and natural disaster environment.\nTo put this into my perspective I did a cost benefit analysis when I was faced\nwith underpinning my house as a result of subsidence or move all together to a\nsubsidence free area. By moving I would pay cheaper insurance premium but face\nfuture potential risk of subsidence including impact and shock in an area\ndensely populated with evergreen trees and known for heavy subsidence. This\nwould financially impact me more than rectifying my existing house as per\ninsurance instructions/research and thereby keeping the insurance premium down\nto a minimum. \n\n \n\nIn this context the one change I would introduce to the game\nwould the probability of subsidence occurring and the levels of it ranging on a\nscale of 1 to 10  with 10 being the\ngreatest and quickest for subsidence to occur. With this information people in\nmy area would be able to make appropriate risk management choices within the\noverall risk chain.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The game “Risk Horizon” is a real time strategy game, which shows how and why risk management is important for healthy development. Almost all actions in the game cost wealth. In other words, the key to win the game lies in the distribution of your wealth,because the amount of money is limited.Risk management contains both the preparation and the ways to cope with the potential loss. However, this game focuses more on the preparation.Each round only has 3 minutes. In the game, you are the owner of the land and should decide how to balance the arrangement of the money. To beat the level, you must reach the line indicated on the development meter, which means to fill the meter buy building and upgrading the pods. On the other hand, the comets threaten would destroy the pods and push the meter back to red, which require the gamer put some money to research the comets or build up the bar. Both of them are necessary, because the former means to use money to catch the opportunity for development while the latter means to get protection.When first played the game, I mostly choose to develop and update the pods, for the more pods I develop, the faster the meter could turn into green. Therefore, developing and updating pods cost a lot of money, which are at the expense of better preparation for the comets threaten. During the second time, I tried to combine the two together. In the first round, you should buy the highest price insurance, for it would cover part of the repair costs. Then, building two or three pods and updating them. In this round, the comets threaten would not be very severe, so the bar just need to light up in the second level and keep observing the comets is enough. In the second, you should build and update at least two more pods, together with higher cost insurance. In this round, the comets threaten become severer, the bar need to reach at least forth level. When a comet hits, the last chance to protect the pods is to make community connections. The time limits of the connection depends on the time you spend on researching the comets, so you should pay attention on the research of the comets. The third and the final rounds, you should shift the focus from the development of the pods to the update of the pods. As the number of pods has increased, you should update the pod not only to strengthen the ability to prevent the comets threaten.From this game, I learn risk management is the essential way to prevent the potential loss. The most useful preparing strategy of risk management is planning. Planning included finding Stop-Loss and Take-Profit points. Both of them mean to analysis the predictable situations that may cause some loss or profits. Before any investment, you need to calculate the probability of gain and the probability of loss, which helps to give us a rational way to compare and select the most profitable one to avoid the risk and achieve success as far as possible.I think this game is like another game I have ever played before, Red Alert. In Red Alert, you also need to use the limited money to build a country and enhance the armed forces to prevent the attack from your enemy. I prefer to play the Red Alert. I think the game “Risk Horizon”can add more elements, for example, more disasters like earthquake or rainstorm. The game interface can be more realistic. ",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game prompted me\nto address the theory of risk management in a setting whereby both short-term\nand long-term implications could be experienced.  The game effectively demonstrates the\nchallenge of balancing protection and insurance against development and how\nseemingly wise short-term decisions can negatively affect long-term growth.   I\nplayed the game several times and my technique changed with each game play.  \n\nTo begin with, I adopted a\ncautious approach, prioritising protection and insurance over growth.  Although this secured the community in the\nshort-term, it did not encourage growth or development and consequently did not\nallow me to progress in the game.  I\nchanged my focus from the protection of my pods (raising the land to secure\nagainst the effects of a comet collision) and insurance (securing my pods so\nthat in the event of a comet collision, I would be partially covered against\nany damage) to invest in development and improve research and knowledge-sharing\n(through understanding the comets and their potential impact); this allowed my\npods to grow at a more sustainable and secure rate.  However, despite developing my pods at this\nsteady rate and obtaining lower-level insurance to protect them, several ‘shocks’  (the comets) very quickly destroyed what had\ntaken a long time to develop.  I could\nafford to repair the pods following the first shock, but had few resources left\nto address the subsequent shocks and their effects, whilst continuing the level\nof growth.\n\nThe main learning outcome, for\nme, was that a cautious approach, whereby protection methods are prioritised over those of\ndevelopment, does not always provide long-term benefits as the rate of\ndevelopment is too slow and does not encourage growth or opportunity.  Combined with a lack of resources (for\nexample, where there are not enough ‘pods’ to generate income), options became\nlimited and it becomes more difficult to maintain and provide adequate protection\nfor the structures in place. \nFurthermore, research can help to negate the effects that a shock has on\na community, by enabling greater preparation and communication between\nactors.  Whilst (mainly financial) resources\ndo help in the implementation of risk management, cheaper aspects such as\nresearch can be just as important in addressing potential shocks.\n\nIf I were to change anything in\nthe game, it would be to add further types of risk to the equation.  By including families in the pods, and\nthereby establishing a community, the game could address a variety of risks including food shortages,\nfinancial crises, drought, crime, unemployment and disease.  Many risks are intertwined with others and it\nwould be useful to examine the complex natures of these, as presented in the game format.",

            "reflection": "The game was a great way to apply the knowledge of risk management. My approach towards the game was based around the strategy of comprehensive development with protection and constant updates about the risk of comets  for the long term. While for the short term, there were many instances when I had to make a trade off from my long term goal. I had opted for insurance instead of protection when a comet with high magnitude was about to hit. This helped me to utilize more effectively the resources and save time as I didn't have to concentrate on protection activity but focus on development. The insurance package that I would opt depended on 2 factors - the level of protection I already had and the magnitude of the risk faced by Almora. Insurance also aided to disperse the risk over large number of people and minimize the effect on me. During situations when the the severity of the comet was slightly above Almora's protection level (say less than 3 points), I didn't opt for insurance. Instead I utilized that money to increase the protection level and also invest in development activity. I even gained greater knowledge about the comet in this situation, so as to get more time to communicate with the local population.In the entire game, it became extremely evident that preparing for the risk through knowledge, insurance and protection substantially reduced (or even nullified) the losses. I was able to focus more on development activities as the fear of loosing substantial resources were reduced. Protection measures proved to be extremely helpful in minimizing the losses from the waves and the comets. It certainly proved the adage \"a stitch in time saves nine\"When I first played the game, I laid a greater emphasis on knowing the possibility and severity of the comets and protecting Almora from it, that is, I was more focused on knowledge  protection rather than development activities. I then realized that is also very important to induce coping mechanism as well as to distribute the losses through insurance. Hence, when I played the game again, a greater emphasis was laid on development and also on the need for insurance when the looming risk was pretty high. I also traded with the amount of time spent on acquiring knowledge by spreading it across preparing for it and developing the region.If I were to be in the team for the development of the new version of the game, I would certainly include the most important dimension of risk management which according to me is neglected in this game - the risk of operational human error. In the entire game, whatever strategic decisions we had to take were implemented seamlessly. However we are all very well aware that this does not happen in the real world. Actions are extremely prone to shortcomings compared to the plans because of human involvement. The risk of implementation is the greatest risk and needs to effectively captured in the next version of the game.",

            "reflection": "Reflections from the Risk Horizon gameWhat was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?It was awesome that the preparation of risk significantly increased the likelihood of advancing levels. It was a good lesson that take knowledge of meteorites (the biggest threat in the game) had to be in a balanced manner.If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I had to play several times to understand the importance of being balanced in the three most important aspects: preparation, development and contingency. The first attempt I’ve not considered all the threats and I barely accomplished the first level.Lessons learned is that, beyond having a good economic development, it should be better prepared for threats or for any inconvenience, everything is made ​​in vain.The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?To make the game able to take aspects of the reality in which we live, the limitations should be given the difficulties to take cognizance of the threats. In the game the only cost of learning was not be able perform other tasks, when in reality we know that learning has a cost that the game is not represented in the best way.ConclusionProfit, grow economically, develop new technologies, to open markets or have a big city are useless if that development is not accompanied by good risk management, to take cognizance of the threats and treat them properly. Obtaining insurance can minimize the damage but much better is to have contingencies developed based on knowledge of the threats.",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a key role in the game. The game basically dealt with the planet of Alora and how it could be protected against comets which was the main threat.  In the game making the choice within what's to be done further was the most difficult one as it involved trade-offs which were serious. But as it is said, you have to sacrifice something that you want for something that you want more, I too had to make choices. The protection, knowledge i.e research and insurance were the key choices which were to looked upon in order to mention overall development. I as the Illuminator of the planet tried to first go for protection in few initial seconds. Then as I would see the comet approaching I would do the research and based on the severity increase the research and otherwise would make and update pods. Also based on the severity and chance of hit of the comets, I would take the insurance which would help in reducing repair costs. Preparation for risk would affect development in the sense that if one would use protection, development would stop thus affecting it immediately, insurance and making of pods would exhaust the resources and affected development in a while.I played the game more than once. Initially I was just trying to analyze what and how it is to be done and how can the planet be saved from its main shock hazards. In the first time I just focused on developing the pods without paying much attention to protection and without this the planet would become more prone to comets and thus underdeveloped. Thus the next time when I played I tried to balance it out by using protection towards the start so that it could be saved from comet attacks. Also I made sure that more focus was given to research as well as it would help cut the damage if the comet was hit. The main things that i learnt in the game were that just as in real life we require to manage risks effectively by dealing with these key elements how we can apply in this virtual world and its applicability in the real one.I would like to make a change in this risk horizon game. Although everything is presented simply and in a good format but yet the aspect of the mini game of making community connections to lessen the damage just didn't go well with it. This just seemed really unrealistic in accordance with the risk and there was no way available to be able to prevent or minimize the loss or damage. I would rather propose a very simple change of removing this game and just giving option of rehabilitation, recovery, by exhausting resources. So if one would have good amount of resources, he would be in a good condition and would be able to minimize losses whereas it would be unfavorable for a person with lesser resources. In the place I live, synonymously too this option is applicable that how at the time of hazard, the people are treated, rehabilitated etc to recover from it.",

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk management in the game was to give players\nthe opportunity to choose which risk management strategy to invest in, in the\nevent of meteor strikes causing destruction of the pods and financial loss. I\nwould begin to build pods, insure at a rate of 75% because in the long run,\nthis would save me a lot of money and that meteor strike was imminent. I based\nthat decision on the fact that I could never be sure that any other risk\nmanagement strategy would work and result in 0% damages so for me, insurance\nwas the best solution that I could take, knowing that community connections was\nnot 100% guaranteed to save my community.\n\nAside from that, I also made sure that during development, I\nwould constantly raise the platform to prevent flooding. I found this to be\neffective especially just before the meteor disappears into the horizon.\nResearch of meteors seems to be effective to decrease severity of the damage\nbut I managed to go quite far without having to invest much in research.\n\n2. I played the game several times, because I wanted to\nimplement different strategies. My first strategy was to simply go as far in\nthe game as I could based on features of the game itself. I managed to go\npretty far by playing based on investing a lot on risk management. In the next\nfew games I played, I tried taking a lot of risks. I realize that when I would\ndo this, I could save a lot more money by not investing in insurance and\ncontinuously developing the pods but I would eventually run out of resources\nwhen a meteor causes damages and I am trying to rebuild.\n\nI think the game brings out very important issues of risk\nmanagement if one makes the links; I felt very much like a decision-maker,\naware of the resources available, knowing the options I have and doing what I\nfelt was best. The difference however, is that in real-life, there is a\nmisperception very commonplace in governments; that disasters are imminent and\nour job is to respond when much emphasis and investment should in fact be\nplaced on preparedness.\n\n3. I would include a contingency credit mechanism that would\nallow me more funds to rebuild and to payback little by little after the\ndestruction.",

            "reflection": "The game taught me the importance of using the available resources at the adequate circunstance. It was clear that the three tools had different results as we evolved in the game. First of all, I noticed the importance of insurance. In an initial phase of the investment it is really important to garantee that the return will be safe and will not be threatened by high damages. Besides that, my main strategy in level 1 was to build as much pods as I could.In level 2, I gave priority to insurance as well and then I tried to improve my pods keeping them all at the same level, instead of improving only one. Protection did not seemed to be that important until this stage.Regarding level 3, I manage to improve my pods and kept them, once again, at the same level.I believe I’ve lost the game at the forth level because I did not use enought protection. Firstly, the damages for each individual shock increased substancially. Secondly, the repairment of the pods was too slow for the number of occurences. As a result I was still finishing the recovery from one shock when the next one occured. Besides that, the insurance seemed to be less efective in this stage, in which I used little protection. There might be a correlation between these two factors.As for the information about the comets, it did not seemed that relevant to me. That is also a possible reason for me to have lost at level 4.",

            "reflection": "Risk management helped players to evaluate the opportunity\nto invest in the city while learning how to protect it from outside factors\nusing mitigation strategies (elevating the city) and insurance. Information played a pivotal role in this game because one could learn\nif he or she had enough technology or mitigation strategies in place to protect\nthe city. For my risk and opportunity approach, I decided to build houses and use mitigation strategies at first. I bought\ninsurance when my research (the information presented on meteorites) informed\nme that the probability of a shock was likely to happen and that my mitigation\nwas not enough to protect the capital invested in the city. Clearly, I did not\nhave enough capital and time to do everything at once: build capacity, research\nabout the risk (meteorites), invest in mitigation, buy insurance, and cope with the shock. For\nexample, if I used a lot of my time and resources to research about each meteorite,\nI would not build the capital in the city. Similarly, if I used all my resources to mitigate and elevate the city (protection), I would not have sufficient money to develop it to\nacceptable standards. The trade-off is, therefore, key to successful outcomes\nin the game and in real life itself. One needs to decide what strategy gives the best utility.\nHaving the knowledge to make certain decisions and understand the short and long-term\nimpact of mitigation and coping strategies is of paramount importance to effective, sustainable development. \n\nFortunately, I had the opportunity to play the game more\nthan once and realize how to better use my time and resources in order to take\nadvantage of the opportunity and protect the city from imminent hazards.  I started to think about the relationship\nbetween time and availability of resources – sometimes I had time left to use\nthe capital to invest in the city, but I did not have sufficient funds to do so\n– as well as the importance of research for smart decision making and\nmanagement: It was not worthy to invest a lot of money to protect the city if I\nwas not allocating enough capital to build and develop the place. In fact, the more mitigation I used, the more expensive it became over time. \n\nIn regards to developing a new game, I would also create a\nset of mitigation strategies with different costs and level of effectiveness.\nSometimes, ordinary citizens and governments have different opinions on how to\nmitigate and cope with risks.  They need\nto choose what mitigation or coping strategies they will use, if any at all. In bureaucratic environments, choosing what strategy to use is even more complicated. Hence, if people were able to choose which\nstrategies they would like to use at a specific time to protect the city (e.g. elevating\nthe city or building a wall), that would make the game even more realistic in\nmy point of view. ",

            "reflection": "I did this game for several\ntimes. Before I finished my second week study, I started this game for the\nfirst time. According what I learned from the first week, I knew \"risk\nmanagement\" is important when disaster comes. I think I can finish at\nleast one level. But the result turned out to be I failed\nunexpectedly.\nSo I started to watch the videos and read the martial. Finally,\nI passed the second level. Even it is the extraordinary score, I have\ntried my best. What I have gained from this game are as following: \n1.knowledge is important.\nEnglish is not my first language, so it is difficult for me to understand the\ninstruction of this game. Such as, people should make effort to get the\nknowledge about the \"risk management\". Nobody get this kind\nof knowledge by birth. Energy and resources should put into this kind\nof learning.\nAfter I failed the second time, I started to re-read the instruction carefully\nand tried my best to understand every sentence, not the \"main\nidea\". After the reading, I found I hadn't understand how to\n\"protect the community\" before I started play the game which is one\nof the main reason leading to my failure.\nThat is the example about that even people knows the importance of the “risk\nmanagement”, but still fails to implement. According to my experience, the cost\nof learning the instruction is necessary, and the benefit from the\nlearning is much larger than the damage I suffered from the game. But I will\nnever realize it before I failed two times. \n2. Banlace is the main point of game\nfrom this game, I think \"management\" is the thing about \"balance\".\nIn order to survive in this game, people should balance time and\nresources, building and protection, researching and insurance.\nIn the first level, I didn't feel money is limited. I can do what I want with\nenough money. So what I did is to buy the insurance first, because I know\nclearly some risk I can't avoid. My researching and protection are not enough\nat the beginning. I have to choose take the risk. The \"insurance\" is\nthe main factor to relieve of the damage and recover as soon as possible.\nIn the second level, money becomes limited. I have to make choice when I should\nbuy the insurance, when I must increase the protection, when I need upgrade my\npods. At that time, money always is shortage, I have to wait for the money\nincreasing to the lowest limitation, but comets were never waiting for\nme. I can't imagine how other people can make it under this condition.\nIn every level, time is always limited. What impressed me most is I\ncan't do research and upgrade pods at the same time.\nI did enjoy when I saw \"no damage\" appear after a comet hit\nthe ground. But I still feel helpless. When I did research, and found the severity\nis higher than my protection. But there no enough time to let me decrease the\nseverity or increase the protection before the comet hit the ground.\nIt is a pity that I cannot finish the fourth game. I cannot imagine how\ndifficult it will be on the forth level. May it be possible, that the game\nbecome easier, because all the jobs did in the precious level make a virtuous\ncycle in this game?\nI still have a question about this game. After comet hit and the damage came\nout, I would have some time to arrange the coverage of the insurance. There\nwill be several yellow balls on the screen. I don't know how to move it to my\npods. Does it appear randomly?\n\n",

            "reflection": "Role of risk management in the gameThe role of risk management prior to completing this activity appeared to seem an easy balance.  With the theories that have already been presented, it was hard to imagine why for example certain countries such as India could not move forward and implement recommendations.When  I played the game, I then understood that risk management involves a balance between becoming knowledgeable, having the appropriate resources amongst established communities, research strategies and using insurance to help alleviate or cushion shocks which would happen from time to time.As I moved forward in the game, I realised that community involvement along with further development assisted other \"pods\" when damaged.  The insurance taken alleviated much of the payment towards damages.  Through constant development of my \"pods\" I was able to minimize risk although it was expensive to do.  There were even times, I too, thought the asteroid would not hit based on my own behavioural bias'.  I often risked further development and relied heavily on insurance.  It was inevitable at least one of my \"Pods\" would be damaged.  The question regarding the amount of money needed to fix my \"Pod\" was more of a concern.  I also saw that the other developed \"Pods\" I had established provided support to the other damaged, under developed communities, thus damages were minimal based on cost-benefit analysis.I was lucky enough to only play the game once reaching the desired Level.  Quite honestly, it was very stressful, managing funds, ensuring communities were developed, forecasting the likelihood of a disaster and purchasing insurance.  What I have learned during this activity is that the key to overcoming obstacles (shocks), is ensuring that information is available to all concerned, provide adequate resources,  be realistic with design and implementations, and build foundations through policy development  that are constantly being revised over time as changes need to be made based on circumstances.If I were to develop a second edition to this game, I would ensure the instructions provided further clarity.  In addition, I would like to illustrate further how \"pods\" helped other under-developed communities.  I would change the meteor concept and perhaps have individuals on an island stranded and they would be required to learn how to live off the land.  Through a first initial shock, one would become knowledgeable in understanding the shock, determining the probability and establishing appropriate measures to alleviate/cope during future shocks.  In short, risk management in my community is important to me.  It is about community connections, helping each other to survive in times of need/disaster and sustaining these connections. These ongoing connections have proven to be valuable throughout the years.",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection: \n\nIn the course of playing the game\nI learned a few things about risk management:\n\nThe planet Alora is one that is\nprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one that\ncan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen the\nimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect the\nplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:\nDue to limited resources like time and money. We had to make various decisions\nthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming comets\nwere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the comet’s\nseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as research\ntime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take action\nto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,\nit can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level of\nprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect the\nplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance and\ndevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching a\nhigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In the\nbeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and using\nthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase in\nfinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way that\nit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance and\nprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actually\nlessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances of\nhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet through\nobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according to\nthe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not cause\ntoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protect\nAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role in\nreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one has\nto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower the\ncosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on the\nphysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutive\ntime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better that\nis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I would\npropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to the\ncontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relatively\nfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given this\nsituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions with\nlimited and slower growing financial resources.\n\n",

We had to make various decisions\nthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming comets\nwere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the comet’s\nseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as research\ntime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take action\nto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,\nit can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level of\nprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect the\nplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance and\ndevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching a\nhigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In the\nbeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and using\nthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase in\nfinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way that\nit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance and\nprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actually\nlessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances of\nhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet through\nobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according to\nthe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not cause\ntoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protect\nAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role in\nreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one has\nto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower the\ncosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on the\nphysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutive\ntime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better that\nis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I would\npropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to the\ncontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relatively\nfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given this\nsituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions with\nlimited and slower growing financial resources.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Reflections about the GameRisk management plays a crucial role in this game. It was in fact it was a challenging experience to learn how risk management is important for one’s healthy development through this game. The tutorial given for assistance helped to learn about the game more in deep. Being the luminator of Alora, my task of developing this community by meeting certain milestones in the ways was really hard and thought provoking.Before considering ever building the pods we certainly need to ensure adequate measures like sufficient amount of cash is there with us. It was necessary throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time available to make sure this risk protection was limited.Alora falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.The power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage.Playing the game for the first time you will certainly find it difficult to access the amount of risk involved and possible consequences of it you may have to face if hit by the unforeseen factors, But given a chance to play again you will certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damage based on previous experiences.Main things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different ways to manage risk etc.If given a chance to develop a new version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups within the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each members with the group financially in times of need. They could also take up a group insurance policy to anticipate and manage their risk. They could discuss within the groups their past experiences of risk and share within their group.The effective management of risks and opportunities is increasingly seen as an important competitive differentiation, helping organisations achieve success despite difficult economic times.We establish a strategy for managing risks and opportunities that is integrated throughout the operating model of your organisation.I understand that any approach is only as good as the people that deliver it. Our specialists have extensive experience across a range of capital programmers, projects and organisations worldwide which when coupled with intelligent and practical tools enable us to offer bespoke solutions tailored to your specific needs. It describes what a strong risk management strategy looks like and explains what the main components of risk management are. It describes the common obstacles that often impair risk management and ways to identify, prioritize, and address these obstacles. What factors affect how risks evolve?Which are the common obstacles to risk management?Which are the policy priorities and institutional solutions that can help overcome obstacles to risk management?",

            "reflection": "Reflections about the GameRisk management plays a crucial role in this game. It was in fact it was a challenging experience to learn how risk management is important for one’s healthy development through this game. The tutorial given for assistance helped to learn about the game more in deep. Being the luminator of Alora, my task of developing this community by meeting certain milestones in the ways was really hard and thought provoking.Before considering ever building the pods we certainly need to ensure adequate measures like sufficient amount of cash is there with us. It was necessary throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time available to make sure this risk protection was limited.Alora falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.The power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage.Playing the game for the first time you will certainly find it difficult to access the amount of risk involved and possible consequences of it you may have to face if hit by the unforeseen factors, But given a chance to play again you will certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damage based on previous experiences.Main things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different ways to manage risk etc.If given a chance to develop a new version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups within the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each members with the group financially in times of need. They could also take up a group insurance policy to anticipate and manage their risk. They could discuss within the groups their past experiences of risk and share within their group.The effective management of risks and opportunities is increasingly seen as an important competitive differentiation, helping organisations achieve success despite difficult economic times.We establish a strategy for managing risks and opportunities that is integrated throughout the operating model of your organisation.I understand that any approach is only as good as the people that deliver it. Our specialists have extensive experience across a range of capital programmers, projects and organisations worldwide which when coupled with intelligent and practical tools enable us to offer bespoke solutions tailored to your specific needs. It describes what a strong risk management strategy looks like and explains what the main components of risk management are. It describes the common obstacles that often impair risk management and ways to identify, prioritize, and address these obstacles. What factors affect how risks evolve?Which are the common obstacles to risk management?Which are the policy priorities and institutional solutions that can help overcome obstacles to risk management?",

            "reflection": "1. Risk Management is an integral part of this game as its requires rights actions to be taken at the right time due to the time constraints and the limited resources of funds given. While playing the game there were several areas to be considered that is the associated towards insurance the comets and the other dangers possible. The most important threat was that of the limited time which influenced quick decisions and sometimes the game to spoil because of the lack of the time. There are several requirements to be fulfilled while playing the game. They are as follows:a. Time managementb. Effective planningc. Risk forecasting and efficient planning to overcome themOne of the important indicators for the game is the insurance which enables the protection of the pods form the deep damages and acts as a source of risk management at the time of the fall of the comets. 2. I have played the game several times to understand the knack of playing the game. I have learnt that the game can be only played through proper planning and effective time management. However i have been able to only play for till the second level. I realized the fact that the insurance plays a predominant role in saving at the time of the hit of the comets and its very essential to keep developing the pods as they are always the source of increasing the points.I had realized that the game could only go forward if i made effective utilization of the available as they need not be saved. and must be fully and effectively used. 3. The game is an effective one which helps in analyzing the various aspects of the risk management effectively. However if i had to develop a new game it would contain more effective features of visualizing risk and having better options of improving the conditions of risk management I would aim at developing better sources of developing better risk management tools for the purpose Therefore i can say that risk management is an effective tool forecast thereby control risk in an given scenario.Risk management not only forecasts risk but also suggest measures to control and reduce them so that the disadvantages of them can be reduced effectively. Nevertheless it seen that there are several means of risk management They are as follows:1. Risk Avoidance2. Risk sharing3. Risk Transfer4. Risk diversification5. Risk planningThere are several steps in the risk management process:a. Identification of the objectives: In this stage the objectives of the organisation or the country should be seen.b. Determining the various risks associated  and thereby risk identificationc. Identifying the various available alternatives for effectively controlling the identified risksd. Evaluating the various risk alternatives e. Choosing the best among the available alternatives that best suits the firms or the countries needs and objectivesf. Determining the Risk management policyg. Determining the Risk Management Strategiesh. Adopting the risk management plani. Monitoring of the planj. Review and changes made on the regular basis according to the need and objectivesThus it can be concluded that risk management has been the need of the hour today nations, firms and globalized organisation are aims at designing measures through which they can effectively control the risk and the uncertainties as they have become one of the major reasons for the fall of the several nations and the countries. Today the world bank and the united nations organisation is predominantly aiming at this protection of nations form such risk and uncertainities effectively. ",

            "reflection": "Game Reflection: \n\nIn the course of playing the game\nI learned a few things about risk management:\n\nThe planet Alora is one that is\nprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one that\ncan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen the\nimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect the\nplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:\nDue to limited resources like time and money. We had to make various decisions\nthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming comets\nwere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the comet’s\nseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as research\ntime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take action\nto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,\nit can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level of\nprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect the\nplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance and\ndevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching a\nhigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In the\nbeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and using\nthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase in\nfinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way that\nit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance and\nprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actually\nlessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances of\nhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet through\nobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according to\nthe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not cause\ntoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protect\nAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role in\nreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one has\nto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower the\ncosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on the\nphysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutive\ntime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better that\nis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I would\npropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to the\ncontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relatively\nfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given this\nsituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions with\nlimited and slower growing financial resources.\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon game reflect to the risk faces by everyone and every countries. The role of Risk Management in the game is to protect Alorna from regular natural disaster, hitting by comet and flooding. with good knowledge through series of research will help us to measure what types of risk and its impact and severity, in this game understanding more about the habit and characteristic of the comet, then by that we can develop the right strategy and implementation for protection. Through appropriate protection, increasing the ground level to avoid from flood is necessary. Taking protection actions need resources, then we need to really have a good level of protection of measurement, to make sure that we put the right action and investment (not something fancy  things that beyond the needs), but just right or be realistic in developing the strategy. Preparation  will give immediate impact by avoiding flood, but also after some times, when the comet missed and no flood. at the same time it is also affected to the development (pod) because its increased the regular cost (resources needed). Through a good knowledge (research) of the comet characteristic and measurement of the severity and frequencies, the insurance purchase can be choose based on the severity of potential damage made by the comet. it is also need a good knowledge of the obstacles especially related to lack of resources obstacles in this game, prioritizing the resources without have to jeopardize the environment and pods.in this game, I choose to invest more on pods construction and having minimum insurance purchase (the lower level) considering the possibility and severity of the hit of comet based on the research.   I think, it should be done in simultaneously between all aspects such as building pods those that can generate income, to conduct regular research gathering the information and knowledge that will support in decision making on what next to be done in regards of preparation, insurance and copping.  it will be good to calculate also the cost and benefit analysis between having regular pod or up-grade one, in-term of cost invested (178 to upgrade the pod) and added value received from that.Conduct research on how this building affected to the preparation stages. In general, the game reflect what is risk management. I would make some suggestion on the game such as: more information on how much each pod will give income, is there any impact of having the expanded level of pod, I am still don't understand how to establish the connection in this game. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was to reduce the likelihood\nand impact of damage caused by comets to enable development of the community to\ntake place at an adequate pace. \n\nInitially, I tried to balance investments in the three\npreparation functions available in the game:\n\n1.      \nInsurance, which allowed the use of funds during\ngood times to reduce the financial burden of repairing the community following\na comet impact later on\n\n2.      \nProtection, by raising the land, to reduce the\nlikelihood and impact of damage caused by a comet strike\n\n3.      \nAnd research, to increase knowledge of the risk\nfaced, which also allowed me to better judge whether to invest in, for example,\nin further protection or in development of the city\n\nA number of trade-offs were possible, for example, neglecting\nprotection (raising the land) because of the high cost involved, but taking out\ninsurance policies which would cover a high proportion of the costs of rebuilding\nin the event of damage. In my case, I found that heavy investment in research\nwas effective, because this also allowed time to create community connections,\nwhich was also a protective measure. However, research was quite time\nconsuming, which meant I was less able to spend time raising the land\n(protection) and developing and building the pods. \n\nIn my game, raising the land and research (including\ncreating community connections) both appeared to have short-term payoffs, by\nincreasing my knowledge of the potential risk (allowing me to choose where to\nmake investments) and by reducing the impact of comet strikes. However, it’s\nnot possible to say how effective they were, as it’s not possible to know how\nmuch damage would have been caused in the absence of these measures – at least\nnot without playing the game a second time. This demonstrates the difficulty of\nuncertainty in decision making and also the political difficulty in taking\npreparation measures, which may be costly and have benefits which are less\nvisible, as their success is demonstrated through an impact not happening (or\nbeing less severe). \n\nI played the game only once. In the end, the biggest\ntrade-off I made (and the reason that I only made it as far as level 5), was not\nbetween different preparation measures, but choosing to invest heavily in\nresearch, which reduced the time and resources available for the development\nand construction of pods. The community did not develop quickly enough in level\n5. This was a demonstration that my approach was perhaps too risk-averse;\ninstead of taking the opportunity to develop the community with excess funds, I\ncontinued to undertake activities to prepared for comet strikes – even though the\ncommunity did not suffer any damage until level 5. \n\nIf I were to change one thing, it would be to make less\ndeveloped pods more vulnerable to a comet strike. This would more realistically\ndemonstrate the higher vulnerability of those with less\npower/resource/knowledge etc. and the ability of those with greater resources\nto be more able to withstand disasters and continue to prosper in the face of\nadversity. ",

            "reflection": "The role of this game is very important to me. It enabled me to clearly understand risk management processes. The game is set up and helped me know deeply what I should do to confront the shocks. I had to balance and use eficiently time and budget to build the pods, raise the village, research the comets. After the game, I noticed that I have to apply the knowledge and solutions from The interlinked components of risk management to address the shocks. According to such diagram I have applied \"knowledge\" to identify types of comets, chain of hits, severity and when it attact. Next I apply \"protection method\" to such as raising the village to reach safe levels of 4, 5 or 6, depending on the type of the comets which may impact on the earth. If I do not have time to upgrade the village's land to requied level, I will choose \"insurance method\" by buying insurance for the pods at the highest cost. Besides, I also regularly research the comets in order to reduce impacts if comets hits Earth as \"coping method\"Besides that, when the incident occurred, I had to react quickly by notifing to the whole pods that help them to tacke negative risk and mitigate the bad effects to the village. Infact, applying above measures have helped me achieve a good result and reach level 5. when I play this game for the first time, I distributed inappropriately money, lacked of  knowledge as well as information about the impacts of each comet, raised  unreasonably and inappropriately pods' land, bought insurance when not needed.  In the secon time I play the game, I rised  awareness about the impact of each comet,  height needed of pods' land to avoid impact when comets hit earth and regularly study comets to have a suitable strategy tackling shocks from Comets' hit. The main thing I learn from the game is the suitable way to confront the shocks by applying Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping. ",

            "reflection": "           In this week 2, our aim was to play the game “Risk Horizon” and try to reach the highest level we could – being 6\nthe maximum. In this game we have to develop and take care\nof the world Alora, which is constantly target of different kind of comets. \n\n                While developing our community,\nwe have to research about comets that are threating it, we may take precautions\nor insurances of different levels. If the comets hits, we have to take care of\nthe consequences of it. Repairs are needed, more precaution must be taken and\nespecially research. Not forgetting to keep developing our community, as it not\nalso improves its lifestyle as also improves its communication, as a precaution\nto the threating comets.\n\n                A game will never show us how\nreal case scenarios are or could be when facing a threat; However, this simple\ngame show us how difficult it must be, as it might be a simple game, but not\neasy at all. Managing the funds of the community along with time and threats\ncan be quite challenging. Playing the game a few times was enough for me to\nunderstand that we can not approach one concern more than other. Developing the\nresources of the community and researching about threats are equally important.\nOne can not substitute the other. Neither can insurance take place of\nprecaution. We have to divide our funds, time and worries in everything, as\nthey do not substitute or compensate one for other but complement each other,\nbeing interconnected and essential.\n                Reflecting around this\ntopics and the challenges of the game, we are able to connect it to real life scenarios.\nAfrican countries and developing countries in Asia, like India or Bangladesh,\nfor instance, face this hard challenge every day, every year. All this\ncountries, some more than others, are threat every year with such disasters as\nfloods, fires, hurricanes. Most of them face poverty and hunger, along with few\nresources and low funds. So, we put ourselves in their shoes by playing this\ngame. If they have low funds and resources but are constantly threat by all\nkind of disasters, new or old, how can they face that? They have to get\npriorities.\nIn the beginning we are such as those countries, poor and with lack of\nresources and knowledge.  So, when are\nable to get resources, we should, even if it is not much, it is a start.\nHowever, threats are priorities. When a priority is detected we have to research\nabout it, get to know the severity of it, if it is avoidable. The more we know\nabout the threat, for example, a hurricane, the more we can do. This way we can\nstart preventing the community, so everyone can start to get ready for it, we\ncan create insurances for communities, communities can help each other to avoid\nbigger lost. With knowledge we are able to inform the community so they can\nprevent or, and, also take insurances. That way they will be able to cope when\nit strikes. This is exactly what happened in Bangladesh, thanks to knowledge\nthey could do all this, prepare and cope better when a hurricane was about to\nstrike. This way, they are also developing their country and improving their\nlifestyle and decreasing lost and mortality.\n\n                Without knowledge nothing is\npossible, is the biggest lesson of this game. If you do not have information\nyou can not do anything, neither to prevent or cope with consequences, neither\nto develop. Without knowledge and developing you can not even pass the first level,\nin the game, but also in real life. ",

            "reflection": "The game focused on the preparing for and coping with the outcome of the potential risks that were demonstrated by the comets. I was allocated a certain amount of money every few seconds depending on how developed my city had become. This money was in turn available to either re-invest and further develop my city, pay for insurance or pay for protection.The choice I made was to always save enough money first of all to pay for either level 2 or 3 insurance, then the remainder was spent on development, with any remaining money (under construction/upgrade cost) being spent on protection. I paid the higher amount on insurance so I wouldn't incur great costs even with little protection, This for me was the trade-off, I could either choose high insurance and low protection or, low insurance and high protection. In order to pay for either protection or insurance, this would slow down the rate of development because the opportunity cost of expenditure on those means there was less money available to invest on development. Also, if money was spent on protection, this would stagnate growth completely (hence why I preferred insurance over protection and why I would only spend on protection when I had reached the growth goal for that level.)I would only spend time on research where I had a reasonable level of protection, had already paid for insurance and didn't have enough money to spend on upgrades.I played the game twice, first time I reached level 4 and the second time I reached level five (only losing because a comet hit and did 20% damage with 7 seconds to go!) The difference was that in the first game, I focused much more on protection rather than developing my city. This makes me realise that not all efforts should be put on dealing with risks because it may adversely affect other things such as growth. There also needs to be a lot of balance, it is possible for countries to grow while also protecting themselves from any future risks. If I were to re-create the game, I would create different kinds of risk that have the inverse severity/chance of hitting as the comets meaning the player would would to allocate appropriately where his costs would go to. Another idea would be to have a random 80% comet that hits at any one point between levels 1-6 and if the player hasn't implemented the appropriate measures in that level, it would inflict a massive amount of damage. This ties in with what Erwann said in his video talk about having a short memory and just because we forget what may have happened in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't be expecting it. ",

            "reflection": "Coordination and balancing of\nresources in risk management\n\nBy: Nguyen Duc Tan\n\nThe\nnature of the Risk Horizon game has heightened the need for further\nunderstanding of the role of risk management in the development. The game\nindicated that if we fail to plan or balance knowledge, protection, and\ninsurance, we fail to manage risks effectively. By using the nature of the Risk\nHorizon game, this essay argues that the coordination and balancing of\nresources is very important in the process of risk management for decision\nmaker. \n\nNo\none can deny the importance of risk management when playing Risk Horizon game. In\nany community, especicially in developing countries, development is always under\nscare resourses. How to develop the community under scare resource why meeting a\nlimited or controlled milestone is likely a headache for any decision maker. In\nthe game, the risk management is very important since it requires player to identify\nthe priorities for quick action under scare resources before the comets hit\nwater and cause waves damaging the pods. For example, the player has to decide\nwhat needs to be taken immediately: Research, Insurance, or Protection (as I\nrefer to as “RIP”). For me, I played this game first time and focused heavily\non Protection at first, then could not move to level 3.  Therefore, identification of priorties of\naction is a key to risk management, otherwise obove RIP is likely a kind of “\nRest, In, Peace” for the community.\n\nIf\nI played the game second time, I would do differently by focusing more at first\non research since knowledge and information are very crucial for risk\npreparedness. I have tried the research and know that it definitely increases community’s\ncapacity in their connections against repeated shocks. The key things I have\nlearned from the game is that decision makers and community should try to do\nany actions which cost less to prevent potential shocks before they cost and\nthat Research should come first to save cost and life. This is also a key\nmessage from the game: “Everything we do has some cost, whether in time or\nresources”.\n\nI\nam not alone in my view that potential risks and shocks are diversified in\nterms of impact. Therefore, if I am tasked with developing a new version of the\ngame, I would add at least two more risks into the game. The more risk the game\nhas, the more capacity for risk management shall be likely to be improved. The\nfirst risk is that there is no money left and decision maker has to think about\nhow they can mobilise and engage limited resources from the target community to\nprotect themselves. The second risk is that the comet will hit the community\ndirectly. In that case, evacuation and temporary relocation of community can\narguably be a better option.\n\nThis\nshort essay has discussed the role of risk management via the Risk Horizon game\nand argues that generally good coordination of resources under limited time\nframe and resources is a key to good risk management. The evidence and\nimplication from the game suggest that Research, Insurance, and Protection\nshould be prioritised under specific conditions based good research. More risks\nshould be added into the game to diversify the risk management options to help\ncommunity be better at confronting any potential threats in future.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "Question: What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Answer: Preparation for risk have positive trade offs with development after some time. Spetially protection.Question:  If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?Answer: In my case, any asteroid made any damage cause I had a good level of protection and I had good grow level also. No changes I would madeQuestion: The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Answer:  I´ve being living in some developing countries and htey face a lot of cultural issues lin developing. It is not a trade off betwen protection and development but is the concept of development itself that must be understood.  What is development (in the game) to build more and more houses??  Those young men in the World Bank usually study in a Unniversity and afterthat they thing they can give lessons to everybody but they don´t know about live, and still less about the live in development countries.  Do they really thing that with this stupid game they are going to theach anything?? Any young man here in Veracruz can pass this game easily, and aftherthat, this person will spend all of his money in a party or wathever silly thing because he/she do not understand the purpose of the life itself and why it really matters to grow and protect theirselves.  Imagine: here, you can die everyday in the street because the war betweel the drugsdealers is dangerous. You can go to work and return and see your wife and children dead. Also there is an insurance that you can buy to protect your house from an huricane. Do you think you will act rationally about the huricane insurance? In order to psicologically survive you will need to think that risk does not exist that nothing will happens (maybe because the hollymary protects you or whatever)  Then you will not be rational with the risk management.",

            "reflection": "It is easy to see that only building pods and not spending any money on protection / insurance / knowledge is not enough for healthy development. At any time shocks can happen and destroy much of what you already had. The role of risk management is to minimize, or at least reduce, the losses caused by the meteors.It is definitely not a easy task to choose between building, knowledge, insurance and protection. Money and time were the main obstacles in the game, so planning what to do and where to spend money was a big thing while playing. The first two times I played, first thing I would do is to buy the 75% insurance plan, but that would leave me with not enough money. After a while I figured that maybe saving some money on insurance and investing on protection would have a better result, because when protected, the meteors sometimes had no damage on the city - I guess insurance is important but you have to balance it with protection. When you are well-protected you don't need that much of an insurance.Choosing on what meteor to study was also a tricky task. There is a need to balance the chance of hit and the potential damage of the meteor. After a while I figured that even if the meteor had huge chance of hit, but its potential damage was much lower than my protection, it would be better not to spend much time on it, and study other meteors with higher damage. Besides that, there were faster and slower meteors, hard task. - Balancing the potential damage and the chance of hit is crucial for knowing what risk to study, and it is an important and hard task.One thing I would change about the game is how the damage occurs. When the meteor hits and there is not enough protection, all pods are affected about the same - destroyed by a percentage. It does not happens in real world. For example, in Brazil there are many floods. Sometimes the poor looses 100% of their assets, while the rich doesn't lose anything. Maybe if the smaller pods were affected more then the bigger ones, or the other way around, or even just a random distribution of damage, instead of even, that would represent better how the risk affects the society we live in.",

            "reflection": "In the game, risk management was used as a tool for sustained development. Engaging in research helped me obtain adequate information to predict whether or not the meteorites would hit, and which tools of risk management I should Utilize in order to mitigate damages caused by their occurrence. Insurance help in getting back on my feet after the flood easier and lessen the financial burden. The tradeoffs made during the game depended on decisions i made regarding the use of time and resource. Spending too much time researching on an incoming meteor resulted in less time to protect the village by raising the ground level when other high severity meteors immediately follow the one under study. Insurance put a strain on available resources for further development in the long run as it got more expensive. In general, measures put in place for immediate possible impacts, without regarding future impacts, stifled development in the long run. Planning for both long term and short term provided a more stable condition for development to progress steadily. After playing the games several times, i realised effective risk management as a tool for development can only be achieved when measures for dealing with risks are spread over a variety of tools for a long period of time, and not only focused on one tool. if asked to develop this game id add health insurance",

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms\nof knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk\naffect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nAnswer:\n\nRole of Risk Management in the game\nwas to prepare, sustain, cope and rebuild based on the Research information\ngiven on each Meteor that impact on the planet. \n\nI had to make a calculative risk\nanalysis based on information that was provide, plus on the severity of the\ncomet impact. Hence a calculative assessment was on the making to protect and\npurchase Insurance. If there were any damages, the rebuilding cost was an\nacceptable level. \n\nThe preparation on risk affecting\non development was very minimum and immediate because the knowledge was obtain\ntherefore an effective decision was made. Development of pod was never\nhindered. Hence the key word is “research” to better prepare for any\ncircumstances. Protection is very crucial in any disasters, first we procure\ninsurance for financial aspect but the pod survival was another. We had procure\nadditional coverage for protection by rising the pod level of elevation. \n\n2.      \nIf you played the game only once, what would you\ndo differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the\ngame more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What\nwere the main things you learned from the game?\n\nAnswer:\n\nIf I were to play once, I wouldn’t know\nthe full extend and impact. Therefore by playing additional games we will\nunderstand the gravity of the situation and do a calculative assessment plus\nrisk analysis of the situation. \n\nThe main things I learned in this\ngame is even in such calamities, there is \na provision to prepare, assess the situation and take calculative risk\ntherefore will not feel to full impact of the situation. Hence research is\nextremely important to know our next move plus acceptable risk by procuring\nInsurance to minimize the risk and increase in protection to be taken.\n\nThere are some fundamental analysis\nto be included:-\n\n \n\ni)                   \nEconomic Analysis\n\nii)                  \nResearch Info\n\niii)                \nRisk Analysis3.    The game captures, in a simplified way, some\naspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new\nversion of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What\nchange would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that\nmatter in the place you live?\n\nAnswer:\n\nThe aspect of risk management\n“identifying”, “measuring” and “managing” these are key or the back bone of\nrisk management. Therefore developing a new version of the game, I would add\nChart layout of “Risk Matrix” where player will have a visual aspect of their\nprobabilities. \n\nThe Chart will be their reference\ncharts to make a Calculative Risk Assessments.(Cannot install the chart in)\n\nThe severity of risk and possible consequences\nis quantified by “high”, “Medium” and “Low”. Low could mean that it is not a\nbig risk or there could be a serious risk but it can easily be resolved based\non the information (Research in the game).\n\nIn conclusion, risk management\nmodel consist of probability multiplied by an impact. Understanding\nmultiple probabilities can contribute to Risk total probability. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game is avoiding falling comets in the process of developing the community. The main role is to balance between growing community and preparing for the potential shocks. Because each actions I could use to manage risk will cost the precious resources (eg. Time, power, money is limited), I have confronted tradeoffs in terms of knowledge, protection and insurance. Purchasing an insurance in advance could reduce the repair cost after the community has been damaged and there are different insurance plans to choose. I has chosen the most expensive one because I want the lowest repair fee. However, this cost a lot and the money I could use is limited. The other choice is to do more research and gain more knowledge about the comet. This can give me more time to create community connections and help me boost my protection. If I choose to protect my community first, I could prevent the pods from being damaged. However, the more I lift, the more power will cost. I have to make decision between these factors and to choose the orders of them I will use. Only this can helo me find the perfect balance and create a healthy community and legacy. Overall I have chosen to protect my community in advance rather than taken actions after have been damaged. I usually purchase an insurance first and learn the properties of each comet. If the comet is quite ‘dangerous’, I will increase my protection immediately. The most difficult thing is that not everything is under your control and you will never know how many comets will come. Sometimes you have to wait and see your community being destroyed without doing anything due to limited money, power or time. I have played this game twice, the first time I only passed the first three level. I failed because I have no money to reconstruct my community and there were too many comets. My resource was used up rapidly after continuos shocks. I has forgot to purchase an new insurance in the next round, which lead to an unaffordable repair fee. The second time I stated to store my precious resource in the beginning and try my best to allocate the resource more effectively. I also has chosen to purchase the most expensive insurance in the beginning of each level. Only in this way can I lay a foundation for the following levels. However, the balance is hard to keep (eg. To do research first or to increase the capacity of protection first). Sometimes I has made suboptimal choices in case of a sudden attack. There is not enough time for me to think twice. If I could change or add one thing in this risk management game, I would add the chance to borrow fund in case of the money running out. Maybe one can borrow 500 money once and pay some interest and the debt must be paid back before the time si running out. From my point of view, fund is vital to better manage risk because each simple action costs money. The chance to borrow can be a capital buffer to against sudden shock. However, this option will make the risk management decision more complicated. If one cannot manage the debt well, the probability to fail will increase. All in all, I love to play this game and this has left a deep impression on me.",

            "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game was about finding the right balance of\nknowledge, protection, insurance and coping to manage risk within the limitations\nof the resources I had available.  \n\nI found that, if I built up my knowledge of the risks and\nfocussed on those that had the most likelihood of impact and severity, then I\nprogressed further and faster and often I was able to avoid the risk\neventuating.   \n\nAlso, I found that regular review and upgrading of my\ncurrent assets as well as raising the level of the island (protections) allowed\nfor continuous development of the community.  The more proactive I was in managing risk, the\nimpact was reduced, I built up my resources faster, and I progressed further\nand faster in the game. \n\nIn terms of insurance, it made more sense to insure more\nheavily when there were more assets and/or when a risk was likely to occur or\nto be severe.  This was particularly the\ncase when several high risk shocks were likely to occur.  \n\nHowever, despite attempting to research all the potential\nshocks, there were still some that caught me by surprise. \n\nWhen damage occurred, it was relatively inexpensive to make\nrepairs as soon as possible and when I did so it seemed that this enabled me to\nprogress faster.  It was important to do make\nrepairs while continuing to monitor potential future shocks as it was likely\nthat the damage would be worse if there were unrepaired assets.  \n\nShocks also seemed to destroy or reduce the effectiveness of\nsome of the previously installed protections. \nI found it best to try and repair these as soon as possible so that continual\nupgrades could occur.\n\nThe further the game progressed, and the more developed the\ncommunity, the higher and faster the resources seemed to grow.  This was good as it enabled me to keep\nupgrading and also insuring the assets.  \n\nI learnt, the first time playing the game,  that prioritising and balancing the risk\nmanagement strategies was the best way to progress.  It seemed, however, that constant research\nand focussing on the worst risks remained the most important strategy to manage\nrisk as this enabled me to prioritise my actions according to the most likely\nimpacts.\n\nIf I were able to redesign the game, I would probably add several\ndifferent options for protection including some that cost no money but only\ntime.  This would more realistically\nreflect the risk management approaches that I currently take in my current place\nof residence.\n\n",

            "reflection": "The main purpose in the game is to apply in “real-life\nsituation” two main objectives of risk management: produce resilience\nmitigating losses from the negative shocks and achieve prosperity in\nthe developing community by building pods, earning money and investing\nin the future development.\n\nWhile playing the game we learned to apply main\nconcepts of risk management: preparation, knowledge, protection and coping with\nthe outcomes. The game starts with the opportunity given: we have the finances\nthat can be invested in building of pods. However, as in real life situation we\nwere confronted with the negative shocks which occurred gradually (we could see\nthe comet coming and had time to do some actions to prepare). In order to\nprepare for the shock we had the following tools:\n\nKnowledge. We could perform researches\n     to find out about the potential risks we had to confront (severity of the\n     comet meaning how much distraction it will cause and assess the chances of\n     its hitting the water).\n Insurance. We could insure our\n     pods from the risk which can help us in the future to cope with the\n     outcomes. Basically we shared the costs of recovery.\n Protection. We could invest in\n     protection. Protection costs money but it worth financing due to its positive\n     outcomes in the near future. Results of protection sometimes cannot be\n     seen because we don’t know what could have happened if required actions of\n     preparation were not used, however, they are needed to be implemented to\n     decrease future costs while being in the stage of recovery. \nThe process of coping in the game was depending\nfrom the actions taken while preparing. The higher the level of preparation was\nused, the easier the process of coping.  \n\nMore research made, gave us\n     more time to use community for recovery process.  \n The more expensive insurance was\n     used, the easier and cheaper it was to recover in case of comets with high\n     severity level.\n By increasing level of\n     protection, we were able to cope with comets with low level of severity.\n     Even though they hit the water, no or little damage was made.  \nThe most difficult during the game\nwas to find the required sequence of actions in which risk management has to be\nimplemented and create the strategy for preparation and coping. I’ve played the\nfirst level for several times, and the most successful was when I decided to\npay more attention to the research of the comets and my horizon began to grow\nand turned green which gave me the sign that my actions were correct. During the\nfirst level it was necessary to get acquainted with the nature of the risk and\nperform research. In case the severity of comet was too high to cope, and I understood\nthat my level of protection was not that high, I just tried to make diligent\nresearch and get the most expensive insurance. However, I always had to\nremember to leave some money for recovering from damages. During the second\nlevel of the game I invested in development by building more pods, bought\ninsurance, invested in protection and continued to make researches but were not\nable to receive the required level in horizon.\n\nIn order to change one thing in the\ngame I would propose to add financing instrument. That is one of the problems\nwhich we are confronted in Ukraine while confronting with risks.  There can be new tool implemented called “bank”\nfor example. In case we invested too much in construction and now don’t have\nmoney to cover for destructions, we can take a loan. As well as we can make\nsome savings for the future and get extra income by earning interest income. ",

            "reflection": "The aim in the game is to develop the island taking into account\nnot only the time and the money one has, but also the possibility of damages\ncaused by comets that can impact on the planet. The tool we can use to manage the\nrisk in the game is the window to monitor the behaviour comets. This way, we\ncan predict the danger we will have to\nface in order to decide how to use\nour resources (time and money) for developing the island the best way possible.\n\nIn facts, thanks to this tool, one can know the «Chance of hit»\nand the «Severity of the impact» of each comet. This way, one can decide:\n\n-       \neither to not monitor the comets too much (in the case it has a\nlow «Chance of hit» or «Severity of the impact») and use the time to lift the\nisland\n\n-       \nor to monitor it properly (in the case it has a high «Chance of\nhit» and/or «Severity of the impact») and save money for further\ndevelopment/restoration/insurance; in this case, moreover, we gain some “extra”\ntime to reduce the damages.\n\n \n\nIn fact, there is not enough time to both monitor completely the comet and lift the island, so I needed a trade-off\nbetween the two aspects. Moreover, when I was not satisfied with the\nprecautions I was taking, I also opted for different levels of insurance. All\nthese moves were bounded by the available money (and the willing to go on\ndeveloping).\n\nPersonally:\n\n-       \nI preferred to try to avoid\ntoo-high insurances in order to save\nmoney for the development and the lifting of the island. On the other hand,\n\n-       \nI tried to avoid lifting\nthe island too much not to waste money. Moreover, this way, I was also saving time in order to monitor the dangerous comets as much as\npossible.\n\n \n\nIn my case, I think, preparation for risk was affecting the\ndevelopment in a long-term scenario.\nFor example, as said before, I was monitoring the dangerous comets as much as I\ncould and I tried to lift the island little by little in order to not have to\nloose time and money repairing the damaged buildings. This way, I had to wait to\nfinish the first levels to have a “very-lifted” island but, at the same time, I\nmanaged to have well-developed buildings.\n\n \n\nI played the game only once but, if I were to play it again, I\nwould choose less insurance as I did since I saw that I was able to affectively\nlimit the damages.\n\nI learned from the game that is really important to use the tools\navailable for “monitoring” the risks in order to be able to predict the possible scenarios and,\naccordingly, be able to choose the best trade-offs needed to reach the final\naim.\n\n \n\nI would like to add the possibility of earthquakes, this way one\nhas to deal also with a risk that is “unpredictable”.\nFor example, one can learn how to:\n\n-       \ntake reasonable extra-precautions,\n\n-       \nface an\nunexpected situation and\n\n-       \nhow to change his plans while the work is going on.",

Tried as much as possible to notice the pattern of strikes and trend of the game, then tried to build and upgrade structures as much as possible before first strike, build a strong protection based on information gotten from research on each meteor, then get the best insurance plan for relatively cheap and quick recovery after strike if any damages was caused at all.3.

            "reflection": "In the Risk Horizon game, successful risk management\nwas the goal of the game and the only way to advance your community’s development.\nAs I gained more experience, I realized it was more efficient to sacrifice some\nprotection in order to gain more knowledge through research while playing the\ngame. Additionally, insurance was a useful tool in situations where more than\none meteor (the source of the risk) was occurring in close succession. Also in\nmy experience, preparation for risk made development slower—as more time and\nresources were spent on protection, there was less wealth available for\nupgrading existing pods or building new ones. \n\nNext, having played the game more than once, my\nstrategy evolved as I went. First I figured out that I was more likely to meet\nthe development goal when my community was comprised of more lower-grade pods\nthan if it had higher-grade pods. Although the higher-grade pods were more\ndeveloped, there was a trade-off and diminishing returns to them if any damaged\noccurred. For example, the higher-grade pods were more expensive to repair so\ntherefore the meteors were causing more damage that could not be repaired\nbefore time ran out. Following, I think the most important thing I learned in\nthe game was the importance of community connections as a form of insurance and\na way of managing risk. If I saw a severe meteor was coming in too fast, I\noften relied on community connection as a way to minimize the imminent damage. \n\nFinally, one very frustrating aspect of the game was\nthat the time in the level did not end once the development goal was reached.\nThere were many levels in which I had already reached the development goal but\nwhen a devastating meteor appeared in the last 30 seconds I simply did not have\nenough time to prepare so I would lose that level. Therefore, one thing I would\nadd to the game would be an early warning system, like a “seven day forecast”\nof the upcoming meteors before they come into view. I think this would be a\npractical additional tool for risk management in the same way that a seven day\nforecast and storm watch systems are useful for managing the risk of snow\nstorms in New England. ",

            "reflection": "1. The role of risk management was at the heart of the\ngame.  At every point of the game, you\nneeded to balance between building and upgrading pods (development) and protecting\nyour investment through research (knowledge) or raising the island\n(protection).  When this failed,\ninsurance was the fallback to mitigate losses.  Initially, I emphasized the development aspect\nbecause it was necessary to further build pods. \nHowever, as comets entered play, I would invest in research despite the\ncost.  I would click on the comets to see\nwhat the severity of the impact would be. \nIf it was high, I would increase the level of protection.  Knowledge was key to being prepared, even if\nit meant just spending a few seconds on a meteor.  Without any knowledge, it was a complete guesswork\nas to whether or not the level of protection was adequate or if insurance was\nneeded.  With knowledge at hand, I could\nmake an educated decision that would lower the risk of damage and also lower my\ncosts.  Ideally, it was by investing in\nprotection, since damages not only set me back financially but also affected my\ndevelopment level. Also, protection carried over to the next levels as opposed\nto insurance that needed to be renewed. If it was clear that I would not have\nenough time to protect myself, I would make an informed decision on how much\ninsurance to take based the severity of the shock and the likelihood. \n\nFor example, if the severity was at a bar 6, I kept in mind that\nmy research (and community connections) could provide me up to 2 bars of\nprotection. Therefore, I used my slider to raise the island up to bar 4 before\nthe shock. If I didn’t have enough time to reach that level, I purchased an\ninsurance plan. This technique would minimize the damage and bring me to the\nnext level.  Finally, once my development\nwas at its maximum for a given level, I would divert all my remaining time to\nraising my protection in anticipation for the next level.\n\n 2. I played the\ngame several times (probably too much!) and it took me a while to really\nunderstand the causes and effects of the different functions. In the beginning,\nI was building too fast and didn’t really know how to use the research function\nor I invested too much in protection/insurance. I mostly learned how to\ninterpret the information and that not every comet required an action on my\nbehalf. When I felt like I was not making any progress, I had to go back and\nread the instructions. It gave me a better and clearer understanding.  The main thing I learned was the importance of\nunderstanding the correlation and interaction between the various factors that\ncome into play in a given situation.\n\n \n\n3. I would\npropose that whenever a player fails a level, he would go back to a previous\nlevel, not necessarily always the first one (random?) because failing to\nachieve a goal in life doesn’t always send you back to square one.   ",

            "reflection": "Essay about\nRisk Horizon\n\nThe games\nhistory base and story line was to present the choices you as a community have\nto choose between. Is wealth the only way to go or do you also need knowledge\nand preparation about the dangers to come. My experience with Risk Horizon was,\nas the video lectures, that preparation is key. If the community isn’t prepared\nfor a disaster then you’re really in trouble. But preparation can stand-alone;\na community can’t put all of there resources into preparation because how are they\ngoing to survive then? So I learned the trade-off’s the community faces when a\ndisaster occurs. The best mix of goods is in my opinion 40% preparing, 30%\ngrowth in wealth and the last third is knowledge about the disasters. This is\nnot only the order they should occur, it should depend on how urgent the\ndisaster is. If there is time for growth in wealth and knowledge before the\ndisaster occur it would be the best solution but again wait and se how the\nscenario develops and react on the base of that. \n\nMy own\nperformance in the game was level three and I fail to make the society grow\nenough so along side preparation I couldn’t make it to the next level.\n\nThe game\nwas surprisingly true to the hard choices the community faces when a disaster\noccurs and I have learned to use the tools given by the MOOC.",

            "reflection": "The game consists of 4 factors of risk management; defined as knowledge, protection, insurance and coping in the course. There are also; the obstacles faced or scarce resources like time, financial assets and ability to analyze the situation and utilize the tools. First; the level of knowledge or even awareness about the risks should be increased, like increasing the research factor of the comets. Then increase  protection, but it should be balanced with the development activities since too much protection wastes sources of the community which can be directed to development. Insurance can also be used for recovering after a disaster, but financing the costs of this tool should be kept in mind. The last factor, coping abilities of the community which also needs agility in the game, provides after disaster recovery by using networking.     \n\nIn the game, comets are the threat against development of the community. And I had to optimize the usage of the resources for the preparation activities, by decision making which had obstacles like limited time, knowledge and skills. Preparation for the risk, either can prevent the damage all together or reduce the degree of damage. Recovery after a disaster is also less costly if you had preparation beforehand.I played the game more than once. The first one lasted too quickly because I didn't do any research about the comets. Since I was involved in learning the other aspects of the game. On other trials as I get familiar with the game, I started to use the factors of the game more effectively. When I paid too much attention on protection for instance, development fall behind. \n\nThis game of simplified model of risk management, can be developed by adding a random option of \"guess\" about the upcoming comet's feature. If the player is able to guess the feature correctly a bonus maybe given, otherwise a penalty given.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management was predominant in the game “Risk Horizon.” The main objective of this game was\nto manage risks, which mainly took the form of asteroids.Alternatives to managing the\nrisk included upgrading primary “pods” or settlements, purchasing insurance, increased\nprotection, and research.  The greatest\nbarrier to managing risk was the limited financial resource.  Specifically at the beginning of the game\n(where one has fewer financial resources), the barrier to risk management was\ngreatest due to the cost of management methods. \nA player must assess what they can afford as a management means, and how\nlong it would take their planet (or settlements) to re-generate the financial\nresources.  Upon reaching later levels of\nthe game, the financial barrier to risk management is reduced, especially if a\nmultiple of settlements are upgraded.  \n\n\n\nIn the earlier levels, common\ntrade-offs included fewer research and greater protection and/or\ninsurance.  The reason for this was\nbecause I as a player did not see immediate benefits to the research conducted,\neven in the later levels.  Due to this\nrisk management approach, if my planet was hit by an asteroid it didn’t cost\nmuch, or the planet had a high level of protection resulting in no damage.  Such risk avoidance further reduced any\nincentive to finance research and gather information of the asteroids.  This resulted in a planet that did not gather\ninformation but had multiple upgraded facilities with higher insurance policies\nand protection. \n\n\n\nI played both a demo/trial\nversion and the official game.  Having\nplayed the trial version first I didn’t find any immediate benefit to financing\nresearch.  The information for each\nasteroid was presented if it was clicked upon, thus there seemed no reason to\nfurther research the risk, but rather finance other risk management options\nsuch as insurance and protection. \n\n Changes I would propose for\nthis game center on the risk management method of research.  Although I am aware this is a game meant to\nsimplify risk management themes, I consider the research/knowledge gathering\nmethod to be undervalued in this game.  To\nreflect the true importance of research/information gathering in risk\nmanagement, the game should provide less information about the risk of each\nasteroid.  Such a lack of information, or\nuncertainty would create an incentive for the player to finance research in\norder to better understand the magnitude each risk (asteroid) represents.  Slowly the game should reveal more\ninformation of each asteroid (such as how often the asteroid orbits the planet\nor may hit it), and this would then alter how the finances are allocated.  If the game remains as is, there is little\nincentive for players to fund research (as I have mentioned previously above),\nand rather allocate finances to insurance and protection.  In reality, risk management approaches such\nas insurance are not as preventative as research, but more retrospective. \n\n\n\nOverall I thought the game\nwas well designed to illustrate the difficulties presented to low-income areas,\nand the decisions faced by risk-prone locations. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management played a pivotal role in this game in\nprioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them. Its role can be outlined as\nbelow:\n\n·        \nTo ensure long-term survival of the community of\nAlora\n\n·        \nTo provide immediate protection and relief from\nshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insurance\n\n·        \nTo ensure timely and justified protection at the\ntime of crisis\n\n \n\nImportant choices had to be made for each crisis according\nto its severity. Due to limited resources, it was\nimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimum\nutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching the\nisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basis\nof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance of\na hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I would\nimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gather\nknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal in\nsafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, being\ncomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making a\ntrade-off between risk and resources, I was\nable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.\n\nWhile making preparations for the shock, again a\ntrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due to\nlimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted so\nthat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would not\nupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buy\ninsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on development\ndue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain more\nresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resources\nwas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoided\nby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of development\nslowed down the process of growth of resources.\n\n \n\nHaving played the game more than once, I learnt certain\nvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.\nInitially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize the\nrisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized that\ndevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick pace\nto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary to\nprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, I\nbegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordingly\nspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community against\nthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive the\nbarrage of incoming comets. \n\nThis game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-world\ncrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of time\nmanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct and\njustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.\n\n \n\nHailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize that\ncorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequate\nsocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in risk\nmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a just\nand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice to\nall citizens of the community.\n\n ",

            "reflection": "Good day,\n\nFirst, I have to confess that I like this game.\nWhen I had heard about it at first time, I was assuming it quite boring like\nthe most of educational games. And I was wrong.Security and extension linked in this game. You\nhave to keep your security strong at the expense of evolving, but you also need\nto improve your economy.\n\nAt the beginning of the game you have enough\nmoney for both: defense and investments in the economy. To my mind, stages from second to\nfourth (inclusively) have more importance before others - you have to plan your\nactions very carefully and maintain a middle ground between development and\ndefense. Last stages are quite easy - you have enough money for everything you\nneed.\n\nI played this game twice. At my first attempt I\ncaught a game's fatal error at the last stage, so I tried again. Insurance is a\nbit useless and comets research is really nice - that experience I got from my\nfirst try. In real life I really like insurance, but in the game it does not\nwork as effectively as I expected. It’s too expensive for the middle and early\nphases of the game - you better invest that money in defense and extension.\nNevertheless I bought it in the late phase in order to copying. And comets\nresearch is very helpful and cheap, and can save your economy.\n\nIf I was tasked with developing a new version\nof the game, I’d rework insurance part. Maybe something like insurance history - almost like in real life.\nWould make insurance more efficient, but every insurance event significantly increase\nthe cost of the new one. For this reason, a long time without incident makes\ninsurance cheaper. I live in Russia and I think it reflects the idea of ​​risk\nmanagement in my country - you should always have a higher level of security\nand several reserve funds, and also maintain a good reputation.As I said - I like this game. It showed me that:You have to be always prepared;You have to research future risks (literally);You can deal with the same risks in a several\nways;With proper risk management you  can achieve\nprosperity and stability even when it seems that it is impossible(like on the planet where in three minutes time six or seven comets can fall);Thank you\nfor your attention. Sorry for my English.\n\nSincerely,\nMichael.\n\n",

            "reflection": "REFLECTIONThe game basically\ntalks about how we the (individuals, nation. etc) should be able to prepare for\nrisk and at the same time investing in developmental projects. The role of risk\nmanagement in the game is to cope and prepare for the uncertainty whilst taking\nadvantage of opportunities through the building of developmental projects. Through\npreparation (by investing or doing a research on the comets), one is able have\na knowledge to face any shock these comet may pose.  Ways\nin which Preparation of risk affect our developmentKnowledge, protection\nand insurance constitute preparation. Preparing for risk either through\nresearch or knowledge helps to minimise the level of shock that will occur. Having\nan informed knowledge and taking practical steps about certain uncertainty may eliminate\nsome of the obstacles we might face in our developmental goals. Depending on the amount\nof wealth at hand, sometimes is very important not to invest in insurance at\nthe initial stages. The type of insurance to buy is basically dependent on the\nknowledge of the risk one has. Insurance companies can sell a product which\nwill not be beneficial if you don’t have any knowledge of the risk at hand.As the saying goes, ‘prevention\nis better than cure’- is very prominent to protect ourselves rather than\nthinking of having a cure for it. In certain instances, the cost to prevent an\nimpending danger is relatively less than the cost in repairing it. For example,\nin Ghana where the rate of mosquito related diseases is higher, is advisable for\nthe populace to protect themselves using mosquito nets or using insecticide2When I played the game once,\nI was focusing all my attention and resources on building and upgrading the\npods to the detriment of investing in developing the community. For instance I\npaid more attention on buying insurance and I was not able to progress pass\nlevel 1. I then realised that to strategically balance preparing for risk and\ninvesting in developing the community, I should equally gain knowledge (research)\nand  have a form of protection. I have learnt a lot of\nlessons from playing the game. Playing the game has enlightened be to be very\nobejective. I need to get myself prepared and take on some risk or sometimes I\nneed to act when a shock has occurred. I also learnt that increased information\nvia research helped me to understand the nature and the likelihood of risk i.e.\nreducing the uncertainty. Through the knowledge gained, I was able to protect\nmyself from any eventualities with the aim to mitigate losses and increase any\nprobability and positive outcome. During the game, one remarkable thing that I\nlearnt was that Protection and having knowledge in itself is not sufficient to\neliminate or minimise risk. Sometimes, one has to go the extra mile of\nobtaining insurance to help cushion the blow of any shock in an adverse\nsituation.3.\nCrises\nrepeatedly happen because people fail to implement the needed improvement in\nrisk management (World Bank Report, 2014). In my current city Coventry (UK),\nwhen snow falls during winter time, is extremely dangerous to drive or walk\naround. In my candid opinion there should be stringent laws to help save lives\nduring those seasons. For instance there is a law in Germany which oversee to\nit that individuals are to clear all snow (ice) in front of their houses,\ndrivers to put on winter tyres. The loss of live that occurs during such period\ncan be reduced if such laws are adhered strictly as in Germany.    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

            "reflection": "This game made risk management and its challenges tangible by managing the few mechanisms in this fast paced meteor environment. The main challenge was balancing these techniques and investment in resources. A key lesson was that protection was a long term investment and that research also allowed to cope in a cost effective way. The main role of risk management in the game was to manage the\nimminent and ongoing risks of the meteors hitting the development. Namely, we\nhad to try to maintain a level of development while choosing the right time and\namount of protection by lifting the land to reduce or prevent the impact of the\nshocks, an optimal amount of insurance to transfer the wealth to times of need,\nand sufficient research to allow our pods to prepare and pool resources to help\ncoping mechanisms. This was not always easy as we had to choose the right\namount of each to continue to provide sufficient development. Obviously, you\ncannot invest in research and protection at the same time, and you have to\nspread your money across the three components as well as your developments. \n\nIf you invest too much in these risk management techniques,\nyour development suffers and you lose the level. Each of the components had\ndifferent impacts on your development -if you invest in insurance, your\ndevelopments may still be impacted by the shock and you need to try to repair\nwith limited resources, while research allowed you to evade the impact of the\nshocks at a limited cost and protection was a long term investment for your\npods. So we had to try to choose the balance of these components that were effective\nand cost efficient in the circumstances, in a fast paced environment. \n\nAs I continued to play, I found the most useful technique\nwas protection, as this was a long term solution that proved cheaper than insurance\nas my development advanced, and freed my resources to continue developing. This\nwas an interesting reflection of the challenges we face in the real world-\nwhere knowledge of research and even understanding of risk management\ntechniques can influence coping mechanisms. As I became more confident in the\nprocess, I could make the most of times when I had good level of protection to\ninvest and develop- which was another valuable lesson. Basically, the game helped\nmake these risk management techniques tangible and understand the challenges\nthat can emerge in deciding upon risk management in a fast paced environment.\n\nOne mechanism that would the game more realistic for me\nwould be information on which pods were running more profitably or choose to\ninvest in an accountant who can help you decide on which risk management\ntechniques are more efficient, as this is information you would have in the real\nworld and can help you make better investments. Another mechanism would be\nother risks, perhaps meteor showers on the pods or differences of opinion between\nthe pods because these are other kind of risks that would influence this world\nand how they would cope from the shocks that affect it.While these mechanisms would make the game more realistic for me, there were many lessons in risk management that I will take into the future.",

It involved the protection of the\nsettlement, research of the comets as well as insuring the settlement against\ndamage. The aim of the game was to allocate resources in such a manner that\nresearch, insurance and protection would take place in such a way that it would\nbe beneficial for the settlement, and reduce the possible damages from\napproaching comets. Risk management was an essential part of the game not only\nfor the reason that it involved the reduction of the possible risks from the\ncomets colliding with the settlement but also because it lead to development of\nthe settlement, exactly how it leads to the development on an international as\nwell as a macro level.  Another important part of the game was using\nresources for what was actually necessary for the development of the\nsettlement. If I were to play the game again I would probably try harder to\nbalance the utilisation of my money and time. At times I would end up wasting\ntoo much money on protection rather than research hindering my ability to\nreduce damage from incoming comets. I also managed to understand how risk\nmanagement is associated with time, risk management, undoubtedly, has to be\ntimely in order to be efficient, effective and beneficial. I concluded that\nresearch was more valuable in comparison to protection and hence I was able to\nrectify this and create a more desirable balance in the later stages of the\ngame. I was able to reflect the importance of insurance with the help of the\ngame, in the first level I found myself losing a lot of my money because I\nspent large amounts on repairing damages, however I was able to minimise this\nin the later stages of the game hence I realised how critical insurance is to\nrisk management and reduction. Research also proved to be an invaluable tool,\nit gave me a possible glimpse of the extent of the damage a comet could cause\nand the possibility of it causing a damage, if I were to play the game again I\nwould probably focus more on those comets that had a higher probability of\ncausing damage to my settlement and ignore the ones that did not.  If\nI were to redesign the game I would probably reduce the amount of money\navailable to the players at a given amount of time for the reason that in\nreality, in most developing countries where risk management is essential,\nresources have to be used in a more efficient and stringent way than the way they\nwere used in the game where the amount of resources were plentiful at times.",

            "reflection": "\n\n \n\nThis was one very tricky and interesting game with a lot\nof teaching capacities. \n\nHow I managed the insurances, information (knowledge)\nand protection?\n\nInsurance: I did not spend a lot of money in insurance\nin the first level as the investments on the pods were low. Thus, I preferred to\ninvest in longer term such as protection. However, as the capital value of the\npods increased, I preferred to have a higher insurance coverage (75%). This taught\nme to balance the expenses of possible floods with minimum expenses. \n\nKnowledge and Protection: Each comet had its data on\nprobability and possible damages it might cause. According to those data I prepared\nfor the ‘unknown’. I cases where probability was high with minimum damages, I invested\nless on the protection while investing more in development, and similarly when\nthe probability was very low.  As the\nprobability and potential damages became higher I invested on protection more\nthan development. Thus, I managed to escape floods, and even when I did not the\nfloods were less intensive causing fewer damages. As a result I had to invest\nless on rebuilding the pods. The game is also created to make us understand how to deal with the intensity of the information coming in. The comet attacks were increasing at rapid pace, those, if not well prepared during 'peaceful' times in the first and second level, it becomes more difficult to cope in the coming levels. \n\nI have played the game more than once. In the\nbeginning, I invested only in development and ignored the risk management\nissues to see the impact it will have in the game and vise-versa. Therefore, I learned\nthat those factors are interconnected. Development and risk management are directly\nproportional and affect each other significantly. Afterwards, I started to pay\nmore attention to the information I was receiving about the damage capacities\nand probabilities of the comets, and based on that information I acted\naccordingly. \n\nIf I had the chance to make one single modification to\nthis game to improve the risk management I would have added the human factor.\nEven if the floods are low but citizens are not well informed how to react, the\nhuman lives would be in stake. Therefore, I suggest to add the public awareness as a\nrisk management tool.\n\nAll in all, this game has improved my capacity of\nbetter analyzing and overseeing the potential risk. In addition to that I have\nalso learned how to cope and prepare myself to shocks strike. Development\nwithout risk management is not enough. A potential shock might, depending on\nthe intensity, might bring misery and poverty to those affected. \n\n \n\n \n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk Horizon Game: Short Essay.\n\n \n\nThe role of risk management in the\ngame was to ensure that the creation and subsequent development of an Alien\ntown, was not ruined by a major risk (incoming asteroids). Thus, whilst\ndeveloping the town, risk management was essential in order to not ruin the\ndevelopment. Many things had to be taken into account, and preparing for these\npossible risks was crucial. \n\n \n\nThe first choice I made was to obtain\nat least basic insurance, as this would protect the development. Common\ntrade-off were between protection and insurance. I would ultimately make sure I\nwas insured, but always try to use the protection bar as much as possible. The\nmore I was prepared, the easier it was to deal with the effects of asteroids. Thus,\ndevelopment actually become a lot easier. For instance, the researching the\npotential threat of the asteroids aspect enabled me to prepare more, and\nenabled me to make educated decisions about what I should do. Thus instead of\nacting on pure conjecture, I could actually make approximations to how exactly\nthe asteroids would affect my development. \n\n \n\nAfter the first game, I realised the\nimportance of this. I had not researched the threats of the asteroids so much\nbefore. After the first game though, I did. This allowed me to plan a lot more\nextensively and appropriately. \n\n \n\nI live in the Netherlands. So instead of asteroids, the risk would be\nbased around flooding. Thus, risk management would revolve around predicting\nand dealing with flood risks. \n\n",

            "reflection": "Risk management was central to the game. Because each of the different risk management techniques required resources, their use had to be traded against development gains. Each of the risk management techniques also had to be balanced, in terms of the time and resources needed to activate the protection. It was all too easy to get caught out with unprotected costs at the end of the stage, with little time to undertake repairs! The immediate affect on development was slower growth and upgrading. In the longterm, it allowed for progression to the next stage by protecting gains.I played the game more than once. As I played, I understood the role of research better. My approach become this: identify comet, get one or two research points, if it looks like a high risk comet then I continued to research while accumulating funds. I also increased insurance levels. I learned from the game the importance of planning ahead, and with information, developing a short term protection strategy and building up buffers to recover from the shock. I also learnt of the capriciousness of the disaster events. Sometimes, despite the best laid plans, your development goals can still be missed.The game has been developed with a single threat and a single measure of development. While this is a simple model of development, I think it would be interesting to add a second type of threat (helping to represent the complex nature of risks to development) or a range of development factors that need to be considered together in unison. For instance, education, health and wealth of the inhabitants of the community. Perhaps the governance of the community could be an additional facet of the game? Different forms of governance could present new barriers, or make certain types of protection more effective. For instance, community support networks could be more effective where a strong civic sense has been created or where governance is responsive to citizens demands.",

            "reflection": "REFLECTION OF RISK HORIZON GAMEThe objective of this game is to develop\na ‘society’ on an island. As the decision maker in this game the challenge is to\nbalance the development of society with managing the risk for meteor impacts.\nRisk management in this game embodied the trade-off between spending money on\nprotection and insurance against the effects of meteor impacts, on research on\nthe chance and severity of the meteor impacts and on the development of society\nby building and expanding houses. Each choice had an impact on the other.\nProtection meant less chance on the risk of meteors actually hitting the\nisland, insurance meant financial support when an impact did happen and\nresearch led to more understanding of the risk and therefore more time to\naccurately prepare for it.Placing\nthis game in the frame of the last few lectures helps understanding the\ntheoretical concept of risk management. Effective risk management in this game\nmeant mitigating the damage of property (thus losses) and developing society\n(thus the benefits). This clearly reflects the goal of risk management. In\norder to achieve that objective, risk management in this game is more than just\npreparing for the risk by protection and insurance. This aspect really\nreflected that preparing for the risk doesn’t mean it won’t happen anymore, you\nstill need to be able to cope with the risk. In this game coping with the\naftermath also impacted the development of society and the level of success in\nthe game. Playing the game multiple times has\nallowed me to learn from previous mistakes in the allocation of money.\nDeveloping society meant less money towards protection and insurance and vice\nversa. However, sound spending of money on protection, insurance and research\nmeant more opportunity for solid development. Understanding the reciprocity\nbetween these trade-offs led to sound decision-making in the allocation of\nmoney in order for society to develop despite of the risks of meteor impacts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I could change anything it would be\nthe use of insurance in the game. Now it is a ‘one-time-only’ decision per level.\nBut it should reflect the changes in the development of society more as it does\nin real life. More property value means more insurance premium. This evolvement\nisn’t reflected in the game. Therefore I would suggest to change insurance so\nit isn’t sufficient anymore if the property value has increased too much. This\nallows for a better understanding of insuring your property for its actual\nvalue against risks. Overall, I appreciate this game as a valuable means for understanding the different concepts of risk management and applying these concepts in real life.",

            "reflection": "For me, the\nRisk Horizon Game is a good instrument to understand in a practical way,  the main concepts of Risk Management presented\nin Chapter 1 and 2 of the World Development Report 2014, representing a\nsituation of systemic risk of being impacted by a comet shower.The role of\nthe risk management described is not only reducing the negative effects of the\nrisk, but increasing the positive effects, serving as a tool for development.The game presents  in a very simplified way the Risk Management Model,\nconformed by  two phases: the Preparation\nor “ex ante” phase and the Coping or “ex post” phase  and  three components: Knowledge (actions to\nimprove understanding of possible shocks and their potential outcomes);  Protection (actions to reduce the probability\nor magnitude of losses from negative shocks, or to increase gains from positive\nshocks); and Insurance (actions to transfer resources from good to bad times,\nor to those most in need in bad times), showing the inverse interrelation\nbetween the two phases and the necessity of having a good balance between the\nthree components to achieve a virtuous circle. It also demonstrates\nthat the decisions about Risk Management are based in a cost/benefit criteria,\ndepending on the relative prices of the different options available and the\nsize of the future shock and the probability of its occurrence.As well as, the game presents the matter of the obstacles for risk management, specifically, the financial constraint.Also, it demonstrates that mismanaged risks originate severe consequences and that proactive\nrisk management is the right way for managing risks.Finally, the\ngame shows that Risk Management is a continuous process of learning and\ncorrecting, what I experienced by myself each time I played the game.The only change\nI would propose to better represent the risk management choices in the actual world\nwould be to introduce obstacles to Risk Management strategies, conformed by\ngovernment failure (lack of public resources, coordination failure, among\nothers).  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

            "reflection": "1)The game has an inbuilt system wherein one can find the\nchances if a comet is going to hit or not and what would be the severity of the\nhit. This gives the user a change to manage the risk. The user can conduct a\nresearch every time since the comet shows on the horizon. \n\nThe list on the comet gives the player an idea about the\nseverity of hit and chances of the comet hitting. This gives the player a\nchance to build a strategy in terms of research and protection . A comet having\nno chance of a hit can be avoided and the resources can be directed to the\nbuilding of pods.\n\n2)I played the game several times. In the first go I could\nnot save the pods, hence I just enumerated the mistakes I made in that turn. In\nthe subsequent turns,\n\n·        \nI researched the comet as and when it appeared\non the horizon. This gave me chance to protect my pods after the comet had hit.\nIn the first turn, I concentrated on building the pods majorly. This kept the\nticker green but a hit is all it takes. So in order to have some protection\ntime after the hit, I used the research ticker in the game. Hence in the turns I\ntook at the game, I learnt to hedge the risk by knowing the details and chances\nof a comet’s hit\n\n·        \nI bought insurance just well in advance so that\nat end if I don’t have enough resources to buy insurance I should get into any\nkind of trouble. Insurance reduces the anticipatory damages that are caused by\nthese comets. An insurance helped me a lot in subsequent turns I took. It\nreduced amount of resources needed for the rebuilding of pods. This helped me\nin keeping the ticker green.\n\n·        \nTo hedge the risk I protected my  pods by raising the level of the land.",

Además, esta herramienta permite explorar la capacidad de análisis y en la facilidad de toma de decisiones en situaciones difíciles, con la particularidad de mantener el horizonte del costo beneficio y las oportunidades de desarrollo sujetas al riesgo. El juego simula la aplicación de medidas macroeconómicas que incentivan un nivel de desarrollo tanto en infraestructura como en la comunidad en si misma, sin embargo como se ha destacado anteriormente este desarrollo esta ligado a la capacidad de resistir shocks como desastres naturales, sin incurrir en altas perdidas, en Latinoamérica  un caso especifico sin duda ha sido el caso chileno. Dentro de este contexto, conforme se ha venido analizando en este curso, la prevención y el estudio de posibles shocks permiten mitigar los efectos negativos de los shocks, esto mediante el acceso a la información, esta permite difundir los riesgos de posible desastres naturales, mediante la destinación de un porcentaje del PIB al cuidado y la prevención de zonas vulnerables a desastres naturales.A su vez, en cuanto a la prevención y disminución de los efectos negativos de los shocks naturales, si bien no existe manera de desviarlos o impedir que ocurran es factible mitigar su efecto tanto en las edificaciones como en los habitantes de las zonas afectadas. Un caso negativo que evidencia el impacto de la falta de prevención en la ultima década ha sido Haití donde un fuerte terremoto sacudió su comunidad, causando severos daños humanos, en este país la falta de planificación y prevención de los posibles desastres junto con una situación de pobreza y falta de atención de salubridad, nutrición multiplicó los efectos del desastre natural. Por otra parte, la otra cara de la moneda es visible en Chile, país altamente vulnerable a los sismos donde se vivió un terremoto mas severo al vivido en Haití, sin embargo por su cultura preventiva y por su entorno macroeconómico, este país logro superar los efectos del shock sin mayores complicaciones  lo mas importante sin mayores perdidas humanas.  Finalmente, en cuanto al juego resulta muy interesante y didáctico el poder aplicar las destrezas adquiridas en este curso con este tipo de herramientas, donde mediante una situación simulada es posible analizar el riesgo de una comunidad mantenido el horizonte del costo beneficio y la búsqueda de desarrollo sujeta a un nivel de riesgo. ",

            "reflection": "I see game as being about how decisions made impact lives,\nand shows that risk management can help lessen the effects of shocks. The aim\nseemed to be to show that you need to choose the best risk management options\nto allow for the most development. I had the best results when my focus was on\ndevelopment initially, and then added knowledge, protection and insurance as I\nhad time, although sometimes there didn’t seem to be enough time for\ndevelopment as there were too many comets. The timer had quite an impact on my\nchoices, the nearer the end of the round the more likely I was to spent\nresources on conserving what I had built up in order to hit the qualifying level.\nOverall in terms of the game, risk management slowed down development, and only\nproved its worth when a shock occurred. I think this highlights one of the\nchallenges in the real world, in that it is hard to persuade people that the\nmoney/time/resource is well spent until after a shock occurs, until that time\nthe money is in effect ‘wasted’.\n\nI played that game multiple times and changed how I played\nit to see what would happen. Seems like having cash in the bank always makes\nthings easier, from recovering after a hit to investing in knowledge, protection\nand insurance. The main things I learned were that it is easy to forget about\nrisk management (once or twice I got carried away with building the pods), that\nknowledge is very useful that it could be deemed a waste of money (for the\nshocks that had little impact or missed completely), and that the\ninfrastructure is great if you can afford it. For me level one is the hardest\nin that you are least prepared or able to handle the shocks, and I considered\nthat higher levels to be where the more developed countries are. \n\nI live in the US, and the main natural shocks are likely to\nbe related to hurricanes. From my perspective the game needs some additional\nchance factor. This would represent the different political interests in the\ndecisions that would be made in the game. Just because it seems to make sense\nto spend the money, there are other views, and in my version of the game\nsometimes just because I wanted to complete an action, I would be outvoted and\nnothing would happen.",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in\nthis game was fairly clear. The player of the game was asked to balance between\ndevelopment and the safety concerns of this virtual community. In order to pass\neach level of the game, the game asked that the players to reach a certain\nlevel of development goal. If this goal was not reached, the player lost the\ngame. Likewise, if the buildings faced damage due to falling asteroids, the\nplayers also lost the game. In terms of knowledge, the players were given the\noption to research the planet by clicking on the planet. Through this, the\nplayers were able to assess the level of damage and the probability of the\nasteroid hitting the planet. Through this, the players were able to set up a\nmethod of protection or insurance by either raising the platform that the\ncities were placed on or by purchasing insurance plans that covered parts of\nthe repair. However, protection and insurance did take a toll, meaning that it\ndid affect the rate of development. This meant that if the player played too\ncautiously and did not effectively allocate the fund, the player would not be\nable to reach the development goal in order to pass the level. \n\n \n\nI played the game twice in order\nto reach level four. For me, the second trial needed me to try and properly\nmanage the funds between protection and development. When a devastating\nasteroid was about to impact on our planet, I purchased to heavily on the\ninsurance plan in order to make sure that I will be able to cover the repair\ncost. However, this method proved to be unsuccessful by the third level as the\ngame’s difficulty increased. The high investment in insurance plans did not\nseem to be cost efficient as the impact of some asteroids resulted in no\ndamage. Also, this hindered my development process, causing me to ultimately\nlose the game. \n\n \n\nI was in charge of modifying the\ngame in order to raise the difficulty and make it seem more realistic, I would\nadd new feature, where the users need to deal with unforeseen problems of the\ndevelopment such as construction delays or natural disasters. These problems\nwill help the users fully understand the difficulty of risk management and help\nthe game be more realistic in order to help the users to be more prepared for\nreal world situations. This addition can really help to reflect the situation\nof my country, South Korea, where there have recently been frequent cases of\ndisasters such as the recent Seowol Ferry incident where many Koreans perished.\nOther incidents have happened such as Seowol, which have not only cost to\ninnocent lives, but also have claimed the national economy by slowing down\nincident related services. ",

            "reflection": "This game focussed on the role of risk management in\naverting damage and preventing setbacks. The virtual community was damaged and\nproduction lost if the appropriate risk management measures were not taken in\norder to protect against damage cause by comets. In order to protect the community, decisions were required to be made relating to trade-offs\nbetween preparing for risk and investing in the development of the community. Preparing\nfor risk involved the development of protective measures, each of which played\na vital role in the development of a sound risk framework:\n\n1.   \n‘Knowledge’ assisted in the understanding of\nshocks and the potential outcomes of a comet hit;\n\n2.   \n‘Protection’ directly assisted in reducing the\nprobability and magnitude of loss should a comet hit; and\n\n3.   \n‘Insurance’ allowed for the transfer of\nresources during good times to assist during bad times so that recovery from a\nhit was a lot easier and efficient.\n\nIn a sense, ‘knowledge’ helped before the comet hit, ‘protection’ helped during the crisis and ‘insurance’ assisted in recovery after a shock. I found that if I was\nprepared on all these three levels, I was able to easily recover immediately\nafter an adverse development.The first time I played the game, I did not place as much\nimportance on research as I did playing the second time. In focussing a little\nmore on research, I was able to more effectively protect from the comets and\nhave more time to recover from a hit. This made quite a noticeable difference\nto my overall risk management and allowed me to advance a further 2 levels\ncompared to my first try.\nOverall, the primary lesson I learnt from the game was that\nrisk management as a preventative measure is vital. Preparing communities for\ncrises before they happen and investing in what may sometimes seem ‘low pay-off\nactivities’ (such as research), can substantially help reduce damage and\nimprove recovery in adverse situations. \n\nThe game also allowed me to experience first-hand (on a\nsmall scale) certain behavioural obstacles to effective risk management. For example,\nthoughts such as “there’s a comet coming with high severity and low chances of\nhitting…I doubt it will affect me” ran through my mind during game play.  Such thoughts illustrate the tendency for\nhumans to become overly self-confident and downplay the chances/effects of\nadverse scenarios. \n\n\n\nOne simple thing I would change would be to add one other\nrisk element to the game besides the comets (e.g. add the risk of alien\ninvasion?). Whilst sometimes communities are confronted with one key risk in\ntheir region, often it is the case that they are susceptible to a risk of\nmultiple (sometimes quite large) adverse events. For example, regions in rural\nAustralia are susceptible to both flood and bushfire risk, depending on the season.\nSuch communities need to consider trade offs, not only between how much they should\ninvest in risk protection overall, but also how much to invest in protecting\nfrom each type of risk they are\nexposed to. \n\n",

            "reflection": "The entire game revolved around managing risks\nand making decisions that were pertinent to keep the development of pods going. The rationale of\nthe game was to make sure that the development reaches at a prescribed stage and in order to reach that goal choices have to be made in managing the risks which\nwere depicted as comets in the game. The resources had to be utilized in a way\nthat balanced all the major components of the game i.e the development, protection, knowledge and insurance. Striking that balance between these components and taking timely and informed decisions was the core of the game. \n\nI followed the strategy of focusing on the\ndevelopment first so that it reaches some desired level. After that the focus\nshifted to protecting the pods by the way of insurance as well as increasing\nthe height. Simultaneously care was taken in upgrading the pods to ensure the\ndevelopment is not seeing red. The research provided a lot of information that\nhelped in preparing for the strike, if the chances of hitting and severity of a\ncomet was low focus was on development and if both were high the focus shifted\nto become resilient to, as well as coping with the disaster. Also it was made\nsure that even if the severity or chances of a hit were low a certain level of\nprotection was always there as one cannot be sure of shocks.\n\nI played the game multiple times because during\ninitial trials I was not able to strike a balance between the aforementioned\ncomponents and ended up either being focused on development or protection.\nPlaying it several times helped me in analyzing where I was going wrong and\nhelped me in dealing with them in later attempts.The experience gained form the\nprevious attempts helped me in coming up with a better strategy in my last\nattempt that helped me in reaching the fifth level of the game. \n\nThe game should have definitely taken into\naccount the amount of resources that a person/community/country can afford in\nmanaging the risks they face. A choice/random assignment of curator having\nvaried amount of resources should have been allotted to bring in the effect of\nlack of resources that might hinder even the foundation work for managing the\nrisks that they might face.If asked to summarize my learning in three major points  after playing the game many times, they would be:Plan: Ad hoc development without proper research and estimation of resources can prove to be a disasterManage: Managing the resources and utilizing them to the maximum is the keyPrepare: Always be prepared for shocks, sometimes they may miss, but they would strike when least expected, so be on your toes",

            "reflection": "In this game, one never knows when a comet will appear, how many comets will appear and which one will hit. Risk management was important in the sense that it helps one to develop the city at a steady pace whilst withstanding hits with limited resources.In playing the game, I started development at a slow pace up to a point before protecting the development, purchasing insurance and researching on the comet. I then left sufficient funds to repair damages made after a comet hit.The trade off was made between pursuing new development and reserving resources to rebuild in case of a hit.If I played the game once, I would have built a little more faster than before and used more protection so that when the comet hits the damage will me minimal. The valuable lesson learnt from this game is that for every development activity that is undertaken, it is imperative to put mitigation measures in place against adverse risks that may occur. On the other hand if one is too cautious, development may be slowed down. One must develop resilience but must also push forward to make good use of opportunities.The game can be improved by giving people a wider range of options to chose from to mitigate the risk such as different types of protection and different types of knowledge gained (research)",

These tricks can be called \"planning\". I at first I hired insurance (first level of  coverage as it seems price wise fair in comparison to others) to cover possible losses and to increase speed of recovery and reconstruction. Doing the analysis on the comet help me to know when to increase the size or height of the island, so that impact could be lower on the pods. It really helped me reach the 4th level. Risk management role on that game is the base on how to move to next level, on how to prevent harmful destruction of the island and the protection of the investment made on it. Since it was of common knowledge that the island of was under the attack of comets that could destroy partially or completely the pods and the investment, it was imperative to find ways to protect it, to minimize impact ( specially when comets had high impact possibility that could be found out when researching it)  and keep funds available to finance then  a quick reconstruction of the damages. It was also clear that increasing the size of the island was not imperative, since after reaching the goal, when triggering the increase button, no power was drained, only cash. So major tasks on the game were:1 - build the pods 2 - insure the island 3 - research the comments to analyse impact 4 - maintain available cash for reconstruction of island and to invest in developing the pods 5 - increase island sideIf was to change somethings on the game, I would give more power to increasing the island height. Building solid structures, specially in terrains where the possibility of acts of God are high, is imperative, and should always come first, as the example of California and Japan where the buildings are prepared for earthquakes of enormous magnitudes.  I live in Brazil, so disasters here are not common, but floods, such as one that happened in the state of Santa Catarina a few years ago, when their plan of Emergency preparedness was Zero and no contingency plan. Insurance companies lost millions on that episode due to bad risk assessing from the government that should consider the floods, our game comets. It was a very interesting experience. ",

            "reflection": "\n\nFor me, the role of risk\nmanagement was to find the right balance between protection, research,\ninsurance and fund for development. One must keep an eye on all of the aspects\nin order to secure the safety and prosperity for his society. The main tradeoff\nthat I faced was obviously the delay in the pods development due to resource\nallocation for disaster preparedness. However I found that trough research you\ncan identify and allocate the optimal amount of money to either insurance or\nprotection. So in my second game I have paid more careful attention to research\nand then based on the facts I made my decisions where to allocate funds- to\nprotection, insurance or both.\n\nAs stated before, after my first\ngame I have tried to base my decisions on facts provided by research. This paid\noff, since I was able to allocate resources for disaster protection more\nefficiently and therefore I had more money for development of the community. In\nthe first game I also tended to neglect the comets with low severity or chance\nto hit, in some cases the comets hit my village and they rarely did damage to\nthe community, but it is a wise idea to be prepared for this little disasters\nwith insurance or, saved cash for repairs, because despite that the disaster is\nof a low severity, it causes damage and thus a delay in development. A fact,\nwhich could be easily managed and mitigated. Again, it is of crucial importance\nto find the right mix of all the variables, since if you invest in some aspect\ninefficiently this will directly affect the performance of the other elements\nin the game. The main things I learned are that a society can be self-dependent\non risk management and that decisions must be made on exact data in order to\noptimize the spending mix. Good inter society connections allow the\nparticipants to mitigate the consequences of the disaster with low or next to\nzero cost.\n\nThe one thing that I would add to\nthe game would be a fund with saved money, which must be used only to cope with\nthe consequences of a disaster. The accumulated amount can be given for\ndevelopment at the end of the next level. This will act as an insurance, but\nthe money can stay in the society and, if not used then they can contribute to\ndevelopment. \n\n",

The role\nof risk management in the game was to find the balance between the resources in\ndisposal for enveloping the infrastructure system and their costs in face of\ncoping shock’s afterwards.  It was necessary\nto combine the capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope\nafterwards. \n\nIn the\nfirst line I paid attention to the protecting measures to lay the first stone\nin the colony safety.\nThen I took construction measures and insured my buildings. Certainly it was\nvery necessary to do it time-bound and under the taking researching of comets. \n\nLike in a\nreal life the whole development of the colony was possible only in complex\ntrade-off-measures. It was very necessary to research an approximate cycle of\nplanet life to understand the cycle behavior for “predicting” the investment\nsequence. After the comet-damage the cycle began again for taking protecting and developing measures.\n \n\n2.

            "reflection": "I played the game a couple of times and interestingly got so caught up in the intellectual exercise of it that I am writing this with only a few minutes left to the deadline. It reminds me that it is important to keep in mind all the real world consequences of our decision making. As a development practitioner it is very easy to get too caught up in the intellectual exercise of \"the game\" without thinking about actual impact on lives. I'm not saying the abstract is unimportant it's just important to get that balance right. The first time I played the game I maxed out on insurance coverage every time which allowed me to develop and protect the development of the pods up to a certain point. All of my pods developed to a a level three of four until the funds for developing them further ran out. The second time I played the game I over corrected and didn't buy insurance in the early rounds preferring to rely on research and some high water protection to protect the pods. Again this worked well until a certain level when all of my pods became heavily damaged and there was not enough funds left to repair them in time to meet the development goals. The main thing that I have learned from the game is the level of complexity involved in making these simple decisions. There are only a few variables in the game at the moment and it is still complex to manage get the balance right. The other thing I learnt is that it is important to be always doing something in risk management. In spite of myself I sometimes found myself buying insurance, building up protection and then sitting back and watching to see how it all unfolds rather than remembering to  continue the research process. If I were developing a new version of the game I would try to add some sort of representation of democracy or the governance process into the mix. I'm not entirely sure how yo would do this, maybe introduce a citizen satisfaction meter which would drop if you failed to mitigate a major disaster or spent too little on development. If it dropped below a certain point you would be thrown out of office or there would be a revolution. ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk\nmanagement in the game Risk Horizon was to minimize the impact of the oncoming\nmeteors.  Several options were available,\nincluding purchasing insurance, researching and raising the level of your city.  Each of these approaches were available in\ndifferent quantities, and there is a need to balance each approach or they are\ndisproportionately expensive.  For\nexample, insurance requires an upfront payment which hinders your ability to\nupgrade your city for greater production. \nRaising your city also has problems if done excessively, it is very\nexpensive to raise the level very high in comparison to the damage wrought by\nthe far and few meteors that may get past a regularly raised city.\n\nI played the game\ntwice.  The first time, I was under the\nimpression that insurance would damage my production too severely and\nunderestimated what a significant discount repairing would be if insurance was\nbought.  As a result I only upgraded\nproduction and raised the level of my city in an attempt to avoid all incoming\nmeteors.  I was more successful when I\nbalanced the raising of the city with the insurance.  I raised the city to roughly 5 or 6 bars and\nany impact that was higher would simply have the damage repaired.  I purchased either the 33% or 50% insurance\nonly.  As a result, I approached this\nwith the equimarginal principle in mind, to reduce damage by approaching it in\ndifferent ways.\n\nIf I were asked to\nimprove this game, I believe that the “coping” or repair mechanism could be\nelaborated.  I questioned whether I should\nrepair a building when another comet was to strike soon and decided against\nit.  I think there may be a good argument\nfor people who would partially repair, knowing well that another disaster will\nstrike soon, just to return to some form of production without the expense of\nentirely repairing a building.",

One can be successful in this game if he/she can apply\nthe risk management framework to this given situation. The player should find a\nsustainable and manageable balance between building (give up some money now to\nearn more later), prevention (research, increasing protection, insurance) and\ncure (repairing). There was a serious problem that made choices and decisions\nharder: the time lag between decision and effect, also contaminated with uncertainty.\n\n\nIn the first round I\ntried to apply an old economic golden rule: specialization. I only increased\nprotection and did not pay attention to research or insurance. This old golden\nrule failed: I reached the fourth level but not the fifth. Then I changed my tactic\nand tried another one: gain knowledge, then increase protection, and if it is\nnecessary, get an insurance shortly before the shock. It was successful, I\ncould finish the game.\n\nIf I should change one\nthing my choice would be the alteration of uncertainty, I would increase it. I\nam of the opinion that the player has too much information about the shocks, I\nwouldn’t give (or make it more and faster varying in time) information about\nthe chance of hit or the severity. \n\n",

            "reflection": "It could be difficult to reach the development goal\nwithout necessary protection and planning. Three things is important e.g.\nresearch, protection and insurance. Research is important to get information\nabout upcoming disaster so that proper planning and risk management can be\ninitiated for the community. Additionally research is important to develop long\nterm strategy for example to know frequency and intensity of disaster on the\nrespective community. With this information necessary insurance can be\npurchased which can be useful for further repair and maintenance. But\ndevelopment of the community is also very important in order to build-up enough\nwealth for strengthening protection measures and insurance which ultimately\nboost up existing development initiatives. In this game I put more emphasis on\nresearch and insurance and continuous development of community (building and\nupgrading).  I played several times and\neach time I tried to impose new strategy to see how it works. Such as either\nincreasing protection or purchasing/increasing insurance premium. But the\nfollowing try I have got success when I keep the same level protection with severity\nof damages.  Also when I saw development\nbar green and approaching target, I stopped so that I would have enough wealth\nfor the next level development. Through research this was possible to reach the\ngoal. My learning is that balancing is important for a healthy development\nwhich is quite tuff but not very difficult. Another important learning is that\nto build network between community people during disaster. In that situation\nthey both can help each other and do joint effort to minimize the risk. The\nbest things I have learned is to be cautious and quick responsive to risk\navoidance and healthy development.Finally I would say this is\nvery time consuming game considering its use in study purpose but not that time\nconsuming if you understand the game. That’s means research and study on the\nspecific area, its geographical location, disaster risk forecast is crucial for\nproper planning and quick responsive measures.  One suggestion would be\nthis can be done by multiple player options so that everybody can contribute to\nexplore the solution quickly. This can also save time both for use as study\nmaterials and in practical. In my place case I would probably keeping option to\ncirculate early warning system so that community people can reach cyclone\nshelters before the cyclone attacks. This can minimize the cost for self protection measures or insurance premium. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n ",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management is to show that the risk should not be avoided, but studied. It is important to know the alternatives to adopt a strategy that allowed me to advance in levels. Maybe I should invest more in insurance,so that the reconstruction was cheaper. Preparation is key to knowing what to do when the comet is about to hit orreaches Alora: use the insurance, repair pods, raise the level of the city are some of the options we have.\nWhat I did differently the first time I played was to spend more time on research on comets, because the chance ofthe comet hitting Alora and severity decreased with it. The more information available, the better I can make my decision. It was necessary to balance time research with practical actions, such as improvements in pods and reconstruction when hit.Involve the impact of decisions on other characters in the game, like the government, neighbors, for example. Riskmanagement is also influenced by others that are in the environment. That would leave the game certainly more difficult to reach the end successfully, making it more real.",

            "reflection": "Risk management as I know it is actually planning for risk,\ninstalling features and plans, that will help cope with the vagaries of risk,\nand as I have learned from the course, is trying to use risk in one’s favour\nfor improvement and development. Also from the course, I learnt that risk need\nnot be harmful, however, and is not always a burden. In many cases, people\nhoping to improve their standards of living may voluntarily take on risk.\nIndeed, risk taking is essential to the pursuit of opportunity. But those\nopportunities may bring their own risks.\n\nThese values I gained from the Risk Horizon game I played. At\nfirst I played for a few times without passing the level 1. This gave me\nunderstanding of the important of research to evaluate the severity and\nlikelihood of the risk happen and as such cushioned my resolve and my\npreparation to forestall the impending risk. \nI understood from the game that it is often when risks are mismanaged\nthat the consequences become severe, turning into crises with dire results.\nPoor outcomes do not always reflect bad risk management, however: extremely\nlarge and unexpected shocks can overwhelm even the best preparation. Such crises\nhave damaging effects because they not only affect current living conditions\nbut also weaken their ability and willing-ness to pursue new opportunities.\n\nAlso the planning of resources to mitigate or cope with risk\nwas also a key factor that I took out from the game. For the first five times\nthat I tried the game, I was always lack of funds to plan for the comets, and\nmost times, I was hit severely with a high very high damage rate,, but over\ntime, I could spread the resources and still manage the time efficiently. This\nmade me reach level 5.\n\nA key lesson I also took away from the game is the importance\nof insurance in preparing for risk and that crises can have substantial\neconomic costs and lead to large-scale loss of property, infrastructure, and\nbe-longings. While playing the game at first, I didn’t get the importance of\nbuying insurance, until I saw that it cost me more to repair after damage.\nBuying insurance help me come back to ‘status quo’ in the shortest period, with\nless resources consumed.\n\nFrom the risk horizon game, I learnt that risk management is\nan essential tool for development because every day we are exposed to many\nrisks, and an inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals.\nThe Risk horizon game gave me hands on means to plan and manage risks, with\nmore knowledge on the importance of research, insurance, resources and\nplanning.\n\nOn a concluding note, the risk horizon game gave me scope on\nhow risk could be better used for opportunity. From the game, I learnt risk\nmanagement may provide a means both to increase economic returns and re-duce\nthe propensity for crises. This could achieve after mastering the game and\nutilizing all the available tools at my disposal to develop the pods, with less\ndamage as I progressed to higher levels.",
