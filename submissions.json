Risks (the comets) come apparently in random\nintervals and in varied speed, probability, and magnitude. The first trade-off\nfor me is to prioritize and schedule risk management - I may choose to ignore\nsome risks, to focus on single risk, or to spread my attention across multiple\nrisks. After choosing the risks to manage, I had to balance how much to time to\nspend to learn about each risk, how much resources to spend on protection, and\nwhat kind of insurance to purchase. Generally, good knowledge about a risk plus\ngood protection level eliminates the need for insurance. Insurance is helpful\nwhen risks come too quickly that there was not enough time to learn about it\nand to protect myself against it. Resources spent on risk management will delay\ndevelopment. The benefits come when we are able to cope with shocks either\nwithout loss or with minimal loss - otherwise I would have to spend significant\nresources and time to recover from losses. "

As in the game, so it is in real life. It is interesting how research reduces potential catastrophe. Also insurance is also helpful, but i thing it is better to invest in more research to do to prevent a catastrophe. Also lifting platform is also in my opinion more useful than invest in insurance, because raising platform can prevent stroke. So i think it is best to invest in basic insurance, and invest in research and lifting platforms max as possible."

By clicking on the comet and keeping its box focused on the screen, I was able to accumulate research.  Doing research on the comets will also provide knowledge on the chance of hitting and severity of potential damages.  Using the knowledge, i increased protection and purchased insurance accordingly.  Because of the accumulated research, there is more time for creating community connections.  When the falling comets hit, the damages could be reduced.  However, sometimes, there could still be some damages.  The insurance could help cover part of the cost for rebuilding the damaged pods.  "

Personally I found some of the richest strategies are:\n1.-keep your network healthy:  A healthy network is recognized way to find support in high risk environments and keep you without damage. Individuals cannot act alone. It is compulsive  concerted support and action from surrounding social and economic systems. The build of this network cannot be realized  without strong institutions and policies that focus on the long run.\n2 Knowledge and Continuous research helps: as the meteor goes down, and with several metheors and allows to distinguish between different risk levels\n3.- When the hit occurs, management activities or risk coping thanks to the insurance network.\n4 Knowledge allows prioritization: allows to Identify the types of obstacles that often impair risk management and prioritize.\n5 Recognize actions and reforms that can improve risk management and reduce the obstacles to it.\n\nFailing to follow simple preventive measures like take care when a hit is going to happend, to difficulties in mobilizing the  community to engage effectively in fragile states—  are obstacles and constraints that stand in the way of responsible and effective risk management.\n\nI often underutilize this knowledge: significant progress in risk analysis, from better forecasting to more experience and knowledge about what happens when a hit occur retrofeed my actitude to new events.\n\nIf you don't have the rightincentives,the rightinformation, or if you have behavioral issues,then it might be useless or even counterproductive to justlook atthe resource only. And that'swhy in this series of assessments ofthe obstacles, we suggest that the assessment ofthe resource issues arrives last.\n\nUncertainty is a fundamental issue with risk management, and it needs to be confronted and accepted and dealt with, not disregarded, even\nthough it might be a difficult thing to do.\n\nPolicy action: two principles to keep in mind when designing risk management strategies. \nThe first one isto be realistic, and in cases where some simple solutions can work, even though these solutions might not be the optimal ones, maybe simplicity issomething that we should follow. That is especially the case in low capacity and low‐income governments where very sophisticated policies or tools might be very difficultto implement and practice.\nThe second principle isto build foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficultto design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will\nreact and how the contextwill change.\nImplement basic policiest hat focus on what's most important, like setting  the right incentives for people to manage the risk well or making the information available, and to make sure the policies are revised overtime regularly to correct, overtime, when more information is available or when we observe that some policies might have some negative side consequences.\n\nThe impact ofthese shocks can be amplified orreduced depending on people's external environment,their internal conditions, and whatrisk management is in place. There can also be important feedback effects overtime. So,for example,the outcomes of pastshocks may affect the propensity for future shocks. I'll use an example to help illustrate some of these concepts.\n\nI think this  game is useful, particularly in how it shows how risk management can be central to the transmission of shocks and the impact that they have. The question then is: Is thaht way how does effective risk management look like?\n\nEffective risk management needs to combine capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards. \nPreparation includes knowledge, getting information on risk, but then using that information to make judgments, obtaining protection,\nmeasures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, or obtaining insurance, measures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times."

The knowledge aspect which was simulated through the research component showed the importance of doing research to gain knowledge and information on potential upcoming risks. The protection component showed the cost and financial burden that comes with protection, while lowering the probability and size of negative shocks and mitigating their impact. Lastly, the insurance plans offered reduced the cost of repair after a collision. My personal strategy was to invest in a balanced manner in all three components (knowledge, protection, insurance). Due to financial and time restraints, choices had to be made under pressure. The investments in protection can be considered as preparations for shocks; the more investments have been made, the lower the negative impact of the shock. The preparation in risk affect development paid off in every single case and showed the positive balance of risk management. Further, the game showed in a very clear way the importance to focus on all three/four aspects of risk management. If single aspects are being neglected, negative effects of shocks are overly proportional. "

This definition can simply be summarized as the preparation for risks followed by the coping with risks.\n\nThe Risk Horizon game is a clear demonstration of how an effective Risk Management strategy can help mitigate, or if possible, avoid the effects/impacts of risks.\n\nDuring the game play, my application of the methods learned from the Risk Management course played a very important role. I realized that for sustainable development to take place in my game community, I needed a good knowledge of all factors that may have a positive as well as a negative impact on my objective. The falling comets had the potential to negatively affect the development of my game community. After identifying the comets as a threat and assessing the probability of impact as well as the severity, I was able to make good decisions as to which comets had to be given priority. I had to take adequate measures to protect my game community by raising the land well above sea level. This measure costs me money, which I could have used for further development, but I also realized that it’s a lot cheaper to be proactive and put in place adequate protective measures than it is to be reactive to the occurrence of an event (comet impact). I also realized that taking out an insurance policy on my community development actually made it more resilient in that I had to pay a lot less in the event of a risk occurrence(impact) and recovery was a lot quicker.\n\nAfter playing the game a couple of times, I had to learn to keep my eyes on the Big Picture and took a broad view of my community while still carrying out all my grass root developments. I had to ensure I wasn’t too carried away by building and upgrading Pods and not looking out for the falling comets (Risks).\nIf I had the chance to make a change or add a feature to the game, I’ll put in the option of added risk protection measures with their associated effectiveness and costs. Some risk measures could be relatively inexpensive, yet quite effective."

So if you would have play with that other link, you could have realized that you had to first gain knowlege of comets, than with that information gained, for example severity of comet, you could increase protection for the community at least the same level of severity to take no damages, If that happened you had to build new pods or improve existing, which plays the role of developing since you had good risk preparation and resiliance. After you advance on every level you had to understand that as comets came faster and in more quantities, that gaves you understanding that problems may occur when you less expect them, so if your level of preparation could not match the severity you had to buy some insurance to cover the parts you could not by your own. And to recover for the very little damage caused, you had to repair first to level incomes again(coping), and then you keep improving.

            "reflection": "The\ngame that was played was really interesting in terms of risk assessment and\nprevention. The risk management was important to improve and make a better\ngrowth of the community. It was about evaluating the risk of the every asteroid\nfalling down and make some decisions regarding the actions to do to reduce the\ndamage. In this case as in life and commerce in general, the damage was not\nonly the physical damage to the buildings but the economical damage to the\ncommunity in general. Personally, when I managed to pass the level, I put a lot\nof efforts and resources in insurance and protection whilst the knowledge was\nless important to me since the alley (or the unfortunate event in general) can\nhappen at any time and the community must be ready for it, no matter the\nknowledge of the asteroids scenario  In\nfact at the beginning I was a bit to confident I could make it with a low\nprotection level. After some time I realized it was too dangerous and I had to\ntake some measures to cope with risk and damages. Having played the games a few\ntimes, I increased progressively the level of insurance and the protection, spending\nless in growth and much less in knowledge. The result was a slower but safer\nand more robust growth that could keep going for so much time. In general I\nhave learned from the game that the very first thing to do is to learn the\nrisk, the damage and the severity and the probability. It is important to know\nwhat we are facing, what we can do and what we cannot do, the protection we can\nadopt and the insurances available that can protect us and our interests. The\nsecond step is to assess the balance between the amount of money that is spent\non growth (or on investments in general) and the resources spent on safety and\nprotection. This ratio increases with the severity of the damage and the probability\nof the event. Sometimes the risk must be faced with a great investment in\nsafety, almost the same amount for the growth itself. This is the case of disaster\nwith huge impact (nuclear reactors, Wall Street servers and so on…) where we\ncannot allow any kind of doubt or possibility that a disaster might happen. If\nI were asked to develop a new version of the game and to update one thing, I would\npropose to create another kind of damage that no one can take control of. In\nlife, there are always a few things that are out of control and, no matter how\nprudent we are, they hit our life in such a way we cannot defend ourselves. In\ngeneral, this game does not foresee this kind of danger, but every business\nfaces unknown events or threats, be it a financial, structural or liquidity danger,\nthe resignation of an employee or any kind of threat we cannot defend ourselves\nagainst. In the game, even if the damage could be so hard, the probability high\nand the event frequent enough, there was always a way out of it, increasing the\nprotection and the insurance. It would be interesting to figure out a way to\ndepict a different and maybe harder scenario where some unknown events might occur\nfrom time to time and there is no knowledge, prevention and insurance against\nthem. The only way out of it might be saving some resources to start over again\nand differentiate the investments and resources. "

In fact in most cases  it results into a miss. The other factor hat helped a lot was the community, if the level of the community is a high as the severity of the strike it results into no damage. I used those two factors most of the time to get either a miss or \"no damages\" in case of the strike. The risk in this case was the asteroids strikes and by doing research on the risk, we learned more about them and this decreases the uncertainty and increased the knowledge on the risk. Community support as also important, by using the knowledge on the asteroid strikes from the research done, I was able to keep the level high enough. It is only insurance which was one of the factors I used the least. Mostly I used insurance in the beginning when it was cheap but at a high level i.e. 75% and I decreased the insurance level as it became more and more expensive. "

Not only do I have to research and learn the threats to the project, but also to protect and buy insurance for what i already built on the island. And doing all this while the main resource - TIME - is running out quickly !!\nAt first try i started to build only part of the island, because i was afraid of the risk from incoming comets and the damage they will cause. Then i understood the importance of community connections ans restarted to build with all the available money (hoping that if i run out of money i will be able to lend money from the World Bank). Then i protected the island from the invadind comets while studying the comets for better protection in the future (knowledge is power).\nThe role of risk management in the game was to balance between all the available resources: Money to build the island, research of the comets that threaten to destroy or damage what has been built, protection of the buildings and finaly buying insurance that will reduce the cost of damage because protection is never 100%. And all that with time running out quickly.\nTo prepare for good risk management you have to research and study the risks. Preparation for risk affect development  because this takes time, money and efforts - on the cost of developing the project. So one change i would propose to better represent the risk management choices in an improved game is that the comet research phase will run in parallel to the development, because in reality the research group of people is not the same as the building group and they can run in parallel time (not  in parallel money). Another change  i would propose is to give more time to play. 3 minutes is too short time to take serious decisions in a strategic game although you can repeat the game over and over again."

When it comes to the development of the community (in the game) I believe that balancing the insurance, upgrades of buildings and protection is really important, because once you get out of hands and just started focusing for example on upgrading the buildings; you can risk money, time and the development process for when a meteor comes with a strong severity when it comes in contact with your community, you will lose. So it balancing is really important to risk management, I conclude.\n(2) So basically what I learned from the game is that when it comes to community development in relation to risk management it is important that: a. I balance everything, b. Be more alert for unexpected and expected events that will come; c. Strategic planning is a must when it comes to risk management. I believe these three things that I have stated is vital in not only for the game but also for the real world when it comes to risk management. I also learned that when it comes to risk management sacrificing things is a must whether it's money, buildings etc. Sometimes sacrificing is a good thing for the development in the long run in the community. So when it comes to risk management, I believe you also have to be prepared to sacrifice things, but you should be careful and think critically on those things; will it benefit the community for the long run, or short run? or will it really benefit the community at all? \n(3) Probably if I had the opportunity to make a new version of the game that I played, I would add some agricultural businesses, health establishments and natural disaster events (floods, drought, earthquake and typhoons). I believe this new version of the game with the things I mentioned would probably be a more realistic version of our contemporary society, which can help us be more strategic and critical when it comes to risk management and developing the virtual community in the game; and the outcomes and strategies we can learn from the game, I believe, will also help us apply the things we learned in the real world."

I made the choice of continuously developing the island and this worked for a time as it helped in increasing my speed to get to the next level. The trade-offs was against increasing the level of the island. I learned earlier on to spend more time on research and this helped quite a bit.

Insurance was particularly challenging, being reasonably inexpensive at the early levels of development, but more and more expensive as higher levels of development were achieved.  This price was often foregone to focus on other areas of risk management, honing in particularly on comets with a high severity and high likelihood of striking.  Smaller comets were often deemed worth the risk of strike, particularly at higher levels of achievement of when multiple comets were threatening.   The damage from these smaller comets was easy to minimize by utilizing efficient community connections.  In fact, community connections were incredibly useful for minimizing damage after a strike they became a key (and relied upon) component of risk preparation."

Risk management was mostly centered on preventing the infrastructure from being ruined or halted from its development and dealing with the after effects of the meteors. When it came to money i was divided between construction of new buildings, improving old ones, buying insurance or some other means of risk prevention. Development was affected both in the long run and the short run, being limited to continuing on a project, fixing an old one, upgrading or starting again. Risk preparation was a limiter to continuing the project but also one that helped it continue after a meteor strike. The times I repeated the game, I built less buildings and focused mostly on research of the meteors, buying insurance and other measures to prevent a large impact on the project. Also the few buildings I made I continued to improve and upgrade them until I had enough money to build smaller and cheaper new ones. As for Risk Management in general it is a constant and never ending process, even after a project is finished. Being constantly ready to notice a possible event that will hinder the place where the project is moving forward. Not only that the stress this causes is considerable which also means that any risk manager must have a clear mind, iron will and sound judgement. It was interesting how the time researching took from the time to build and improve, even when some buildings where already finished. Which I think makes an important point on how to manage ones time when managing risk. The brings me to my second point, the tactics one chooses to create their risk management  strategy does not have to have a lot of elements in it, just a few right ones will do. Not only prioritizing resources but the measures that will prepare one for any event. If I would change the game in any way it would be in the different types of catastrophes that can affect the project, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, heavy rain ect. I would leave the same geographical location for constructing the infrastructure, also I would limit the amount of measures that can be taken after increasing the different things that can be done to prevent a catastrophe. I would expande the research tool to be used on varios factors in the game, in order to make decision making much more challenging and resource managing even  more so. Probably the thing that I would like to add but find difficult, would be human interaction as a form of risk management, like a lawsuit, an accident or shareholder disagreements. A bit complex but those are factors that arise when taking on a task, people as a a source of risk. Not to be negative but it is a real life dilema and learning how to deal with it is something that is not taught in most schools. This factor would make the game more complicated and would not make the player rely to much on the measures of probability and possibility. Relying only on numbers and equations is not enough for good risk management, they are important but relying only on them allows for tunneled vision of the environment one is in."

It also involved a tradeoff of making an upfront investment for insurance coverage versus a scenario of non coverage and paying the costs later on. Also looking at the severity and likelihood of occurrence of meteor strike (Knowledge) helped minimize the damage. The preparation in terms of buying upfront insurance helped minimize the damage of the strike. Similarly lifting the colony to level four too helped reduce the damage.

One important lesson is that committing time and resources to risk prevention is crucial for growth but that spending too many resources on them can also have a negative impact in the development of a community.

In the game, risk management helped lessen the cost and time to rebuild the community and helped prevent too many losses. Increasing protection and gaining research (knowledge) to assess the risks were priority actions I took to mitigate the possible damages/risks. Insurance was one of the main resources I used that helped lessen the cost in repairing damage, despite the cost it would take in slowing development and protection. Knowledge of the comet's severity helped assess what level of protection was needed or make preparations to cushion the estimated damage it would make. Preparation for risk, however, slowed down development as it took time to prepare the measures needed to protect the development. However, the trade off is that these preparations reduced the cost that would have further been problematic for development had they not been taken."

This is because at lower level of the island insurance costs less than\nwhen the island is elevated.  That said, early preparations and\nprotection  allow the player time to acquire knowledge through research\n(more time to focus on spinning the comet up the sky).

In terms of insurance the specific button with insurance gives us three choices of insurance with 25%, 50% and 75% protection after the loss. In terms of coping the use of repair function helps us to rebuild bildings. Development runs very slow while preparing for the risk on the other hand it is good to achieve constant development instead of repairing after loss. Preparation for risk affects immediately. In one of the level I forgot to buy insurance which made me to pay huge cost for reparing the buildings. Initially I did not study the attacking comet which caused me huge loss after the shock. Sometimes I did not pay attention to sufficient protection which made me to suffer with huge unnecessary loss.

Preparation against risks acted as a tool for Alora’s economic progress as it helped Alora to build resilience and achieve prosperity. It allowed Alora to pursue opportunities through building and upgrading plots and helped to decrease the probability of damages through research and protection. Gaining insurance also enhanced the ability of Alora to recover from these negative shocks. This led to higher development in Alora. To manage the risks, I concentrated more on protection and research and a little less on insurance. Protection level was almost at all times above five. For comets with high severity and high chances of hit, I researched a lot to create more and more time for community connections. I also opted for 25% insurance option. Gaining knowledge by researching had the opportunity cost of time and money that could have been spent to increase protection levels. Similarly, increasing protection meant foregoing the alternative of purchasing 50% insurance option. "

While I was able to complete the levels without too much concern, I was also unsure of what events necessarily improved or reduced my ability to fill the green bar by the time the clock expired.  My strategy was mainly to build up my city as quickly as possible, maximizing my stream of income, and consistently holding my ‘protection bar’ above the damage level from the average comet.  For more dangerous comets, I attempted to maximize the time available to send communication through my city.  Even for comets with little risk, I researched two to three bars to minimize the risk as much as possible.  As I was never presented with greater than three comets at a time, it was advantageous to select either the quickest moving, or most dangerous comet for initial research.  There was always sufficient time to gain knowledge, and my protection was sufficient to avoid damage.\n\nIf I were to play the game again (which likely occur after this paper is submitted), I want to test if having a smaller, more advanced city proves superior to a city which contains the maximum number of buildings, but few of which are fully upgraded.  I assume this limits the ‘communication’ aspect, making it easier to improve my ‘protection’ statistic.  Less buildings should mean quicker communication, and also less financial burden if a comet were to damage my city.  I found it interesting that I never needed to purchase insurance through the five levels I played (I received a ‘Fatal error: null’ message upon completing level 5, which froze the game for no apparent reason.)  My protection levels were sufficiently high so that by the time I had to communicate comet hits, I successfully avoided damage from each.\n\nThe change I propose, which may not be so simple, would be to add a behavioral challenge to each level.  In reality, it is a requirement for most leaders to please the people they govern.  It would be interesting to have a rating scale in which your actions affect the city’s opinion of your leadership.  If this number is sufficiently high, no issues arise.  However, if this rating scale drops below a certain point, the people could begin to reject your choices and you would fail.  Understanding that knowledge of a risk is not sufficient enough to drive a population to take measures to avoid that risk makes this behavioral challenge interesting in my mind."

I must admit it\nwasn’t that easy for me. But once I figured out how to prepare for\ncomets and how to cope with the situation once the Alora gets hit, I was able\nto develop and upgrade my pods more safely, I mean at least without trembling\nfor a catastrophic hit. I think the most fundamental choice, trade-off that one\nhad to face in every second was between taking an action for development i.e.\nbuilding a new pod, upgrading or for avoiding risk i.e. increasing long-run resilience,\nbuying insurance, observing the hits for clear information. And in this respect,\nthe color of the development meter that indicates whether I will manage to\nreach the target in given time was one of the elements that I used for\nguidance.  If the meter is yellow-like or\nworse and I feel that I’m moderately safe, I focused more on building and upgrading\nmy pods while relying heavily on research, keeping an eye constantly for the closest\ncomets. If it’s green-like or better, I made investment for long-term\nprotection. If there is an emergency and a catastrophic damage is at hand and I’m\nnot adequately resilient, I took insurance, or extended its coverage for\nrecovery. That helped really much for the compensation. Otherwise, the repairment\nexpenses became overwhelming and I failed to reach even the pre-disaster\nconditions given the limited time that I had. Since I opted for an extended\ninsurance as a last chance, compared to protection and research that I mostly preferred,\nalso more affordable when applied effectively, the benefits of insurance was also\nimmediate, similar to research in this sense. Observing and gathering\ninformation provided immediate advantages in terms of reducing uncertainty,\nreleasing the tension about what is the best to do next. The benefits of\nprotection were rather remote, but most effective I would say. I played the\ngame more than once, actually many times. The thing I learned about research is\nthat it is not enough just to click once on the comet and rely on the first\nimpression. That frequently led to underestimation of the potential damage, and\nalso misleading results for chance of hit and severity. About the long-term\nprotection, I learned that there was an average level of protection that has to\nbe maintained, given such a habitat. It was also better not to make a big payment\njust before an approaching hit. It is quite possible that you will crave for cash when the repairment is necessary. In summary, the main thing that I learned is\nhow to keep the tension between the development and measures to avoid risk at\nbalance.. "

If the comets were particularly severe, it did not make sense to further develop some pods or even create others, as the amount of protection/resources needed would out-weight the benefits of development. This however, impacted the development goal, which lead to its ultimate failure. It demonstrated that even though you may have all of the tools, knowledge, and resources available, it cannot always lead to success if the threat is too large and varied. "

Part of having insurance is taking the action even though there is risk. In real life, I think that people tend to pay for two types of insurance; those they have to have (auto, health) and those they want to have (life, renters/home) rather than those that might be useful (crop, weather, umbrella, etc.). You're never going to have perfect information in any situation, but insurance lets you keep only the amount of risk you're comfortable with while still pursing developments (or hobbies, etc.).",

If a comet did hit the ground, another goal was to learn how to cope with\nits effects by recovering from the loss using the same elements. Some of the\ntrade-offs I had to face were, for instance, giving up a higher insurance\ncoverage in exchange for more protection and more resources to build new pods,\nor having to build less pods in order to be able to afford of their insurances\nwhen they evolved since they became more expensive. So as a consequence of\nthese trade-offs, this led me to make some choices which had to do with\nreaching a balance between the deployment of knowledge, insurance and\nprotection, thus making sure these elements were available every time and that\nthey did not turn into obstacles. However this was an effective decision since\ncosts of preparation ended up being lower than costs of coping. After playing\nthe game several times, I learned that the finest way to manage risk while\nencouraging development is by identifying the resources you have and how that\nmay help you mitigate risk, making an even and moderated use of them,\nimplementing development actions gradually but strongly, thinking\nstrategically, and learning from experience to become more resilient every time\ntowards the effects of risk In contrast to this, when I had done wrong the\nfirst time I played this game was to focus right straight into the development\nwithout taking enough time to analyze hot to manage preparation so that\ndevelopment would not be hindered. Development was effected by preparation for\nrisk in times when the sever comets with high chance of hit came closer to the\nground, thus forcing me to spend great amounts of financial resources on\npreparation which did not allow me to achieve a continuous development."

During the last, winning, game, i focused more on development, while also ensuring that I am protected enough against possible risks. For instance, during this last game, I never even had to buy insurance. I simply did not need it, since my buildings were all at the latest development stage, with ground was high enough not to be damaged by the meteorite impact, and my research gave me pretty accurate information on what was to come. So, preparation for risk did affect development when i focused mainly on risk prevention. However, once I have found a balance between development and mitigation, I had no problem keeping everything in check. The lesson I can find in all this is that development cannot do without risk management and vice versa. "

It does take some time, so until new resources were generated, I came back to research of the comet, in order to gain time for making connections (this seems to be the easiest way of protection, since it doesn`t cost any resources.

I found out the hard way  that you need to heavily invest in protection as well and use insurance only as needed. Insurance almost always served as the last resort, when things were going south. What I learned and the game conveys really well is that not preparing, be it protection, insurance or research, can set you back  by a lot.

The game shows that TIME is an important factor in developmental process, the judicious use of time helps one to prepare adequately for risk which in turn helps development process.\nThe major role of risk management in the game was for one to know how to balance between developing our community and preparing for potential shocks that may arise through the development activities or naturally. In balancing this, the game points out three(3) core tools in risk management. First is the power of research,from the lesson learnt in the game, research is also part of developmental process. With adequate research one can evaluate the adverse of an incoming risk,the severity of the risk on the developmental process, and the impact of the risk on the people.When adequate research is carried out, it affords one the opportunity to create community connection even when hit by the potential shock.secondly, getting insurance from private and other organisation helps to reduce the cost of adverse potential shock on the community and hence getting insurance is an efficient and effective role of risk management.\n\n2.What i did differently the other time of playing the game was investing more time into research which affords me to create community connection when hit by severe shock.\nThe main things I learnt from the game is that TIME is an important factor in development face and investing the time wisely helps one to build a better society.And that every thing done requires finance.\n\n3.The change i will propose are:\na. Give different development option which will have different cost implication and different income stream base on cost benefit.\nb. include different potential shock like vices in the community, terrorism, flooding etc.\nc. opportunity to seek expertise outside ones community since the world is a global village."

The role of risk management in this game seemed to be preparing for the shocks that came from the comets hitting the planet, minimizing the damages that may occur, coping with what happened if they did impact the planet, and trying to avoid damaging effects. \nthere were obviously other components to the risk management strategies like  building communities before strikes in order to strengthen the community and allow for optimum growth through networking afterwards. the research component was also a large factor in managing the risk. by knowing as much about the possibility of strikes or the likelihood of it hitting were great contributing factors to not only minimizing the detrimental impact but also knowing how to prepare for example the level of insurance that may be required.\n\nAs I played the game several times there were trade off that I made in each situation. I realized that doing research was essential but not spending to much time on comets that were unlikely to hit or if they were going to have little impact. Raising the level of the village was useful only sometimes and at a certain point it no longer paid off but actually cost more to raise it for protection. Getting to much insurance left you with little money to rebuild after multiple strikes so you had to trade off the level of insurance with the needs of building and rebuilding the community.\n\n2. As I played several times I realized what each of the options gave to the player in regards to value for money spent. At first I thought insuring at a high rate which resulted in costing less to rebuild was essential but realized quickly this was not the case. Changing the levels of insurance as the levels of the game changed was much more productive to 'risk management'. Connecting the pods as quickly as it was affordable turned out to be a good strategy. Getting ample knowledge through research on the highest risk comets made me more successful gaining higher levels in the game. Knowledge is essential in managing risk.\n\n3. There were several thing I felt I learned form this exercise. Beyond learning that there were several components to be watched at all times and it was like having juggling balls in the air and if one fell or you took your eye off it the others were soon to \"crash\".\n\nOther things I learned were taking preventative measures is imperative to success in risk management. \nKnowledge is very important and by using  this strategy it can improve your ability to take action in protecting against whatever you are dealing with. Although you can't spend all your efforts and energy in \"research\" as it will take your concentration off the other important components.\nHaving the right type and correct level of  insurance can certainly help people either take more risk or recuperate from disaster. More insurance   or over insuring is not always helpful or beneficial.\nCoping ability comes from a variety of sources and there have to be sustainable methods in place to help people, communities, societies and countries survive. Coping is strengthened by the bonds that people have with others\n\nIn closing I found this game to be frustrating and challenging but very effective and invigorating as a  learning tool. It certainly illustrated the concepts of the readings and lectures in the course work in a very interactive way. I spent considerable time getting to the level I did and then trying to better my 'score' and hopefully learning more about the need of all the components of risk management and what it takes to be successful.\n"

In a resource limited settings one has to make tradeoffs in terms of which risk preparation and protection measures to take, while at the same time ensuring that they do not take more risk than they can handle or fail to exploit opportunities because these may come with risks."

The game offered a scenario where we build to prosper but there are challenges thrown in the way. The value that we may loose\nfrom the impact was not given (as in number), but understood when there was an impact as we lose pods (property). In the game, the most important value that risk management gave, in my point of view, is that to choose the trade off among the risk management\noption. Some options are very effective but can be very expensive in terms of money or time. Main trade offs were among the time and money. I would put more efforts in insurance. Here to me insurance is important as I am protecting financial value. Knowledge\nis also important but sometimes the risk (meteor) came so fast, time to gather knowledge was not available. I did invest too much time on knowledge gathering. I would still do but I will do that if I see that very few risks are coming and I have time.\nI would rather invest in insurance and keep upgrading it. Time is also very important. Decision timing helps to take effective decision. If I have less time, it is better I save the value at risk (financial, life etc.). I would bring the value at risk\nin the decision making. For example, if the severity of impact is high, the value at risk (100% of 3 pods = 600) should be shown in the option. It could have been put like one chart saying this option costs this but saves that much etc. We cannot put\nnumber for human life. But when decision makers needs to take decision or they face trade off or they have develop policy, they need to know how much or what is at stake. This may not be applicable for life or education, but when we see property being\ndamaged, putting number on an item can help taking decision."

Minimal insurance provided a good coverage for the cost, compared to no coverage, but higher insurance was costly. I could rarely afford the highest insurance package at the start of the level and by the end of the level, there were few meteorites left and it would not have been worth it. As for research, in many cases the first estimate was usually close enough for me to prepare the adequate protection. There was definitely a case of diminishing returns for research and since it took the entire screen, it prevented me from doing other actions like building or upgrading. Also, research had no impact on say the probability of a hit. Whether or not you knew the meteorite was going to hit, it could still hit or miss. Being prepared was a better solution and less costly than coping by repairing the buildings, even with insurance.\n \nAt first, while playing Risk Horizon, I found myself using a lot of risk-mitigating tools that sometimes hindered development. It took a while for me to strike a balance, but after playing the game multiple times, I was able to reach level 5 with a good balance. I learned that you must pay attention as much to global development than to punctual events like a disaster.\n \nI would add the notion of opportunity to the game, perhaps in the form of technological improvement. This could be another form of research and knowledge. The more is invested in this type of research, the lower the intensity and lower the probability of a hit. In addition, this type of research could itself be a driver of development since it fosters employment, unlike insurance. Concretely, this could be making buildings more resistant."

            "reflection": "1.  The role of risk management is important in the game. This is because the aim of the game is to build up pods on a barren unpopulated island. However, the island is continuously subjected to the threat of comets. When the comets strike and hit on the island, the pods built will be damaged and the island will be scorched and turned uninhabitable.  \n\nSo, ways must be thought out to build pods on the island on the one hand and protecting the buildings from the threat and damage done by the comets. Ways of protection will involve risk management.           \n\nThe risk management involves a few basic steps and requirements. \n\nThe first step is to do some research on the comets in the sky.  The power to look out into space and learn the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet will give some idea to the player whether to neglect the comet (with little chance of hitting) or step up protection for the comet (with high chance of hitting). Also, the longer you do the research on the comet, the higher chance for you to mitigate the effects of the hit after the comet strikes on the island. \n\nThe second step is to do protection. If the slider on the bottom right of the screen is pressed and held into the upright position to raise your island. By matching the level of protection with the severity of the comet, one will prevent one’s pods from being damaged!\n\nThe final step available is to obtain insurance for the pods built. The insurance policy must be carefully selected so that the smallest premium spent can offer enough protection against the comets striking.\n\nHowever, the preparation for risk will affect the development. When you do the research on the comet, the development will be halted. When you uplift the slider on the bottom right, the development cannot take place at the same time.\n\nAlso, when money is spent on insurance, less money will be spent on the development. \n\n\n2.  If I play the game more than once, I shall do something differently in the second time. In order to achieve optimum progress and wealth on hand, I shall research every comet and neglect those comets with less likely impact possibilities. I shall only raise the insurance coverage had I been sure the coming comet will cause a disaster. Also, I shall raise the slider to raise the energy level to mitigate the impact of the hitting comet. However, I shall upgrade the pods whenever possible.\n\nThe main things are the balance of the risk and protection. In order to obtain the optimum result, one must balance the resources on hand and sometimes moderate risks have to be taken. \n\nAlso, I learnt from the game that time management is important. This is because each game has only 3 minutes and time must be utilized wisely to build up the community and to mitigate any impending and afterwards loss. \n\n3.  This game requires a delicate balance between the various available options in order to build a healthy community. However, if I were to change the game, I shall do replace the “comet” with “typhoon”. Typhoons come every summer to my part of the world and if the impact is direct, much disaster will result on the land area. The research on the “typhoon” will be similar to that of the “comet”.\nThere is one more thing I would add is the option to construct/enhance city drainage in order to mitigate the flooding brought by the typhoons.\n"

These are of course the various aspects of risk management. Diverting some resources from development toward protection led to a decrease in the growth in the short-term, but the benefits were obvious in the aftermath of a disaster. Lesser damage to protected structures allowed for faster and cheaper repairs, allowing the rate of development to return to normal quickly. Purchasing insurance presents a similar trade-off. Premiums appear prohibitively large when there are no hazards on the radar, but having insurance pay out repair costs after an event is very helpful."

If the attack is of higher density then the research work has to be higher along with the protection. If you are hit severely by the attack  and you don't have the risk cover then it will not only have a cost but will also take greater amount of time.The learning's were devoting greater time on research if the attack is of higher density and insurance cover should be larger once your community development level has reached a good level, say Level 3 or more. I played the game twice and these were the learning's. The game needs the player to create a proper balance between all the three things insurance, protection (leveling up) and the research. The attacks were of the similar domain and there should have been different attacks as well exposing to different types of risks. "

While managing the growth of Alora, I tried to establish the town to its full size in level 1 and while doing, researched the comets. Good side about researching is it doesn’t stop your development unlike protection which enabled me to reach to the required level way before the time stopped.  However, starting from level 2, I had to both spend money on insurance (75%) and protection. No matter what, the town strongly depended on insurance more than protection to continue developing. Again, I reached the cap before the stopwatch. In levels 3 and 4, I followed the same pattern with 75% insurance and unlike some comets hitting it, none were able to damage the town.\n\nInsurance always saved my life and minimized amount of protection to the level where I hardly depended on it let me continue to the game with a decent flow of cash while researching the comets and enjoying the growth of the town. In level 5, I thought I was spending too much money on insurance as nothing had been able to damage the town before and I wanted to make a difference and bought an insurance plan of 50% and wanted to concentrate more on the growth of the town as I wanted to grow even faster than before. Well, that ended my growth as one comet hit the town hard and hindered my growth for good. It was too late to raise the protection to the right amount when it hit the town despite the amount of time spent on research it. So the end came.\n\nAlthough I didn’t mention how I played the game in the first trial, I played the game 2 times and reached to level 5 at most. In the first trial, I worked more on the protection and minimized the amount of insurance and couldn’t even reach level 3. On the second try, I did the vice versa and reached level 5. I understood that even though personal protection is important and should be done, private help from the state/government/communities in means of insurance is a must to deal with large shocks and help the community to look to the future for continual growth in the game.\n\nIf I were to change one thing, I wouldn’t decrease the importance of protection that much. Protection shouldn’t change the level meter to red. It’s understandable that protection decreases the growth rate but so does insurance by spending money on something rather the growth. By spending on protection, by raising the hill, you, in a way, are opening up canals that would bring water which are need for the growth of crops as well as your town. The game, from my point of view, was underlining the importance of insurance more than the required amount. It is clear that insurance is important but I, kind of, came to realize that this game was all about the huge importance of insurance while paying little to nothing to personal protection. By balancing this scale between protection and insurance better, it would be more realistic for the game to capture the importance of insurance."

Not always it´s like that, in the game I learned the chaos can happen in seconds. This game remembered me the interlinked components of risk management: Insurance, knoledge, coping and protection. Why? Because when we are dealing with the risk is important to considerer to act in time to avoid or dismiss the damage, also the economic resources must have administrate with accuracy. The game showed me that I need to transfer resources across people\nand over time, from good to bad states of nature, understand shocks, internal and external conditions, and potential\noutcomes, thus reducing uncertainty, recover from losses and make the most of benefits, reduce the probability and\nsize of losses and increase those of benefits to cover the population can be affected for the catastrophe. Also considering what risk management entails: that is, preparing for and coping with both adverse and positive events (Shock, external environment, Internal conditions and outcomes). Risks are costly, but so are the measures required to better prepare\nfor risks. After we apply the strategic actions and check if there are damages or impacts with people. There the game teach me the education about the risk management is fundamental  because if we know the appropriate steps to act, we only have minor impacts and we do not have to spend more money because we invested previously. social and economic systems help people’s risk management the state’s role goes beyond the narrow purpose of correcting market failures and extends to addressing systemic risks, building institutions that enhance  each component of risk management, and providing direct support to vulnerable populations. The international community can help governments\nand countries that lack resources and capacity for risk management, because the impact of damages affect to all of us and our property, induvidual, community and worldwide. When we prevent in long term we have benefits not only in our purse or pocket, we can use the money in other activities like research or community business. We have the correct training in risk we can construct additional knowledge for individuals and future generations. The media and other communications tools help us to learn and teach to others to have prevented behavior.  Finally the game was fun and interactive way to learn the basic tools in risk management."

Finally, insurance is something you prefer to have and\nnot using, rather than needing but not having, just like condoms.\nInsurance would be paying less money over a long period on time,\nrather than paying a huge amount of money in case something bad\nhappens. On this game, what I normally did was to keep an eye on\nevery meteor to evaluate whether would impact earth or not. This was\na recursive action.

Insurance was a most, it was the first thing\nI did every time I overcome a level. I reached level 3 because time\nbit me very often, I could not figure out the way to keep growing on\ntime, I would say meteors weakened even though I increased the height\nof the lands and kept creating new homes. If I had the chance to\nsuggest another item on risk management behavior, I would add a sort\nof a “bank deposit” in which I had the chance to pass some money\ninto this account, increasing over time (lets say a minute) referring\nto a “opportunity cost”, which at the end I would have more money\nto repair any damage or build/upgrade more homes.

In the game ,the job is to establish a community on a planet by building pods. Every time you build a pod some amount of cash is to be spent on the building process. Each time you establish a new pod ,the development bar on the left of the screen shows a progress in it. A facility of upgrading of the pods is also made available for the gamer. Now there is provided some twist in to the game, The colony is surrounded by water and falling asteroids. Each time an asteroid hit the water surface, a wave is generated causing damage to the already establish pods. To prevent the pods from getting destroyed several solutions are provided in the game. First solution is the insurance, that will help to cover the damage caused to the pods. It also helps to cover the loss in the development bar on the left at minimal cost. The second solution is protection, by lifting the area surrounding the pod using the button on the right most corner of the screen. By dragging the button in the upward direction the area can be lift up into  the air. The third solution is the research, in which a close watch on the trajectory of the asteroid is made to predict the chances of getting hit by that asteroid. Based on this research, insurance claims can be easily made. Also with an appropriate research use of protection technique can be efficiently be made.  The role of Risk management in the game was to identify the risk or possibility of getting hit by a asteroid. It also includes calculating the amount of impact being generated on hitting by that very asteroid. The choices that i made includes doing some research on the trajectory and impact of an asteroid. Based on that research insurance option is being taken by me and in the end appropriate protection plan or level is being taken to mitigate the after effect or damage caused by that asteroid. The things that i will do differently after the first time is to spend most of my time in research process so as to claim my insurance money on damaged pods.The research also helps me in establishing an appropriate protection percentage level. The newer version should be developed providing the facility of changing the protection level and the positions of the pod to easily cope with the damages caused by asteroids.  The changes that i would propose to better represent the risk management choices should include proper research facility to identify the upcoming risk and to generate proper risk mitigation strategies."

In order to manfe teh risk I neede to recognize how aprtucular decisions were imopacting the outcome - therefore I sterted to make an insurance at the lowest level, then increased to the highest. LAso it was necessary to test an impact of protection and the knowledge - trsying to identify a difference between : before protection and with protection. Knowledge management process was the latest which was tested.    \nSo,  a proper  preparation to risk in the second session did let to manage the game more effectively with better scoring.

Alternatively, if you played the game more than once #\n\nPlaying a second time - the conclusion was that I needed to spend mopre time on preparation in order to undesrtand all implications - and interrelations.

Preparation for risk affects\ndevelopment after some time because coming comets caused damage when the island\nwasn’t protected enough. When you use too much resources for protection or too\nmuch time for research there is lack of resources for developing pods. I considered\nthat when attempting to balance preparing for comets and developing island by\nbuilding and upgrading pods.   "

Development needs resources, resources need technology and technology needs research. A community struggling for its setup can not think of investing in research areas because of its high costs and complexity. Investment in Research arena is a huge challenge and is full of risk. After crossing through this start up phase, resources can be pooled accordingly and then be invested in the research area. In the context of the game,a balance was needed between the growth in the development percentage and the level of the ground barrier( symbolizing technology) to be raised. Moreover, Research was also important because it helped the community to tackle and cope up with the losses. The more time the community spent on this area, the better information it had accumulated. Plus, preparedness through research also enabled the community to spare some time towards better communication and faster rehabilitation. An area to be focused by any developing community is the importance of having a good communication network. An Adhoc Network must be set up in every disaster prone area to have an emergency contact with the habitats. Sometimes this emergency network can prove to be life saving medium of communication post a disaster. Survivors can help each other during these crises time so that losses can be minimized. During a disaster, their is a huge loss of life and property. Life losses can not be prevented, but after shocks due to loss of property can be minimized. One of the effective way is to undertake a better insurance policy which will help to cope up with the losses in minimum costs and investment. Insurance provides a back bone and courage to actually adopt risk for a better opportunity. An insured person can undertake more work and can utilize resources in a better manner. One hard truth that nature displays is that the time and resources that have to be utilized for the development scheme,some of them have to be used for preparedness against any disaster. That results in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, rather slowed down, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I had reserved some resources for research and preparedness. Most importantly, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. Sometimes, after shocks of a disaster leave a long lasting effect on the life of the effected people.The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community. "

When your base is impact resistant, and you\nhave insurance and a research center, you have a stability condition.

Initially it is necessary to develop, in order to increase income, while at the same time deciding whether to insure or protect the pods from damage from the meteors. The damage from the meteors can also be reduced by researching them. If development occurs to quickly their is not enough protection for the pods due to lack of resources. However, if to much protection is provided, there is not enough time to gain knowledge about the meteors. Further, if the damage from meteors is only insured, the time taken to repair the pods greatly decrease the time available for development. By preparing for the risk, time was not required to repair the pods, more resources were available to develop the pods, and in the case of protection very little damage occurs to the pods."

The role of risk management allows keeping the community flourish and putting support network in case of any disaster. There were many type of disaster occurrence some at high impact and some with little impact. \nThe tradeoff between the coverage and protection allows a good risk manager to choose the best possible option. Risk management allows planning and strategizing the long-term future for the newly created community. \n\nWhat choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?\n\nThe balance between the multiple choices was quite difficult. However, with the information on resources and cash in-hand allows to do the trade-offs. The knowledge on in-coming risk had provided support to protect while raising the ground 40% and give 60% towards insuring the assets. The other option to increase the strength of houses been used as an alternate strategy in risk management.\n\nIn what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe recovery was swiftly handle accordingly with insurance coverage. The strong structure of the upgraded building enabled to re-build and update the damage impact. The increase frequency of disaster were handle promptly as recovery time was shorten with more resources on ground. The communication networks also contribute due to the closely built housing with-in the community. However using multiple level upgrades near the housing circles also reduced the impact.\n\n2 -If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?\n\nI selected between raising the ground and paying the insurance coverage. The repetitive game playing allowed me to be precise in balancing between both options. Furthermore, investing in upgrading the building infrastructure is also very crucial role to handle disasters. Overall three type of support available during the game and they are categorize as follows:\n\n1-\tPre-disaster approach -Upgrading the building structure and buying the insurance coverage\n2-\tDuring the Incident - raising the ground to higher levels\n3-\tPost event recovery – rebuilt and recover losses through insurance payments\n\nI learned that proper planning with a better knowledge of incoming events could provide fruitful future for the community. The awareness and publicity campaign must well planned as people have short memories of the past events. The trade-off between long-term and short-term objectives brought up-front with the community to build consensus. Handling natural disaster requires joint effort from neighbors and external organizations.\n\n3 - The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nI will select to show the past trends about the events happened, the dashboard will clearly show the frequency chart along with calculated impact on resources spend. The dashboard approach will be active to send alert and updates to the player. The prediction mechanism will work to generate upcoming events and with recommendation approach to balance between the available support and protection. Timeline dimension will provide strong capability to enforce strategically for the future incidents.\n\nA recommendation dashboard to protect for the future risk will be fun thing to have. Dashboard with multiple gauges and dialer showing temperature, pressures, season of the year.\n\n"

I at first only built 2 or 3 pods and always buy the insurance of 50-75% coverage. After that, I built protection and when the shock came, I did research based on the severity and the chance of hit. If the shock with higher severity and large chance of hit, I did the research as longer as possible. I also considered the speed of the shock. The faster the speed was, the faster I did the research. If I had more money left, I will develop the pods and built the new one. I finished my game at level 5 and until level 5, I have not yet used all the spots. But at level 5, I delayed insurance purchase, since I thought doing good research is a good substitute for the insurance. Actually, I never used insurance in the game. "

It is made evident that knowledge about comets, their impact and chance of hitting was essential to keep on developing towards the needed score. Knowledge of comets made it possible to prepare for its impact accordingly. Whenever there was a moderate chance of hitting or moderate damage, I would invest money on protection for two reasons; one reason is that protection level stays the same in case the comet misses, so any money invested in protection will be used in the future and second reason is that even if the meteor hits, the impact will be less and only one level of security is lost. However, when the severity of the crush impact was high I would invest on high insurance since investing money on protection might not be as effective as the 75% return of insurance.\nI played the game twice, so the second time I did some things differently. First of all, I always made sure to have enough money for the highest level of insurance. Even if i had money to upgrade my land or higher the protection level, I would keep the minimum insurance money in case there was a comet with high severity that would make a crush unavoidable. Then I would buy an insurance to protect my income. Secondly, I would try to upgrade my water producers as soon as possible instead of building new small ones, in case of a comet hit I would only have to repair a few. The main things I learned from the game is that there must be a balance between money invested for growth, protection and insurance. Overspending money on insurance that I could avoid by just raising my protection level was a valuable lesson. Another important lesson was that sometimes it is acceptable to take some damage on insured property than overprotecting.\nIf I was to make a new version of the game, I would definitely add the option of \"black swan\". A Black swan is an unavoidable event that could not be predicted. Knowledge of comets is fine but sometimes knowledge cannot cover everything. For example, say that we research a comet and it's impact is low and chance of hitting is low, so one does not buy insurance and invests on protection. Then it turns out that the impact of the comet was far greater that no one could predict because knowledge has its limits. Then the consequences would be severe and our income will suffer great loss. I think that option would make \"gamers\" a bit more alert and to keep in mind that not everything can be controlled but being always prepared can mitigate the effects of a disaster."

Building puds, buying insurance and also increasing the level of your community when playing the game are strategies which does not only prevent your community from disasters but in present a situation in which can simply recover from it if its occur. for instance, if you buy insurance when playing the game, in instances when you are hit you can easily use the insurance you bought to help you recover for from the hit.

The choice between these actions depends in part on how the (certain) costs of preparing for risk\ncompare to the (often uncertain) benefits of doing so.12 In addition, risk management requires considering different risks and the relative need of preparing for each of them (box 2). Given limited resources, setting priorities and making choices is both\nunavoidable and necessary. For instance, a family living in a violence-ridden community faces safety, health, and property risks and must choose how to allocate its limited budget to protect and insure against each of these risks. Likewise, a small country\nprone to torrential rains and also exposed to international financial shocks must decide how much to spend in flood prevention infrastructure and how much to save to counteract the effects of financial volatility. When risks are taken on voluntarily in\nthe pursuit of opportunity, another trade-off emerges: expected returns must be weighed against the potential losses of a course of action. This trade-off is intensified when a higher return is possible only if more risk is accepted. That is often the\ncase with financial investments, where a lower yield is characteristic of a more secure position, and higher yields with riskier positions. 13 A risk-return trade-off may also be perceived for certain development actions: for instance, public opinion\nand certain experts may link the pursuit of higher economic growth with lower environmental protection or higher inequality.14 Although this and other risk-return trade-offs may not be present, risk management entails addressing them as a legitimate possibility.\nRisk management involves not only considering trade-offs but also taking synergies into account. These can make both preparation for and consequences of risk less costly. They can also diminish risks and increase expected benefits. These “winwin situations\nare widespread and should be emphasized— which is not to say that they are costless or always easy to implement. Investments in nutrition and preventive health, for example, make people more productive while reducing their vulnerability to disease.15\nSimilarly, improvements in the business environment, such as streamlining regulations and improving access to credit, can induce the enterprise sector to become more dynamic and grow more quickly, while also making it more resilient to negative shocks.\nThis is all from my side.

Knowledge about the risks, protection against the risks and getting insured against the risks are important tools for risk management. Here, the chances of damage due to hit of a comet was a major risk hampering the development. Another important risk was flooding. Investment in the research to increase the knowledge about the comet helped in reducing the risk of hit with the help of timely development of protection measures. It does costed but helped in reducing the damage. Getting insured prior to the risk emergence helped in reducing further the damage due to the risk. The delay in research, protection or getting insurance leads to higher damage due to poor risk management. Timely investment in research and development of protection measures reduces the damage due to the risk and also reduces the time wasted in the aftershock after the occurrence of risk. I was not able to move quickly due to technical problems and so the damage was higher as I could not take timely measures.   \n\n2. I played the game more than once. However, due to technical problem with the computer I could not take quick actions and so the damage was more and could not reach the level 2. However I learnt that you have to identify the risks in advance and get insured prior to the risk happens and continuously invest in the research about the risk for increasing the knowledge for taking protective measures. It does reduced the damage in next games but at the same time it also affects the development and makes it slow. In the next trials, I started investing early in reserach for increasing the knowledge, using the protection measures to reduce the impact and inveting in insurance earlier for the risk which were likely to cause damage and leaving uninsured the risks which were less likely to cause the damage.\n\n3.\tThe game is very interesting and helping to learn with fun and experience and so will be having long term impact on the knowledge and memory. It covers the important aspects of risk management such as prior knowledge about the risks, investment in development of protection measures for protecting from risk and investing in the insurance against the risk. The game explains about the risk mitigation measures, the importance of their timeliness and quantity in which they have to be taken and what are the factors that hamper or delay the development process. Flood and earthquake are important risks causing damage to the development process in our areas. So I would like to add some measures for reducing the risks due to these risks. for example information about the rainfall and likely inflow of the water shall help in advance to take prevetive and protective actions so that the damage to the life and property can be reduced to the minimum. The game needs some smooth software platform so that the technical problems can be less  and the game can be played for learning an important topic by all including those having lower version of software and hardwares.\n"

First of all you had to be prepared for the comets because they may come in full speed and if you were not prepared they may hit your pods. You should be prepared in many ways, even if you are prepared for an imminent danger, in our case the comet, as it approached the pods it may change its characteristics (the severity, the chance to hit the pods), and for this reason a good research is always essential, as also in the game, this teach us that no matter how much measures have we take there is always a chance that things may go wrong, or in the other way you may take all the appropriate secure measures and in the end not to use any. In the game there was given also the chance to buy an insurance, although it is costly most of the times at the end it will be proven useful because as I mention above the parameters of the imminent danger may change and we should not be overconfident.\nI played the game twice, what I did differently in the second time was the research of the comments. In the first time I checked them once and wait to hit, in the second time I was checking upon then in order to notice any changes that was proven to be correct. Also I bought a 75% insurance that also proven to be useful. Although the game may seem very simple and childish, the impact for the fundamental principles of the effective risk management was very serious. \nI think that if I was asked to develop a new version of the game I would add the human factor. Now a potential damage only destroyed the pods, in real life on the other hand there are always human losses and casualties; this may lead us taking the risk management more seriously. Even if we think that the measures taken for effective risk management are costly, the repairing of the damages always cost more. Additionally we have to bear in mind that if the people in a community, city, country feel secure in it, usually they try to do more and contribute more so these places are usually lucrative, which can makes us see the risk management also as an investment.\nIn my place, I believe the most important thing that needs to be done in my opinion is to proper inform people about their obligation to implement the risk management in their everyday lives.  \n"

At certain times, we must act immediately and protect ourselves with no insurance. long term point of view ' research always proved to create benefit. The is, following the comet was almost always beneficial for me. Insurance, when likelihood of damage was high, proved to be beneficial as well, as the repair cost was very low. Development must be done with care due to the fact that it is costly and may be expensive to repair in cases of disaster and comet hits. However, it is recommended to have an insurance for disaster when there is a well developed community. Natural disasters may be fatal to the community if not insured."

This,\nhowever, came with a lot of dilemmas and trade offs. Firstly, involving myself\nin protecting the community against potential danger costed me the valuable\ntime that could have been spent in making or upgrading pods that would\ncontribute to development. Every time a comet struck, I was pushed certain\nlevels down on protection. But it still proved to be the most effective measure\nof avoiding damage. Secondly, research was a significant help in order to gain\ntime to make community connections. For comets with high chances of hit and\nseverity higher than the protection I had offered, research was imperative for\ndamage control. However, with a lot of comets approaching simultaneously, I had\nto choose to research only about those that had high severity and chances of\nhits. Thirdly, the insurance cost a lot of money which could otherwise have\nbeen spent on protection and building/upgrading. It also proved to be futile at\ntimes because due to adequate research and protection mechanisms the pods faced\nno damage at all, thereby wasting the money spent on insurance.

A country needs to be well protected from any sort of natural disasters and this can only be protected by means of insurance. A timely insurance covers the entire risk at the time of natural calamnities and disasters. There may be tidal waves, earthquakes, floods due to heavy and incessant rain , destruction by fire and other uncertain circumstances. Protection from uncertain risks is a bare necessity. A country needs to take enough protection for the safety of the environment after taking into account the climatic condition and the suitable environment that needs to be present in all respects. A country needs to change from the point of climate, economy and financial strength to overcome all the risk and difficulties  that may come on the way. In this respect it is insurance that plays a vital role in protecting the country from natural disasters .The insurance company assesses the weight of such disasters and protects by way of compensations. Until the risk is covered fully by way of insurance whatever the loss may have incurred will be made good by the insurance company. It only needs a timely assessment of the loss suffered and made good the loss so as to bring peace to the community and the world at large. Risk management thus needs much importance for facing unforeseen difficulties that may come in the way. It is also important to say that risk management indeed is very helpful and advantageous if it can be rightly handled at the right time and at the right situation. One has to understand and study the density of the situation that may arise due to the natural disaster and that too without fear. It is the independent decision of the experts who are engaged and specialised in world disasters and who can easily predict as to when and where such natural calamnities may occur, To overcome such risks , it needs to gather knowledge in a much wider scale, it needs to be well protected to ensure that such natural disasters may not arise in future and it needs to be well insured to the fullest so that any sort of natural disasters that may occur may be covered and compensated with proper assessment at the right time and at the right place. A country's prosperity depends much more on the efficient risk management which is the need of the hour. A close watch and good observance is needed to see that a country is well protected from any risk that may come on the way. .Insurance plays an important role in determining how much loss has or may have incurred when there is every probability of compensating the loss so that the good may be restored in due course of time. Thus, in the light of the above discussion, I come to a conclusion that it is knowledge, protection and insurance that plays a very important role in fighting out the risk and disaster  that may or may not arise. If there is no such natural risks and disasters, the country is saved but if it does occur, it needs immediate protection by way of insurance at the right time for the benefit of the community as a whole and the world at large .It is insurance that will give full protection from such risk and compensate in due course ."

I will start with the first question, regarding the role of risk management in the game. To do this, I will first provide a short description of the game. The game consists on an area where the player can build a limited number of pods that will become a community. Those pods are the wealth pools, the goal is to reach a certain amount of wealth. Comets can sometimes be seen in the sky, and if they hit, they can cause damage to the community, they reduce wealth and the damage has to be repaired, which also costs. The game has some tools, like an insurance, that can cover part of the damage, and also prevention that can meet the predicted severity of the impact. As for the meteors themselves, once they can be seem, you can check how sever its impact can be and how likely it is to hit. If a comet hits, you have sometime, limited by how much you researched the comet, to build links between individual members of the community, and these reduce the damage level. "

I think this would be very innovative based on the concept of integrating multiple actors – a holistic approach- for successful risk management \n2.\tWeaknesses:\n•\tI think you did not directly address the question of “In what ways did preparation for risk affect development” in question number 1\n•\tRegarding the questions of lessons learnt from the game under question number 2, it would have been better to show the lesson learnt, based on your tries, regarding the process of managing risk. \nIn summary, I really appreciated your reflection that you have really understood the message that the game tries to convey.

Each pod has a cost to build, and as these pods are built, the initial sum is reduced by the cost of the built pod.  While pod building, comets appear in the sky, headed for the island.  To win the game, the player needs to build pods to a designated value and protect the built pods from losing value below this needed value. Pod value is reduced by damage done by colliding comets.  The player has 2 and 1/2 minutes to achieve the need value.\n\nEach comet, as it appears in the sky, has knowledge associated with it.  This knowledge includes the damage severity to the pods if the comet collides with the island and the chance of comet collision.  The player needs to use this knowledge to decide on options the player has to minimize the damage that a collided comet will have on the built pods.\n\nThe options to minimize the damage to the pods from the comets are to obtain protection and/or to obtain insurance.  The player can obtain protection, but to do so requires time.  Time is important because the game lasts only 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Obtaining protection requires substantial time that could otherwise be used to build pods.   In order to win the game, the total value of the pods built needs to reach a designated level within the 2 and 1/2 minutes.\n\nHowever, increasing the pod-built total value takes time.  So, there is a time-used tradeoff between building pods and obtaining protection.  Obtaining too much protection might mean not leave enough time building pods to reach the required pod-built value.  Not enough time building protection increases the potential damage to the built pods when a comet collides with the island.\n\nThe knowledge provided to the player on each comet is crucial in deciding how much protection should be obtained. The knowledge includes the damage severity on the built pods if the comet hits the island and the chance of island collision by the comet.  This knowledge is a guide to the player on how much time to build up protection – the higher the severity and the collision chance – the more protection (and time) needed.\n\nShould a collision seem likely, and if the player believes that protection may be insufficient to minimize the pod damage on collision, the player can buy insurance, using up some of the funds and time otherwise needed to build pods.  The purchased insurance, however, will reduce the severity of the pod damage from the colliding comet and protect some of the value of the pods.\n\nThe strategy I would use, and eventually did use, after playing the game initially, would be to obtain sufficient protection where comets with high damage severity and collision chance appear.  \n\nA key point learned is to quickly obtain knowledge on each comet and to be concerned about those comets that have high severity damage and collision chance.\n\nIn a new version of the game, I would put more emphasis on being able to reduce the chance of collision as I acquired more knowledge about the risk (the comet).  This new aspect to the game models well actual conditions where more knowledge often helps prevent the risk (the collision) from taking place.\n\n"

Each level of action (knowledge, protection and insurance) brought in different advantages and disadvantages. Although insurance is useful and my first thought was to get the best insurance out there, it did not help me in the short term, instead it just depleted my funds unecessarily based on the approaching risk. What I learnt then is a minimum insurance is necessary, but medium to high is unecessary if you have other measures like protection and knowledge working together. Knowledge or research as its called in the game, was useful to minimise the risk, the more knowledge one had of the impending comet, the better prepared and hence reduces the severity and likelihood of critical hits by the comet. Furthermore, if ample research has been conducted before the comet hits, there is likelihood to prepare and educate the inhabitants about the comet beforehand but also repairing the damage once the comet hit. The element of \"community\" where the villagers stay connected to each other helped with reducing loss from the damage caused by the comet. However, spending too much time on research was also detrimental if the knowledge learnt is not being used to develop or build the properties and upgrade them at the same time. With regards to the protection element in the game,raising the level of protection based on the severity of the incoming comet, did help to a certain extent because it increased the likelihood of \"misses\" by the comet but also the severity of impact.

Risk management consisted of protecting the pods from being damaged by comets(risks) and in case of a hit repairing the pods. The choices involved spending money on developing and upgrading the pods, researching the comets to gain knowledge about its severity and chance of a hit, buying insurance and also protecting the pods by raising the level. Initially I focused on building as many pods as I could. Then I spent time intermittently  researching the comets so that in case of a hit, I had sufficient time for building community protections and upgrading the built pods so as to reach the development goal. While researching the comets, depending on the severity I raised the protection bar accordingly. If I spent too much time on risk preparation tasks like on researching comets or raising the protection bar, I didn't have enough time for development. Likewise if I spent too much money on insurance or protection, I didn't have enough money to invest in development. The first time I played I didn't focus much on research instead I focused on development, protection and insurance. Because of that even on being hit by a comet I didn't have enough time to build community connections. Thereafter I focused more time and money on developing the pods and researching the comets while having a minimum protection of atleast 4-5 bars which got me through 5 levels. I spent money on buying insurance only in the last 2 levels where the chance of multiple comets hitting at the same time was more. Balance between all the three risk management tasks i.e, knowledge, protection and insurance is necessary to confront the risks. Raising the protection level to the severity of the comet, prevents it from hitting and damaging the pods. Even in case of a hit, damages to the pods can be prevented if sufficient time has been spent on gaining knowledge through researching the comets. Buying insurance helps cut down a part of the repair costs in case of damages to pods. In this game researching the comets gives information about the severity and probability of a hit both of which are relevant to taking decisions with respect to risk management. Whereas in real world not all times historical information about a particular risk is available, for SARS epidemic in 2002-03. This factor could have been incorporated in the game. Dealing with situation where information about the severity and probability of a comet is not available and protection bar can't be raised. Similarly all information available need not necessarily be relevant to confront the risk faced. Effective decision making to confront risks involves being able to distinguish relevant information from the irrelevant information and also using the relevant information effectively. This type of situation could also have been added to the game.\n"

Next step was to upgrade the pods as this is more profitable. I did not invest in insurance even at level four and found that it was a total waste of money, that could be instead used to raise the height. I managed to reach level 5 using this strategy - Keep on developing fast (Invest all resources on development), any remaining amount that cannot be used to buy or upgrade a pod can be used to raise the level. By this strategy insurance is not required. Once or twice when the pods did get damaged by the comets, I did not notice a huge impact on finances due to the cost of repairs. The damage was never over 20 percent. Therefore I manage the risk by protecting the pods at a higher level. At the initial level upgrading a pod seems to be more productive and also cheaper than adding a new pod."

It demonstrated in a simplistic way that risk management is a complicated task affected by many factors. At first I leaned more towards a defensive strategy focusing heavily on protection but I quickly saw that I needed to find a balance between the three to master the game. Moreover, I witnessed that one's strategy must be ever evolving. Each outcome is unpredictable and the results may influence one's following decisions. Perhaps you focus more on research and purchase cheaper insurance due to the heavy damage from the previous comet. Perhaps you opt to build more as your previous strategy of protection, research and insurance successfully allowed one to avoid any loss. Perhaps you buy more insurance because you observe several oncoming comets of high severity. These trade-offs are effectively demonstrated in the game play and thus the game illustrates how one must use all three skills to adapt one's community to mitigate risk.\n\nI played the game multiple times and as I stated previously, at first I focused more on protection especially in the early stages of my community's development. However, this exhausted resources and prevented me from multi-tasking which inhibited me from building more, earning more and even buying proper insurance when needed. I adapted a more balanced plan as I became more accustomed to the game. I saw that knowledge indirectly affects protection as it gave the community time to communicate and respond properly to oncoming comets often preventing damage. This was a cost efficient way to adjust to disaster. I could build better homes. Also, with the additional resources I could purchase better insurance for the most severe of comets. Ultimately, this illustrated to me that risk management is a complex strategy that requires the proper amount of flexibility, planning and preparation. \n\nIf I could change anything about the game, I would want to have an explanation as to why I lost a level. I did not get past level 4 but it was not clear to me why the bar was below goal. I think this would be helpful in understanding in hindsight what prevented success a scenario. For instance to apply a real life example, if I moved to a a home in new area but wasn't aware that a creek nearby floods once a year, I may not buy flood insurance because I lack knowledge about this risk. However, once disaster hits, then in hindsight I can learn from this experience and prepare for the following year. It would be helpful to know why you lose a level so that you can adjust your strategy if you opt to try again."

With this knowledge, I sought out how the community could be protected from these uncertainties. I provided this information to all the stakeholders . I proposed that something like a comet shied be built so that it can intercept or destroy any comets or such objects that might be coming from the outer  space. This was a very expensive project that required funding from multiple sources. The community obtained insurance to mitigate the risk.

I hired always an insurance at the beginning of every level, but as I didn't have much money, only the 50% or less. But again, with the good connections after a hit, there was never damage to repair. I also kept a good level of protection 6/7, or higher if the asteroid coming had a higher level of menace. While the villages were developing I always kept a look at the sky for new threats, and always as soon as an asteroid appeared I looked at its characteristics and tryed to make as much research I could on those with higher possibility of hitting the planet. I also noticed that from level 4 (more or less) reaching the goal was harder. Development took longer, was more expensive. I reached a point that I didn't know what else could I do. "

Trade-offs for money exist between building (upgrading)  a new pod or buying insurance or increasing protection, and/or research. The later two also create a trade-off for time - creating protection and research take both time to establish which means you have to stay with only one thing. There were potential for optimisation: ie if I knew the meteorite to be of minor severity I could increase my protection instead of researching the meteorite - this would be able to protect me against future meteorites of similar or less severity, without investments into repair. (However with meteorites of higher severity research is the only thing that can at least partially handle the problem.) Research, as far as I could tell, allowed me to minimize that damage for the meteorites with created severity. Insurance fulfilled a similar function. I found insurance particularly beneficial and made a pattern of insuring at the maximum level - that allowed me to lift the funds restriction on growth potential after a catastrophe. However increasing protection implied that the water increase was placed on hold while the level of the elevation went up - hence the pay-off for safer territory was very costly when taking into account time restrictions.

I learned from this that preparing for risk affected immediately the development of the city. On my second attempt I over developed the community and researched a lot but after a few attacks my community was completely destroyed. On my third time playing I had already learned from my mistakes so I tried to distribute my resources and time the best way possible. What I did was I decided to research the asteroids that traveled more slowly to have enough time to research them completely. When other faster asteroids arrived I focused on rising my protection and buying insurance when needed.

The main trade-off is between and the researching a meteor and the protection of the surface. We wont be able to do both together and a lot of time is consumed in this. Taking insurance is a safe method and it will cost to our total resources. I had to play the game at least 10 times to reach level 5 and during each game I experimented on each factors like first using insurance and fast advancement which landed me nowhere, but the next time when i started with a balance in protection and advancement i was able to go much higher levels by buying insurance only when i was sure research will not help or when severity was too high compared to protection . Also the channeling of resources among the pods helped to raise the protection bar because of which in most cases the damage to pods was averted. So for me the takeaway is timely decision along with a balance trade-off in research and protection against a risk help us to manage risk more effectively."

In terms of the tradeoffs, the main tradeoff was in terms of maintaining the cash levels for development while at the same time having enough cash for the risk mitigation measures. There was also another level of trade off involved which was among knowledge, protection and insurance. My strategy was to invest heavily on protection and knowledge to minimize the damage caused by the impact and hence afford a lower insurance cost. The impact this strategy had on development was that there was a rush/crunch towards development pre-impact while there was always little or no damage because of the impact.\n2. The game drove home a clear message that risk, though of varying magnitude (strength of impact of the comet), is inevitable.  Some risks are prone to a particular area while others happen sporadically (chance of hit). But for successful growth of a community, opportunities have to be pursued in this risk-filled environment.  Risk acts as a great impediment to development but there are always measures to deal with risk both pre and post occurrence of the risk event (comet impact). \nThese measures become even more effective when they are pooled together by a community (the island in the game) rather than an individual (pod) as it may be difficult for one individual/household to adopt measures of such high magnitude. One proactive measure of risk mitigation is to create the necessary infrastructure based on the risks that are repetitive in a particular geography – one example would be using proper construction techniques/materials in higher seismic zones similar to the angle of elevation on the island. The second measure would be community/state driven investments in warning mechanisms, like the research tab in the game which can be compared to the tsunami alert systems installed across the globe. \nSometimes, it is very difficult to cope up with the impact left behind by the occurrence of a risk event. But if the community can predict the frequency of the risk event, then insurance provides the best possible mitigation. One of the best examples is the rainfall insurance in countries like Ghana and India where the frequency of monsoon failure is very high. \nIt is amidst all this risk, that opportunities for growth and development are present. The construction and up gradation of the pods on the island cannot stop because there are risks of damage being caused by a comet impact. Instead, it is important to pursue these opportunities by taking proper mitigation measures, like the ones listed earlier, and cover for the risk event. \nIn conclusion, the game was a close replication of a real life scenario in any community and educates the importance of risk mitigation measures and community pooling of risk in order to pursue the opportunities for the great good of the society as a whole.\n3. One change that I would bring in to the game would be to create a cost benefit ratio for the risk event thus showing the importance of analyzing the extent to which risk will affect development and take the precautionary measures in a measured manner (neither over-invest nor under-invest in such measures).\n"

Preparation affects  risk management which  includes knowledge, getting information on risk, but then using that information to make judgments, obtaining protection, measures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, or obtaining insurance, measures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times.I played the game three to four times , at every next time i tried to take steps which i couldn’t take earlier like increasing insurance and increasing meter indication everytime.Lastly their must be a one more hint or pattern which could clarify the game more easily.

The obvious trade offs in the beginning was whether to upgrade the colony and having to determine possible risks and buying the appropriate insurance and protection to handle possible negative shocks. I found out that if I invested too much in insurance and protection I didn't have enough resources to invest in upgrading the colony. It seemed that investing in upgrades was what gained me the most points to reach my goal per each round so it was imperative to figure the right balance in protection, insurance, and development. I also noticed that by invested in upgrades to the colony I made more money, so the obvious benefit to investing in upgrades was making more money that would then allow me to invest more in other avenues of risk management."

It is how you learn and react from your mistakes is how you will improve your chances to minimize risk moving forward.

One strategy was to build out the community rapidly and not consider the proper amount of insurance needed to protect the community. Another strategy was not to build out at all and that strategy didn't work out either. The problem was education and insurance and not finding balance."

But spending 5 points was worth for planning to make a new shell of have enough credits to rebuild the structures after they have been hit . I bought the insurance for 75% coverage and tried best to dilute the effect into the community and lowering the damage .But while trying to get planning in act for risk management I had to make a little trade off with development . I had to wait for credits to accumulate after I bought insurance and  lifted the level up. In the level2 of the game, I focused upon monitoring the comets and then allocating the shells for second level upgrade.

Preparation for risk affected development directly since the loss in the budget to cover for risk postponed upgrading of the houses or the number of the houses built in Aurora.\n\nI played the game twice since the first time I was not really able to understand the functions and the instructions of the platform (not native English speaker and I don't really play games). In the second time that I played I undertook a better insurance plan (75% covering of damage), researched more the passing meteors and raising the island higher to avoid the more dangerous ones. However, these actions didn't allow me to built a bigger society and upgrade the existent houses. So losing level 2 was obvious and that I would change if I had time to play again. The main things I learned are researching for the risk, undertaking insurance for risk, and that these procedure can postponed development.\n\nBecause I live in Greece a simple and realistic option that I would add is to lose your budget for development."

Comets were observed so that you had a better knowledge/understanding of the severity/potential damage, as well as the likelihood/chance of being hit.  At the same time, you had the option to buy insurance and you were expected to continue development throughout.  By taking the time and money to prepare for risk (observing the comet, spending money to increase your severity, and purchasing insurance), pod development had to be postponed.  But then when the pods got attacked, you were able to recover much faster because of all the steps you'd taken.  So it was much easier to recover from a disaster.  To succeed at the game, you also had to balance everything, you couldn't just focus on one or two tasks exclusively.  Instead, you had to do all of them together and quickly go back and forth to manage your risk (from various angles - observing the comet, increasing severity and purchasing insurance) and increase pod development.\n\nIf I were to play the game again, I would make sure that I do all of the above (pod development, observe the comet, purchase insurance, and increase severity to match).  Initially, I didn't spend enough time on comet observation, but once I did, then I got more time to recover from attacks and thus sustained less damage.  I'd also spend more time watching comets that have higher chance of hitting (i'd focus more on those).  If a comet is less dangerous (less severe and very low chance of hitting), I would observe for a bit, but then I'd focus on other tasks.  Whereas if it was high-risk (then I'd spend time observing and matching severity).\n\nIf I was to make one change to the game, I'd add financial risk.  While natural disasters such as comets are risks, in today's world, particularly, the financial market is such an embedded part of the world, that it consists of a risk.  You could enable this risk by the pods not always returning a consistent stream of income, and instead sometimes they don't give you the revenues/growth you expect.  It might be too complicated to implement this in the game, but a simple addition would be to add a random multiplicative factor to the $ coming from pod development, and that factor can very between 0.5 and 1.25.  This way, you could demonstrate the financial risks that impact people's salaries and firms growth prospects."

For example, when I began playing I placed a premium on purchasing insurance immediately, so as to insure myself against damage from a comet. But I eventually realized that sometimes I would “get lucky” and avoid severe comet damage during a level. In this case, it was best to delay the purchase of insurance until my research revealed a severe threat. If only non-severe comets emerged, I could simply pay out of pocket to repair the damage.

I played the game several times, at the first time, I bought the insurance at the very beginning of each level and only built 3 of the pods and kept developing them first. This strategy doesn't work for me since buying insurance lost money which could be used for development or building new pods. For the second time, based on the knowledge of severity of attack, I chose the protection level matched to severity and didn't buy insurance at all. Most of the time, this strategy works, however, the knowledge is not accurate enough (uncertainty) sometimes. I tried to use two different strategies, one is buy insurance, the other is increasing the level of protection and making protection higher than the predicted severity. Both of them worked in some way, From the game, it is quite obvious that if we can protect well without vigorously affecting development, we can pass the level for sure. Once the damage occurred, it is very hard to recover, especially if the damage happened in later stages. Buying insurance would help recovery, but the effect is limited. I feel like good preparation is the best way to reduce damage and for overwhelming damage, insurance is necessary. In the game, it is hard to determine when would be a best time to buy insurance. Just as in reality, insurance won't be executed for approximately half of the times. Also, I found that if I build more pods at the beginning and even though each of the pod won't develop very fast, but the overall green bar grows faster in this way(compared to less pods with higher levels) I think this may implicate that the wider-coverage protection with lower level would be more effective than partial protection with high level. If I would developing a new version of the game, I would make what factors influence the speed of green bar more clearly."

An inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals. In this game, for instance, the developing community was faced with a continual risk from approaching meteorites. Now, there are two ways to mitigate that risk: by raising the level of the community in terms of height, and by buying insurance against damage. But there is a catch-22 situation here: these mitigators of risk themselves present a risk to development. While faced with a shortage of resources (money and time here), adopting the aforementioned measures against risk would mean a wastage of these scarce resources in the event that the community is not actually affected (as in the case when the meteor does not hit). Thus, there is a trade-off between protection and development. However, it has to be duly noted that the more knowledge the community possessed with respect to the risks it faced, the more likely it was  to make an informed decision, that would be beneficial. Again, gaining additional knowledge involves some costs, in the process diverting resources away from development. Another risk is development itself. By tactfully stopping additional development until any imminent danger is past, the community can save on resources spent on repairing damage. This would be possible only by gathering knowledge, and adequate preparation."

Also you have to understand risks\nProbability and Impact to choose right level of protection and insurance. Also\nit was important to establish links between communities in order to avoid\nsevere risk impacts.

So, I think to answer the\nabove question that preparation affects immediately to the development, I mean\nthat your funds are transferred to the protection or insurance instead of development.\nAlso it impact the development after some time (when risk happens), in this\ncases if not or very low protection or insurance schema is taken then there is\nsevere impacts on your world and hence your development is delayed because 1)\nyour production is lower because of the risk impact and 2) you have to spend\nyour funds to the reconstructions and coping with risks results meaning your\nearning are lowered as well."

Research was very important and once\nI found out the advantages (especially the time you gain for making community\nties and thereby raising the ground level) it was my primary line of defense.

Working together yielded much more protection than just raising\nthe ground level by paying for it. My other line of defense was raising the\nground level ( I am Dutch it is what we do at home as well ). The only problem\nwas the raising of the ground level basically stalled your development. I only\nused it in the beginning when the pods are developing ( When they are repaired\nof upgraded the development is stalled as well) or at the end of each level\nwhen I had reached the pass mark already. I therefore upgraded the pods only at\nthe end of the level unless I could early on see I would not make the\ndevelopment mark without additional development. This actually reminded me of\nthe Keynes model of economics. Save money when times are good so you can spend\nit when times are bad. I would save the money as long as the development was in\nthe green and then invest it in upgrading pods or upgrading protection just\nbefore times became rough again ( the beginning of the next level).

In the various games I've played I have followed different strategies. In the first games, I preferred build many houses quickly, but this also left me with no money to repair them after disasters. So I preferred as I was playing more, building fewer houses but upload faster level, this strategy was more successful and allowed me to go up to level 2. The game can still be significantly improved. I would put a greater number of natural disasters to make it more fun.

It gave me more time to raise my protection level and develop my pods, If the severity level and ch the chance of the comet hitting of the comet were high, I made sure I had insurance covering 75% of the loss. Moreover, if only the chance of the comet hitting was high but the severity level was low, then there was no need to expend on protection. Protection against waves was needed only if the possibility of damage was high. Therefore, to save money for development and insurance, it was important to match my level of protection with the severity of the comet to protect my pods against the possible damage. In such a situation, when risk is uncertain and complex, I decided not only to gain knowledge, but also to use the information with me to make judgement. I prepared by obtaining protection and insurance. Also, to cope afterwards, I repaired my pods and upgraded them. "

Another thing that I learned from the game was that making some connections with another pods and getting more knowledge about comets we could make more time in order to identify them, and also diminishing the uncertainty on how a comet may cause damage.\n\nI would add a simple thing in the game that is make more accurate the knowledge, protection and insurance in real life, I mean, adapting that situation to a real life scenario in which we can identify not only the damage cause by a natural disaster, but viewing the cost of the damage, the human beings affected, those things that usually an organization reports after a natural disaster, but basically the game teaches us how to prevent a disaster, talking on risk either insurance, deaths, knowledge, protection, or others aspects in risk management in order to overcome a disaster and getting the less damage.\n"

I didn´t build so many pods and their upgrades was not my priority because I was more focused on protection and, when needed, in research. My goal was to achieve the minimum level requested for each level and have enough money available for recovery in case of damages. \nNevertheless due to limited resources and time I could not have an healthy and enough fast development and using protection, insurance and research at the same time. Therefore I had also to evaluate which one among the three protection tools was the best.\nI invested more in protection instead of research and insurance. Protection was for me the best measures to prevent pods for being damage: it was an enduring protection in every level. In my option the trade-off was related to the ability in using insurance and research only when strictly necessary, in the specific case only when the impact´s severity and chance of hit by a comet were both high. Indeed, I didn´t understand how it worked the connection among the pods in case of hit by a comet. However I saw that more I clicked and more I created connection (I suppose that the green clouds on the pods were the connections) with the results of reduce the shocks of the comets ´impact. It worked also very well. \nHowever I noticed that risk management concerned not only the costs but also the Timing: the decision to invest more in insurance and research had not be taken too late, otherwise their impact would be pointless.   \nEven if I live near a big river, now there are not many risks regarding natural disaster: Thank to what government did in the past (monitoring of the river flood, building banks, etc…). I think that was a good example how  risk management is important for community development.\nThe risk management was necessary in order maximize the use of limited resources, but also the times in which resources should be used. Fast development was not the best choice without protection and the possibility of quick recovery in case of damages.\n"

Thus facing trade-offs between knowledge, protection, and insurance, I devoted a greater part of my resources to the processes of prevention, namely knowledge and protection. Initially (in the early levels), preparation for risk didn't have significant positive effects on development. It was when both the chances and the severities of the risks were high that preparation for risk could be visibly regarded as a good investment. "

Proceeding through levels and playing the game multiple times taught the author that there is no one universal rule and perfect risk management tool. Rather all the components must be balanced and used simultaneously.\n\nAs for the negatives, overall I really liked the reflection. Maybe only one thing can be added. Ways of how preparation for risks affects development could be discussed a bit further. For example, it may have been stated that expenditures on protection, insurance and research are immediate, i.e. impose costs straight away. However their benefits are available only after the shock hits. Therefore in the short term it might seem like costs of risk preparation outweigh the immediate benefits. However, after the shock occurs, preparation makes it much easier to cope with it and that's where the apparent benefits of the effective risk management come in.\n",

Otherwise, all your money would be spent on developing. What worked for me was to spend all my money at once on developing until the progress bar was green, research incoming meteors for at least a second, and spend time/money on protection for meteors according to their threat level. No money on insurance, the game modeled that really poorly. Once my progress bar reached the goal, and time was left in the counter, then I invested all my money in protection for the next level.",

Challenges (comets) may come and are sometimes inevitable but there are actions you can take to mitigate the damages such as taking out insurance and protecting yourself. With proper research and knowledge you would be in a better position to know the best action(s) to take.

I preferred to hold a medium protection and to monitor every comet, focussing on those with high severity, which led to immediately safety and a reasonable safety after some time. At first I built a lot and developed less, but then I learnt to build less and gradually and upgrade a bit at a time. This allowed to have more money to use to pay for new buildings, upgrades and damages. One thing that was very helpful to pass levels and that I think is an important aspect of risk management was research comets, because it is less expensive than paying for possible damages. I tried to balance knowledge and protection, as well as development. It would have been nice to have more focus on the connection aspect of the game and risk management not only when the comets strike, but also during the knowledge and development stages, which in real life can make people better understand the danger they possibly could face."

The choices I made at the beginning of the game to 1. buy insurance  and 2. build protection, based on the severity of  the incoming threat. This trade off meant that I was not able  to build the community at a faster rate to generate wealth. I found that there was a diminishing rate of return from protection, particularly when the threat was severe. I also learnt that the severity of risk did not always equate to the size of the damage. While playing in Level three, I found that it was very difficult to generate wealth in the community.  While investing large sums in the community, the rate of return on investment was slow. \n\nI played the game numerous times to try out different strategies. I tried just buying insurance and building a community as quickly as possible. Sometimes this worked, other times it didn't as it didn't generate significant wealth. I tried buying protection and building a community only. This was the least successful strategy as the cost of repairs was prohibitive. I found the combination of buying some insurance, some protection, and building the community with the available resources to be the most successful strategy.\n\nThe main thing I learnt from the game was to assess risk as soon possible to monitor its severity as it crossed the screen, and try to prepare for it with the resources available I also learnt that there was a limit to the amount of protection that could be purchased that offset some of the effects of the damage caused by the comets. \n\n\n\nI live in an earthquake-prone part of my country. I would tweak the game by omitting the comets and introducing earthquakes. The aim of the game would be to build a rise high rise building, built to withstand a 7.7 earthquake on the Richter Scale through six rounds of the game. Each round of the game would involve building three levels. Resources available would include cash for property development - complying with current regulations and building standards, property insurance, and property protection in the form of  purchasing base isolators,  allowing the building to sway in an earthquake. The rate of return upon Investment into the building would increase expediently. Earthquakes will roll underground  across the screen, at various depths and severity, monitored by a seismic recorder, which will let you know the severity of the quake.  The timeline for building each floor, and the amount of money available will be similar to the comet game. The one thing I would include in the game is an evacuation strategy to be included in the build. As earthquakes occur at any time, such a  strategy is essential. \n\nThe winner has built a safe and secure six-storied building, that will withstand a 7.7 earthquake on the Richter Scale."

I reached level 5 after three failed attempts to pass level 3 once I realized that 1) I could not focus solely on creating and improving pods, 2) purchasing insurance was expensive, and if the buildings were damaged I would have to pay more, 3) that defending the city by increasing the height above sea level took time and money, and 4) it was very important to research comets prior to their arrival as it could improve the city's defense. Preparation for risk often involved taking away precious resources of time and money away from development. However, during these failed attempts I came to realize that a strategic combination of all four would be needed to pass level 3. \nIn my successful venture I followed the following procedure. In the first level I developed five level one pods, which is how many you can make with the initial investment. In previous attempts I had developed as many level one pods as possible, but that did not allow for adequate risk preparation. I raised the city to level 3 protection in between researching comets. I took advantage of the end of the level after I had already reached my goal, because I had enough income and there were no more comets. In level 2, I improved the existing pods and developed the rest of the land with level one pods. I raised the city to level 5 protection. I usually tried to research comets up to level 6 to ensure I would have enough time to form enough connections. Otherwise I relied on the city's existing defense if the comet's damage was low. I continued this strategy of developing my pods, researching comets, and building my defense up to level 7 until level 4, during which I first purchased insurance, because the comets were becoming stronger and more frequent and I did not have ample time to build the city defense. In level 5, I purchased the maximum amount of insurance for $852 and after a level 8 comet damaged my city, I had to pay $161 per building for repairs. This burden of cost and lowered production created a major setback and I was unable to reach my goal. In addition, the time it took to improve pods to level 5 was much longer and after the attack, I did not have ample time and money to improve all the pods. \nIf I were to play the game again, I would try to focus on improving city defense manually because it is the cheapest option and not to buy insurance because it is quite costly and after the city is damaged, it takes more time and money to recover which can be a fatal blow. I would also try to accumulate an excess income prior to level 5 in order to allow enough time for all my pods to be upgraded once more to reach my goal.\nIf I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, a minor change I would make to better reflect the place in which I live would be to add the possibility to add more types of defense like missiles to intercept and explode the comets prior to impact. I feel like the US is a great military power and this is a typical defense for our country."

Countries have a limited budget that they need to decide where to spend do they build hospitals and roads and invest in education or do they protect the infrastructures they already have like creating barriers against floods or buying insurance in case of a disaster. \n\nI played the game more than once  , the first time I started to develop just a pair of ‘’houses’’ while It is true that they reached the higher level faster I only managed to get to level two. On the second time I decided to spread the development homogeneously so building in all of the spaces and only moving to the next level of development once all of the houses had reached them. I do not know if the game actually contemplated this but it is true that when developing a country inequalities create tension so it is better to try not to leave some areas completely unattended. \n\n\nFinally, if I were to change some things in a new version of the game I would make evident that the less developed areas (the poorer areas) are more damaged and take longer to go back to normality than wealthier areas when a disaster happens. I think this would make the game a bit more realistic.\n"

During the game I had mentioned that there were different types of meteorites and for the best preparation to prevent risk we had to research them and the more we obtain knowledge about potential negative event the more we can protect the environment. Preparation for the risk affect development after some time, not immediately. We have to spend time and money to create a good risk management system. The fist step that we have to do is to collect data about possible negative event (risk). Risk events consists from 3 components: severe,possibility, research. The risk event can bring a small damage,but the possibility that it occurs can be large or can bring a disaster with small possibility. We have to constantly analyze risks, on the first step of analysis the uncertainty is the most, but the more we analyze the more confident we become about the event and the better protection system we can create.

The consideration to choice is depended on the situation in the game, if many obstacle coming through I would identify the damage and the hit chance at a glance, if most of them have massive damage, I would take the 50% coverage insurance option, because I consider the money would be better used for other things like make a robust protection, thus I wouldn't take 75% coverage insurance option. If, the obstacles seems have huge damage but very low chance to hit, I wouldn't underestimate them, and still would build a better protection, do a research for certainty and subdue the damage.

This situation represent the importance of investigation and knowledge for prepare one plan of coping a threats and unexpected risks, when we don’t examine what we are facing the risk of fail, increases.\n\nIn the next time that I play the game, I will pay more attention in the investigation, and I will take more conscious decisions because sometimes I used my intuition for develop a strategy for win, I don't prepared a plan and in some moments I lost a lot of time thinking what was the best option, but my answer was incorrect, and in many opportunities I can't pass the second level.\n\nI would add more options for answer the situation for example the power to diverting or safely remove the meteorite; it will cost more money but is a new option that can represent no damage to the infrastructure and the people. The chance of hit is based in preventive measures and this options bring this option and some settings for the form and construction of the infrastructure is necessary, for win the game.\n\nThis game show me in what aspects I fail and how the use of new strategies with knowledge, preventative measures , and good resource management make the difference in win or lost the opportunity of development. \n\nThanks.

However, time-constraints and financial limitations lead to certain trade offs: The cost of taking out insurance coverage decreases the availability of financial resources to construct or upgrade new houses or the cost of elevating the land. Moreover, the time spend on comet research diminishes the availability of time for constructing new buildings and elevating the land mass. "

I also always aimed for the highest possible level of insurance in order to save costs of damages if they occur. Preparation for risks slows down development, but on the other hand if the meteor hits the community and damages happen, they slow down as well. The main things I learned from the game are: important to invest in development of the society, however not on the cost of risk-preparedness. Insurance in the game plays a big role, which I'm not sure is the case in real life. I played the game four times, on the fourth time I tried to invest in fewer number of settlements but instead develop them as fast as possible. I also learned that if the level of preparedness is too high in comparison to the level of risk of the meteors, the investment is wasted. If I would develop a new version of the game, I would put more attention to the research-component, and also invent different kinds of risks (not only meteors) in order to raise awareness of variety of possible risks hitting communities.

The choices I made were as follows :-\n1.\tPrioritize the comets based on the level of impact and accordingly gain their knowledge.\n2.\tTry and maintain high levels of protection which can save from any sort of impact.\n3.\tSince the resource money was limited, only a bare minimum insurance was taken.\nIn the beginning of the game when Alora was in the growth phase, development as well as managing risk demanded fewer resources. As the game progressed and reached its advanced stages, development became costlier in terms of requirement of resources as well as managing risk. In the later part of the game risk management started consuming most of the resources and only little resources could be allocated to growth. Hence it was imperative to have a strategy in place wherein resources had to be allocated to the preparation and reduction of risk, mitigating the effects of disaster when it actually struck, and growth of the community. The appropriate allocation of the limited resources on risk management and development helped in reaching to the higher levels of the game.\n\nAfter playing the game once I realized that I was concentrating more on the development part and lesser on the risks. In my first attempt, I could not achieve the desired results since I had allocated a major chunk of the resources on development and in the process had overlooked the preparation required to mitigate risks. Inspite of initial growth, this led to massive destruction in the later stages.  Also I was consistently trying to optimize the resource utilization by giving each and every Power i.e. knowledge, protection and insurance equal weight without classifying the comets on the basis of their severity of impact/probability of hitting. \nThe next time I played the game I was able to comprehend the game better. I allotted the resources wisely to reduce and mitigate the risk as well as took the opportunities available for the growth of the community Alora. \nThe main learning from the game was that managing risk is an equally important part in the development of a community. In the case of Alora, it was seen that the community simply perished in the absence of proper risk management. Risk management is mostly seen as a cost/waste of resources. However this is not the case. An active preparation of an event before it actually occurs and an action plan in case a catastrophe hits, should be in place. Also all the constraints should be understood properly and only then an action plan to reduce risk should be developed.\n\nIn India one of the major problems is drought. A lot of farmers are dependent on rain for the crops. However rainfall in India is erratic. There is a high risk since in the absence of regular and continuous rainfall, crops perish. This leads to high rates of farmer suicides during such periods.  For the survival of crops, this risk needs to be managed actively. This can be done by reducing the dependence on rains by having water canal systems and artificial means of water supply. Such measures will keep the farmers prepared for drought like situations, thereby reducing the level of impact and leading to higher levels of production. This risk due to uncertainty in rainfall is one feature that can be added in a new version of the game.\n"

One of the aspects of risk management is to manage natural risks which are intrinsic to the region, in this case the risk being the meteor strikes. So to develop the community or in other words to advance to the next level in the game we need to have enough resources which are gathered by the pods, but the meteor strikes hamper this development by damaging the pods. So we need to find the right balance between development and managing risk by using tools such as insurance and community co-ops etc., which are provided in the game. The main choice which I had to make was how to balance between development and protection(managing risk). If more resources were to be spent on risk management alone then the rate of development would lag and we would fail to advance. So at times instead of completely averting the risk it was easier to manage the after-effects of risk once it has been realised, through means such as insurance and community co-op which are provided in the game. The preparation for risk did affect the development by slowing the rate of development as the game progressed to higher levels. The cost of managing risk also grew with the proportional growth in the scale of the risk."

And adjust with the future risk to save the land. Basically I wanted to develop the plot to minimize the risk from comet. First of all I used my knowledge which plot should I develop with the cost minimization for taken future risk. I used maximum Protection, I think if we conscious about the future happen we can minimize the risk and I save my plot and pod from the comets. I also used different insurance plan when I see the comets severity is high and chance of the comets attack is so high. So I took insurance for future risk minimization. I always take some time to affect development plot because I want to see the future comets attack and about my money position. I played the game more than once and enjoyed that. I saw the difference between from the first and last game is if you more research about the risk and maintain the prospective ways like use knowledge, protection and insurance that is possible to risk minimization. In my first game I did not know how to tackle the comets and what is best way to minimize the risk in cost effective way. But in the last game I know the proper way and overcame develop the plot in best way. So I understand need to learn about the risk and risk management. The main things I learned from the game that take prior preparation and conscious about the risk to minimize the future risk. This game is full of knowledge about the risk management and faced some problems and learned how to overcome from there. But I think we are faced always same type of risk in same way. If we develop the area to face different type of risk like cyclone, floods, droughts and other most important risk factor. Comets is the good way to think about risk but it should be practical way to learn with enjoy. On the other hand the graphics is not better to reflect to children or young people to learn risk management. If it is developed I think every level of person enjoy to play this game and gather knowledge. Overall the idea is fantastic but it can be developed with proper way and can be possible way to make awareness about risk management and its opportunity."

The powers of research, protection and insurance were the strategies without which risk could not be managed and would have resulted in greater loss due to disaster. In order to maintain the balance between development and protection, several trade offs were faced along with managing the finance for risk management, protection from shocks, insurance and development of the community. The limited financial resources called for their distribution in an economical and efficient way. The most important trade off faced was between investing in development and in protection. In order to protect the community from the disaster and the following loss, providing protection was inevitable. The insurance helped in reducing the extent of damage caused as the insurance companies provided with monetary aid to repair. As a result, these activities involved in risk management affected the development by reducing its pace. Development of community stagnated for a while when the finance was being used for protection and insurance. However, the development did not show any depleting trend. Playing the game four times taught me the importance of development within the limited time frame. Keeping a pace with the development level along with the protection and insurance level was an essential to win the game. Thus, by taking this factor in account I accomplished three levels and reached fourth. I lost the game twice while I was about to reach the fifth level. The game taught the essentials of developing a community with keeping every aspect in mind particularly the risk management for the potential danger that could accompany severe loss. The game was self explanatory which was its best quality. The good difficulty level showed that the strategies of risk management require both time money and resources. \nIf tasked with development of new version of the game I would like to add up some more risk management strategies apart from the powers of research, insurance and protection. Migration of the people living in the community to safer areas when the warning is provided – is a component important to risk management. By adding this dimension to the game people will avail the opportunity to safeguard themselves by moving to safer ares.Improving the research facilities and early warning systems could strengthen the protection.  Also, improving the after damage aid will provide a commendable assistance. \nOverall, the game experience was challenging and memorable. It taught the foundation of risk management and its strategies, its significance and its impacts. Therefore, it is evident that risk management is an indispensable force which is integral to the development process.\n"

This and the community links benefit were the main learning for me. On a contrarian note, I did not find safe buildings being incentivised adequately. A building away from the shore should be hurt less by waves- I did not see that happening. \nI felt initially that ,considering the low cost,insurance should not be made available for the entire duration of the level, but later realised that this is exactly how a good public insurance scheme should be. Unfortunately public and micro-insurance  have not really taken off in my country. So don't really have a great perspective.\n\nAll in all, had a good time reaching level 4."

Knowledge is more effective in the short term in the case of  preparation against adverse effect and in fact in this case it increases immediately the resources at disposal of community;  insurance is more effective on the long term since insurance intervenes only in case of adverse effect;  protection is effective in the medium term since the rising of the island increases slowly with time. The policy of preparation for risk through risk management strategy affects positively the development of the community by creating more resources with deepening the knowledge of risk, by protecting the already erected pods by raising the island to the correct height (so destruction is avoided), by putting in place community protections since they are very effective in curing the effects of undergoing disaster and eventually bring the effect and the impact to zero; preparation through insurance is very wise move and effective when disaster actually causes damage and repairs can take place more quickly and extensively thanks to insurance."

Most of the time you had to chose between spending your time on holding the protection key (right below) or on researching the asteroid approaching. As you clarified, research could give you the opportunity to have more time (after impact of an asteroid) to create 'connections' which also increased your protection / minimizing the damage of impact (just for that impact once). Investing your resources in protection generally costs more time, but helps on the long term (not only once). Your reflection did not make clear what your strategy was to that tradeoff.

As the game progressed the player needed to balance the potential detrimental effects of the asteroid hits with the continuing development of their buildings. A player could \"research\" an asteroid which would allow the player more time after impact to minimize the damage. This is a common concept in real life, the greater you understand the risk itself and its potential impact on your endeavors the easier it is to plan for that risk. Also by understanding the risk you can take advantage of times when the risks are minimal and brace for periods when the risks increase. The game continued in this vein by allowing the player to purchase insurance to reduce the cost of repairs that the players buildings would need in the event of an impact. This again is familiar to any property owner (e.g. car, home, commercial property), the amount of insurance you need is not just the general value of the property but what will be needed to replace the property in the event of damage."

In my opinion the game needed strategic planning to be\ncompleted. Therefore, I have pursued a specific plan. When starting the game, I\nhave noticed that protection is the most important tool to have an effective\nrisk management and that protection and insurance depends on the knowledge we\nhave.In other words, I have increased the protection level and\nbought a more expensive insurance only if I knew that the severity and the\nprobability to be hit by a comet is high. During the game I have confronted\nonly one trade-off: Balancing. To be successful in it, I have chosen to\nconstantly upgrade my pods to earn more money but at the same time I was highly\nprotecting my land, and buying moderate insurance. Because I came up with a\nconclusion that if I have a high protection level, then I will not need an\nexpensive insurance to cover my losses, since comets will not or will rarely\nhit my land. But on the contrary, if I buy the most expensive insurance and\ndon’t increase my protection, then comets will bomb the land and I will be\nloosing a lot of money by repairing my pods.As far as I am concerned, in real life, preparation for risk\ndoesn’t show its positive result until a risk emerges. And that can sometimes\ntake years. Whereas in the game the preparation of risk affected development\nimmediately maybe because of the short time we had in each level."

This was crucial, because making the community connections limited the amount of damage done. Where the struggle to find balance was in the time spent researching while being able to spend money and develop. I often found that i could spend time in research and protect the community but not be able to spend the money and would loose because of it. The trade offs that i discovered were necessary in being successful in the game was to manage time spent in research. At first i didn't even know how to make community connections and wasn't until i did that i saw the importance of keeping the community from perilous damage. The other adjustment was keeping an eye on the clock for each round, if there was only so much time left it didn't make sense to spend so much of it in protecting. "

When i put in more effort to manage the risk I was able to reduce the damage and keep the meter green. At the same time I realized there was a lot to do and i was confused where to build a new pod or monitor the comet or protect. I figured out i had to balance all three at a balanced level in order to succeed.

But successful development comes from a process much more difficult than that. It takes years of research, trial and error, to determine what investments will benefit the country most, to find the resources to support the development, and to insure that the investments will last. "

I have considered all\nthe 3 factors of risk management i.e. \nKnowledge, Protection and Insurance equally.  I have taken protection as the first\ncomponent because it helps in bearing a lot of shocks initially and also help\nin saving resources which would otherwise been used for insurance. Gaining\nKnowledge about the shocks is the next most important component. If the\nseverity of shock is to be less and can be balanced by protection, then there\nis not much use of insurance. Insuring is to be considered if severity of shock\nis extreme and cannot be balanced by protection used. Preparation of risk\naffects development initially because while increasing protection level,\ndevelopment was hampered. Also due to lack of much resources development was\naffected. When playing the game for first time I was confused to choose from\nthe 3 components initially. I started the game with having insurance at the\ninitial stage but later on I realised if protection is there then we can save\nresources for increasing development. I shifted my choice to increase\nprotection at the start and then doing research and lastly insurance if necessary.\nMy learning from the game includes that for a healthy development proper risk\nmanagement is must. Development can be very easy if resources are available in\nvast amount but if there is lack of abundant resources a trade-off is to be\nmade between cost and benefit. If a community is protected to the full extent\nthen development can be very easy but in case there is lack of resources and\ntime for full protection, knowledge of the risk helps a lot. By having\nknowledge of the risk decision for the insurance can be easily made. If given a\nchance to modify any aspect of the game, I would like to add places on the\nisland at which there is minimal or no effect of the shocks but in order to buy\nthat places for development some amount of money must be charged. The reason\nfor this modification being there are always places available around us which\nare safer but costlier. "

As resources will be shared and thus this helps the community to re-develop faster incase of any calamity. It is very necessary to prepare for risks as illustrated by the game.

A key take-away is that risk\nmanagement is not a one-off event.  It is\na process which must be understood by individuals and the community at large; systematic operations should be embedded throughout the risk chain."

Each time I played the game, I tried a different strategy.  I believe I played the game a dozen times.  Sometimes I built several structures and purchased the medium insurance, and did lots of research on the meteors, and still try to raise the planets land.  Other times I built a few structures, and tried to increase their strength by upgrading them, and at the same time researching the incoming meteors.  Most of the time I did not get to raise the level of the planet because I was too busy researching the meteors, and trying to improve the building structures.   I could not find the correct balance since I could not get beyond level 3.  The game is very challenging and to degree represents the balancing of risks.  My grandson who is 10 also tried the game and he could not get above level one.  He also found the game to be very challenging.\n2.\tBecause each time the game changed it was hard to come up with a strategy that I believed would work.  When I had good insurance and did lots of research the structures did not cost lots of money to repair, but I found that the meteors came several at a time, with most causing some major damage.   The one risk I had trouble managing was the rising of the planet surface to assist with the protection of the planet.  I tried to build at least 4 structures and have a minimum of basic or medium insurance.  I also tried to do as much research as I could on the incoming meteors.  Sometimes it was more difficult because they came in several at a time.\n3.\tIf I had the ability to change the game, I would make the cost of the structures and insurance a little more reasonable.  I would also give the game player the chance to create public buildings such as police and a fire station, and a hospital.  This would make the game more realistic in my opinion.  If a hospital were to be damaged it would hinder getting help to the citizens, and if a fire station was to get damaged it would hinder the rebuilding process.  Also I would create another type of natural disaster such as earthquakes.\nI found the game to be fun and challenging. And also a very effective learning tool to deal with risks.  It is very hard to find just the right balance to deal with risk no matter how hard we try.\n"

You could chose to spend resources on increasing protection in 'good times', or spend all these resources on building. Meanwhile you had to chose between spending your time on holding the protection key (right below) or on researching the asteroid approaching. Remember, this research could give you the opportunity to have more time (after impact of an asteroid) to create 'connections' which also increased your protection / minimizing the damage of impact (just for that impact once).

In real life people tend to act\nfirst (build refuges) rather than think what is the best strategy and we waste\nso many resources doing the wrong things. I also realize that the game focuses\non the importance of savings.

You have to choose among your\nalternatives in a quick way and this rush sometimes led me to mistakes. With experience\nI learned which choices to pick first and how to build a better money cushion\nfor the future. In the game as in real life you have to chose quickly and your\npast actions have an important effect on your future. Other similitude with\nreal life is that once I had suffered a major impact, I was more willing to do\ncertain things first and I realized that having a larger insurance was the best\npossible strategy, given the size and frequent meteor impacts. "

There are\n3 ways to do so, namely was by either protecting the settlement by raising it\non a platform, purchasing insurance, or by upgrading pods in order to get a\ngreater amount of return. Knowledge on how each of these mechanisms performed\nwas crucial to certain choices. For example, in the initial stages, it was\nimperative to sink a significant portion of capital in to insurance and\nprotection in order to protect whatever little pods were present (just 2 or 3).\nHowever, care need to taken to not overdo this as low wealth can be crippling\nto development. Next, it became clear that the focus shifted to the actual\nconstruction of pods and their development. It seemed more prudent to upgrade\nall pods to certain stage before moving on in order to prevent disparity.\nAdditionally, the balance between insurance and protection played a key factor.\nAs time progressed, it was apparent that although a certain level of protection\nwas required, a medium level (about 5 to 6 bars) was sufficient to mitigate\ndamage by pairing with the highest level of insurance. This optimization allows\nfor the cheapest repairs though protection needed to maintained at 6 bars\nconsistently in the event of a meteor strike. \nAnd finally, knowing which type of comet was going to strike was very\nimportant. Comets with low damage and low probability could effectively be\nignored, while those with medium to high damage required the most attention, regardless of probability. Patterns start to arise once the game is played\nmultiple times. For example, with an impending strike of 2 or more comets\nconsecutively, it was more prudent to repair immediately after the first strike\nat earlier stages (when protection was lower) otherwise there might not have\nbeen any pods to repair at all. But once protection was sufficient, repairs\nmay be handled after the second strike in order to reduce costs. The game\nserves to teach that knowledge is most important and that a certain balance of\ninsurance and protection are extremely important (having only one or the other\nis not sufficient to mitigate all of the risk). Also having connections were\nimportant too, though having a smaller impact. I would change the connection\nmechanism within the game. Perhaps this element could be made to better reflect\nhow international organizations or NGOs provide relief. It could be done in\nsuch a way that certain agreements or tasks have to be satisfied (for overall\ncooperation or peace) for this separate entity to assist in the recovery of the settlement."

In the game, Risk horizon, I identified the risk to the community as falling meteors which causes flooding and created a buffer by way of \"Insurance\", I analysed the risk by way of \"Research\" and responded to the risk by way of \"Protect\".\n\nInsurance: this allowed me have adequate disaster recovery plan. No matter,the level of destruction caused by the falling meteors, insurance made rebuilding and upgrading easier, faster and cheaper.\n\nResearch: allowed me to quantify the risk by evaluating the meteors and prioritising the level of risk and uncertainty and quantify their frequency of occurence and impact. It also was the fastest way to turn the indicator light from red to green thereby reaching your goal faster than would have been possible.\n\nProtect: allowed me to develop response to the identified threat by raising the level of the island in order to either eliminate the threat, deflect the threat or accept the threat and be prepared for it by raising the protection bar level. Raising the level of the community decreases the risk or impact of destruction. Though it seems the best option, it takes too long to get a bar on the protection scale and takes longer to reach your goal.\n\nIn level one, I quickly discovered that knowledge makes the task easier and completes faster so immexiately after building pods, I got a good insurance plan and then proceeded to get knowledge in order to reach my goal faster. I actually did more of research and less of protecting because the time between the sighting of the meteor in the horizon and its impact was  short.\n\nImmediately the game started, I went for an insurance plan to give the community some level of coverage. I alternated between research and protecting because I needed to balance both in order to achieve my goal.\n\nI played the game more than once and I,realised  the mistake I made was that not properly balancing my options lead to failure to complete the given task.\n\nThe most important thing I learnt from the game was the power of insurance. I realised that the cost of repairs and upgrading was far more cheaper with a goood insurance plan. \n\nIn the game itself, I would give more time to complete each level and make the acquisition of protection bars faster. In the area where I live in, I would emphasis the benefits ofiinsurance and help my neighbours get a good insurance plan for their properties."

I have played similar games in the past in which I was required to build cities and deal with a lot of administration. Instead of comets, there would be other natural disasters or war or famine and I would be required to counter the effects of those. There would be limitless choices as to how one could manage the land and the people. \nHowever, for this game, it turns out it took me three turns to reach level three and I fell a minute step behind what it required to reach level 4. The main constraint overall was the money. The money does not accumulate fast and development and upgrades require subsequently larger amounts of money. I was tempted to build and upgrade and ignore the insurance and protection the first time I played. Lets say, I didn't do too good. I realised it is much better to prevent damage than to repair as it just used up much more money and moreover, time was another constraint. At the end of level 3, I ran out of time twice. Hence, I made sure that the amount of damage was negligible or did not occur at all. By level three it was also more difficult to get the 75% insurance coverage as most of the funds were tied into upgrading. So it was a tradeoff for development versus insurance. The next time round that I play, I think I will prioritise insurance to upgrades and see what happens.\nIf I were to develop a newer version, I would insert agricultural aspect to it. It would become more challenging as there would now be a tradeoff between shelter and food. As Maslow's hierarchy puts it, the fundamental need of humans is shelter and food security. It would be interesting to see how gamers would balance between the two most important aspects of life...save the home? or save the food? If both of these factors are not balanced, human cannot go up to the next levels in which they develop as a society and progress in knowledge and technology. Subsistence living can only be upgraded if there basic factors are dealt with. The developing countries are stuck in this viscous cycle of basic needs and only by risk taking and management will they be able to break it."

Overall I think that this reflection is comprehensive, clear and well written.\n\nAs for the negatives, I think tradeoffs between the different game’s options were overlooked a bit. More evaluation and analyses of tradeoffs between risk management and development, as well as those of different risk management types might be included. It could be stated, for example, that heavy investment in protection eliminated the need of high research and insurance expenditures. It should also be highlighted that high protection made coping easier, as in most cases crisis was avoided. Fewer damages then led to more money available to invest in further development and enabled to hit the development target. I think that paying a bit more attention to all risk management techniques, rather than just protection, could make this reflection even better.\n",

After aquiring new knowledge throughout the course we exercite our knowledge by applying the best techniques in risk management to our land Aloria.\n\nOne of the things that I think it's very interesting is the bar that measures the development and the levels that allows us to win the game by developing our pods. This simple thing is very important because it reminds us our main goal is the development and not the shocks themselves. Our goal is not to avoid the damages but to develop through the shocks. Development in the game has two basic componentes just as in reality: quality and quantity (of the pods) which we must manage in order to go further in the game because they both require time and diferent amounts of money.\n\nThen we have three factores when a meteor enters our orbit that are very interesting and that became our main difficulty: Research; Insurance and Prevention. We must decide, we must choose wisely in order to avoid the damage but at the same time we must continue to develop our land, that is the real challenge: to manage all the resources we have wisely in order to develop more and more. I think if we only had to defend or protect Aloria it would be an easy task, the problem here is that we must protect but at the same time we must develop it and as usual time and money are always missing when we need them the most.\n\nThe shock is defined by three diferente factors when the meteor hits: Severity of the meteor; Probability of hitting Aloria and Research, the amount of research we get defines the time we have after the impact to react to the shock and diminuish eventual damage. We must manage and use this three factors in order to decrease the impact in our development.\n\nThe insurance has three modalitys: by a small amount of many we get a cover of 33% of the costs, by a medium amount of Money we get a cover of 50% of costs and by a big amount  we get a cover of 75% of costs. However we don't want to have to use the insurance because even with the best insurance our development suffers a lot if we get hit by a meteor and don't have adequate protection.\n\nThe elevation is the best way to protect our land and our development however it's also the most expensive and requires more time than all the others but in my opinion it's worth it.\n\nAfter playing this game a number of times I've tried diferent strategies however besides the strategy, luck played an important role just like in reality where we cannot guess some variable factors.\n\nJust like in real life we have to start the elevation (the preparation) in the beggining of level one, in the beggining, before we get the chance to be hit by a meteor and the first meteors may fail to cause any damage however it is the most important thing in the future as the game goes on.\n\nThe only thing I would add to this game would be habitants because their reactions also matter a lot in reality and we need to manage them too.\n\nAs so, this game is a simple replica of reality that allows us to practice and aquire practic knowledge about risk management."

The player has to manage the risk of the severity, likelihood and the timing of the damage happening. All this of course while staying on a tight budget as well as a steep goal to reach in terms of the development to successfully complete the level. \nThe player has to make choices as to what to prioritize: Knowledge of the meteors, Insurance, Safety, Opportunity of developing the establishments. Of course there had to be trade-offs for being able to finish the levels, and I played the game multiple times to find out the best approach to complete the task.\n\nInitially I thought before the meteors hit me, I would build as many pods as possible and in their basic state without upgrades, My next priority was to keep an eye on the meteors severity and likelihood but not accumulate the knowledge but to focus on improving my safety by holding the protection bar. I also purchased the most comprehensive insurance available.\n\nI quickly found out this wasn't the best method to avert the danger and at the same time develop my habitat successfully.\nNext I tried out building a solitary pod, buy the same insurance as before, but this time raise my protection to 1 bar  only and then get the knowledge about meteor to 2 bars. Then upgrade my pod as funds are becoming available. If meteor isn't likely to hit me (likelihood is not higher than 3 bars). Then I would rather improve my protection than get more knowledge about the risk.\n\nThis method didn't work out as well as I would have thought, finally I decided to limit my pods to 3, get 50% insurance coverage, and balance my time and money between developing the 3 pods and improving my protection to 2 bars, and then get as much knowledge as possible for the more severe meteors. The preparation for risk initially didn't affect my pods development much as I focused more on development and less on the meteors. But my final methodology meant I had to slow down on development a little and focus on risk management to get my habitat to the highest level of development in the end (after the meteors hitting me and the time running out).\n\nIf I was tasked to change or add one thing, I would change the way the protection bar works, I would make it more practical / meaningful than having the player to just click and hold it or the way \"make the connections\" to improve safety works. \n\nOverall I think the game did in a simple, fun and an imaginative way ingrain the fundamentals of risk management in me. Kudos to the developers! \n"

A risk in this game are the comets that strike the planet and cause a damage to the pods and hinder the development of the planet. Every comet had a severity and chance of hit. The longer we research a comet the more accurate the predictions become. In the game we were also able to insure against shocks and  increase a protection. When I played the game a researched only those comets that had at least 50% of chance of hit in order not to waste time, as it was impossible to research all comets. I didn't use insurance as it covered max of 75% of repairing cost and after building and upgrading most of the pods it was very expensive to pay even 25% percent of the cost and it was hard to fullfil the development bar again. So, I increased protection and only when it was necessary (when there was a large chance for the comet to hit). I played the game once and reached level 7. I would not do anything differently. I received an example of how risk management techniques are used in real life and within real communities. In order for this game to be more realistic and interesting, i recomend to developers to create some different kinds of natural disasters and different kinds of protection against them."

In the second replay I started to thinking the ideas from the videos and how closely were related to the game. I was starting to think the techniques for identification, assessment, and prioritization of the risk even in this simple form of knowledge, protection and insurance. In the game I had to make decisions with these limited dollar resources in order to protect my \"town\" from the imminent threats and even take up some risks to help me co up better in the next level. From the start of the game is obvious that is imposible to invest in all three options and if you try to invest in all you will get stucked in the midle by having no clear strategy and you wont be able to move forward. Sometimes you had to ignore one or even two of the strategies with the hope that only one will be adequate to make through. Also sometimes I was forced not to upgrade my buildings in orfer to buy insurance because a theat of the comet crush was huge, so this possibility delayed my development.\n\nAs I mentioned before I played the game two times. The first time I made a big mistake in trying to invest in all three. A really bad option with the limited resources, which it neither allow me to upgrade my buildings (knowledge) nor provide me adequate protection and I was forced to move on and buy insurance. The first round was a failure from which I was able to learn that we can not protect everything as I was imagined before the class even in an oversimplistic \"town\" but we have to prioritize the dangers and face them one by one. We need to have a clear strategy and invest in one, otherwise we will make \"a whole in the water\".\n\nRegarding the change that we have to add I would definetly choose the human element, because the way people think and act many times force leaders to alter or even change completly their strategy even it is the correct one and overall will be the most benefitial for the community. The impresions that people hold and their reactions have made current states different from each other even if they had really close mind sets."

It represented the basic instinct of taking risk, let me say how, it takes guts to clear your balance to set up the base camps, but the more difficult it gets to protect them, so there is a simple trade off between the ability to take the risk and go ahead with the construction of the camps or else decide judiciously the direction of the attack previously and build the camps at the strategic places . Therefore, no doubt there is always a human desire to be protected , but it comes with a cost, either one needs to take the risk or be safe , this is the general misconception , but it should be in the human nature to have a balance between the two, he/she should take calculated risk (like done in the game), because nobody wants to be out of the game in a single round :). So, effective risk taking strategy comes with effective planning of your ideas and concepts. The game taught this thing very nicely, and i really appreciate it for giving me the insight into the core of the risk strategies. If i played it again i would plan more carefully when to build the camps and allocate the budget tactfully.If i need to modify one thing in the game, i would add more adversary conditions with each passing level , like addition of more attacks, however at the same time i shall include some strong mechanisms to combat those, but they shall come with a price. This addition shall reflect the decision making capacity of a manager at the time of heavy disturbance, and by taking a small risk he/she can go upto the last level, but by avoiding some thing it would be harmful for them, and they shall introspect their decision later on."

I thought I had no chance but quit this course feeling devasted on Sunday afternoon.  I cheered  myself up again on Momday to challenge the game again and did win a few levels of the game. As I played the game, I began realizing the roles of risk management in the game. I think the major role of risk management is to first watch out the risk coming and to analyize the fast moving risk throughly to prepare for the some protection measures so as to minimize the negative impact of the risk. After investigating the characters of the approaching risk, I started thinking about the best possible options of what to do to protect the village from the impact. I should decide wheather a severity of the risk or the chance of the hitting is considered first to make a plan for the coming risks. I thought I should give higher priority to the severity of the risk because the more sever the bad impact of the risk is the the more damage the risk create though the chance are rare. I could not trade off knowledge and protection for insurance only because we could leastly depend upon the insurance if we would have enough knowledge and protection tools for the risk at hand.  I believe the preparation for risk can affect the development instanly because we can predict the damage the risk may incur under the worst situation if we can fully prepare for the risk. I can definitely say a stich in time saves nien whileconsidering risk management. "

You learn how to avoid losses and negative impacts by “investing” in research and in insurance alternatives. These two key issues are relevant for surviving.\nIn a new version of the game I will suggest to add the participation of public institutions, international community, the enterprise sector, the financial system and the households in the design of strategies to a better risk management. For example adding the option of creating jobs or creating a board to research and articulate policies and roles for risk management will give the game new choices for coping and resilience.

Later I realized that Knowledge (research, probability, impact) and preparation allowed me to make better choices with respect to damage control and repair. Which gave me a better since of the type of insurance was best to protect the community. I found that managing growth while constantly preparing for the next catastrophe was a daunting task. These were many takeoffs that had the be considered while managing risks. For instance, before a catastrophic event, preparation had to be made to make sure necessary elevation was applied, which delayed the repair of already damaged pods, This also slowed growth and development of new pods. Value of pods, cost and insurance and probability of risk, all had to be considered at the same time in order to make the most cost effective decision, while focusing on the heath and growth of the community."

For anyone to effectively manage it, there has to be a trade-off between protection, research and insurance. None of these methods can work in isolation. All risks have to be researched and identified and then prioritized according to the probability of occurrence and severity of impact. Preparation of risk affected development in that I could not start managing risk before starting any development as there is no risk. However, after development, I spread out my developments so that there is no systematic risk as well as put up few developments that I could sufficiently cover using the insurance. However, for the developments that were hit and damaged, it required additional resources to restore them to the position there were in before. This also affected the level of protection to the whole development. Where there was damage to the pods, the protection that I had accumulated reduced making the developments more vulnerable even after putting in resources to protect them. However, there more developments I put up, the better it was to cope with the risks as the cluster would enable collective coping mechanism to any risk encountered.\nI played the game more than once and therefore I was able to learn that there needs to be a tradeoff between knowledge, protection and insurance for effective risk management. Moreover, for each aspect of risk management, I need to have adequate resources not only for development, but also for employment of effective risk management strategies. Moreover, different risks have to be handled differently as they come with different levels of impact and severity. Prioritization has to be done so as not to concentrate resources on a risk that although had a high level of severity, the probability of occurrence was very low while putting little effort in management of a risk whose level of severity was low but the probability of occurrence was very high.\nI would change management of risk through protection. In the game, the level of protection can only be increased but not reduced by an individual. This is because, in cases here there is no need of a lot of protection, and resources can be diverted from there to insurance or knowledge. This is so that, there are no resources that are underutilized which could have been properly utilized to manage the risks.\n\n"

However this was the most expensive as well.

This freed up resources for devloping the pods.

One and only educated Village Agriculture graduate convinced Village people to construct a CHECK DAM in mountainous stream by own effort without assistance from Government. Check Dam protected  crop  from damage due to irregular rainfall. Installation of solar Panel solved lighting problem\nIf we unite and share our limited resources for  common cause, We can avoid risk for common benefit"

It seemed knowledge was the best way to increase your amount of monetary reserves and at the same time saving further development of the pods until there were only low risk comets in the atmosphere. Also you should not over buy insurance. At the lower levels it seemed you only needed the second level of insurance until the higher risk comets came and you developed your pods more then you needed the third level of insurance. I think that one issue that the game did not capture and an issue I have frequently confronted when I have been involved in risk management decisions in the New York City area is that certain areas and certain populations are more vulnerable to natural disasters than others and often when you only have a certain amount of money to allocate to all areas of the City you need to prioritize.Generally, the low lying areas (more prone to flooding) and also the poor, elderly or disabled are where resources are most needed. I think the game treated all the developments as though they all had the same risk even though some were closer to the water's edge than others and in that instance you might expect those properties to be more vulnerable.You also need to somehow be able to evaluate which actions will have the most impact and that may have been what was missing in the game. For instance, if had taken my pods to the next level of development as soon as I had enough money, would that have sped my rate of return on my investment and then maybe I would have been able to be better protected? Or if I had distributed flyers to all the residents of Allora about how to prepare for disasters (preparation at their own expense to some extent) and where to evacuate to in the event a disaster hits should that have raised to score as well? Communication is often an inexpensive form of risk mitigation that cities can undertake and I think it would have been helpful if the game focused on that aspect a little more. For instance, many neighborhoods and cities in the New York region have distributed flyers that describe what type of things people need to have on hand in order to be prepared for a natural disaster and also communicated the cities' central emergency centers' locations and where to register with the fire department in the event you need assistance in evacuation which the fire department has said has been an enormous help. Overall I think it was helpful in getting the general concepts of risk management across (preparation, protection and insurance) but I would have like to have seen the repercussions of my decisions in more detail and more clearly. I think the ideas relating to prioritization and communication in relation to risk management would have been helpful to see in more detail."

I played the game twice and there were different strategies that were adopted. In my first attempt, the main aim was to build the communities as quickly as possible. I thought that having more communities would help in agility, cooperation and sharing of resources when comets struck the planet. But at the same time, I bought the insurance that offered the least protection, because the first comet that came near had a low probability of hitting. But the strategy back-fired in the second level of the game because I had spread my resources too thin by starting too many cells and had to incur high damage costs for each of the communities because of low insurance. This caused the failure to move from Level 2 to Level 3. While developmental activity was on, the damages caused the future potential of development because significant resources were spent on repairs and damages and the threat of another comet ruining the new developmental activities did not encourage any new developments. As a result the Level 2 failure could be blamed on inadequate planning, preparations for comet strikes and spreading the resources too thin. The second attempt involved ploughing back the learning from the first attempt. This time, the game was played with a phase-wise expansion of communities and taking the highest insurance available. Also, the elevation option was exercised, which had been ignored in the earlier attempt. All this helped in crossing the second level, but the third level again caused problems to the developmental activities. Also, the comets were regularly monitored to check for the probability of strike and preparations were made accordingly. \nThe main learning from the game were that insurance would help mitigate the damage that is caused because of risks that are uncertain and are beyond the control. The lower damage costs would save the resources that could be exploited for better opportunities. Apart from this, proper planning and preparedness helps build resilience, which otherwise could cause chaos. Communities that can share resources and cooperate have an edge at surviving calamities. \nIn the game, it was observed that the comets struck at the same intervals and at the same intensity when the game was played twice. If given a task to recreate the game, I would design it in a manner that would make the sequence and the intensity of the comets striking a random event, so that the uncertainty in the game can be maintained.\n"

The game “Risk Horizon” demonstrates the four aspects of risk management as described in the World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development.  The four aspects are knowledge, insurance, protection and coping, which in the game have to be in balance with investment for economic development.  As I played the game, I bought full insurance, which seemed inexpensive in relation to its benefits.  I increased protection to the level of the highest threat, when it was possible to do so without undermining my economic growth.  As for knowledge, I prioritized the most dangerous of the meteorites.  What was difficult for me was finding the balance between protection and economic development.  In the short term, protection reduced the rate of economic development of my small country, but it allowed me to avoid the drastic costs of large scale disasters.  The second time I played, I tried to be a little less cautious, and although I advance further in the game, it turns out I still invested too much in protection and ended up failing.  The lesson I learnt was that taking too little risk was at the end a larger danger than the risks I had avoided, as I lost the opportunities to promote progress.  \n \nI enjoyed the game, although if I could change one thing in the game, it would be the coping mechanism.  I believe that although coping is linked to knowledge of the threats, effective coping requires preparation before a disaster occurs, and that the game could reflect this with a series of activities such as organizing, awareness raising and planning that would make the coping activities more effective later.  The player would have to choose between using their time for gaining knowledge or for preparing the communities.\n\n“Risk Horizon” allowed me to reflect on the diverse benefits of knowledge, insurance, protection and coping to risk management, and my failure led me recognize the lost opportunities that occur when we invest too much in risk reduction. I look forward to a more complex game in the future that includes, at least, a mechanism to prepare communities to be able to better cope in disaster situations."

In the game we had the choice of buying insurance which was supposed to help deal with the consequences of the disaster (in this case the meteor shower), as well as the raising of the floor level, which was supposed to help with preparation for the said risk. In this sense we had been provided with tools to manage risk by preparing in advance and coping with damage after disaster struck. The last element of risk management is collaboration at the community and other levels to deal with contingency, risk mitigation and coping mechanisms. This was also provided as a tool in the form of 'making connections' in the game. These three elements/tools were packaged with 'research', which was essentially the use of experience and forecasting to predict the occurrence of the disaster to improve preparedness and maintain control of the situation. I found that knowing the level of severity in advance allowed me to decide by how much I needed to raise the floor level. This element also mimicked real life quite well because information about the meteor shower got more accurate with time, which is true of all disaster forecasting. This created a very real and immediate trade-off between the amount of time I could spend researching the meteor and the amount of time I could spend between doing other things like raising the floor level for disaster preparation, building more assets (pods) and upgrading existing pods to increase wealth. What I learned over time was how to improve the balance between the time and energy I could allot to each of these things. I also understood the importance of renewing insurance over time and making internal connections. If I was developing the game and was allowed to make a change, then I would probably introduce an 'investment tool' where I could invest in either better researching technology or better and more expensive pods. That would bring out the trade-out between wealth generation and protections more vividly."

Because when we learn new information about the definition and effects of our risky position, also we can basically learn the ways of the protection from the risky position and learn clearly the ways and effects of the insurance, which is a kind of an ex post protection, on risk.

There is no way the government of a country will not bear part of the cost of putting damaged structures into place after any possible attack, even if the cost is minimal, but considerable amount of percentage was insured which makes the building affordable for the country, because the cost implication that the country would bear in repairing the damaged properties will be minimal and also affordable.\nThe consciousness of the risk and also its knowledge also prepared the player of the game (government in term of country/society) to put adequate preventive measures in place and this in a no minimal way sometimes helps to prevent the attack from destroying properties (shock).

The used choices prevent damages to development and compensate the losses  if something bad happens. When there is little risk, the process of development should be faster. All kinds of preparation should be applied in this game to succeed. By using only one of them, the probability of loss will increase. So, a combination of the available choices should be used proportionately. Depending on the situation the way of preparation is different; for example if the threat is very severe and you do not have time to increase protection, you should use insurance.The more protected you are, the less damage you will suffer and the more time you may have to get ready to confront the risks.

Whether this concept is applied to a hypothetical case or a large recurring problem, risk management is a very important tool to offer protection and to foster innovation. The first step to aid decision-making in the face of a risk is knowledge. With its help, it is easier to deduce how much protection and insurance to spend on in times of a negative shock. Finally, how a society copes with such a disaster after it has occurred also contributes to risk management.\n\tKnowledge about a risk that leaves an impact on a society is the primary and often, the most important step in preparing. If the risk is one that impacts the society negatively, then understanding the outcomes can be done through mathematical simulations and calculations or comparing with similar, previous cases. If the risk may result in aiding the society in which it occurs, it is equally important to understand how best to make use of this, so that the society can prosper as much as it feasibly makes sense to. In the game, knowledge about the comets is the first step to preparation and greatly benefits the overall outcome. Once knowledge has been acquired, the amount to spend for protection and insurance needs to be figured out. During the game, protection and insurance are synergistic on the whole. However, I found that protection is often preferred to insurance in this case. Appropriately protecting the land reduces the amount of coping necessary after the comet. That being said, insurance is still necessary; more risks could be taken to improve upon the land if it was insured. \n\tOnce the three mechanisms affecting risk management are understood about a specific comet situation and preparation is in place, it may be feasible to allow the town to grow. Taking a positive risk is just as important in this game because it allows for more income, which can in turn be used to protect and insure it from larger disasters. Therefore, a lot of times, a trade-off may be necessary. If the comet’s chance of hit and damage caused is low, then it makes more sense to spend funds on expanding the town, and vice versa. In the worst case, when a disaster hits and results in damage, community support is essential to rebuilding what is affected, especially if the town does not have that much funding for reparation costs. \nAfter my first effort playing the game, I changed my strategy to allow for a protection that is more general and can protect many different shocks, as opposed to preparing specifically for a single shock. With the limited funding, this turned out to be more effective and efficient in the management of resources available. If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to acquire better knowledge about the comets to be able to make even smarter decisions regarding expenditure on protection and insurance."

The game calls for thinking strategically i.e balancing between preparing for these inevitable risks and investing in community development on the one hand and also thinking about the different tools one can deploy to confront these risks on the other hand. \nI often more than not started each level with Insurance, as one progressed, the insurance policies I chose depended largely on how much was available with the need to have small funds on hand for the inevitable repairs coming a distant second in my consideration. More funds tended to be made available if one leads off with purchasing an insurance policy option which I then channeled to properties. Property development was then done and continuously improved as opportunities presented themselves. Research was a sine-qua-non at every opportunity while protecting (raising the island) often came after the green meter is filled. In preparing for inevitable risks, I often slowed new developments but consolidated on existing community awareness relationships often by raising and holding the button on the lower right briefly and leaving it before the green on the upper left completely turns red. Toggling this button intermittently seemed to help occasionally.\n\nThe game could be addictive though, but one learned to thread the fine line between risk preparation and developing ones community which is quite a thrilling challenge once you get in the game. Spend too much on building and upgrading pods and you will be exposed to comets when they hit. Any damage sustained from comets hinders progress and often means rebuilding at great costs. On the other hand, spending too much on preparing for risks leaves one with not enough money to develop the community sufficiently to make it to another level. \nOne simple thing I would want added is building of flood barrier or levees, at a cost of course, as well as underground bunker housing. The former greatly reduces flood devastation while the latter reduces casualties in the case of direct comet strikes (given advance warning through research, people can be directed to such shelters in time before the comets or floods hit). This option should be made available even from the start of the game so that we can build from the ground up."

Risk management is an essential tool for development that is exposed to many risks, and an inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals. The situation\nis constantly changing, and with change comes uncertainty. We do not exactly know if the disaster hits or not. There is always a chance factor. We must decide the proper balance between taking on risk and preparing for it, or\nacting only after a shock has occurred. The choice of how much risk to take on will be affected by a trade-off between risk and return—by reducing the riskiness of the development, we may also diminish the potential return we can\nget. Risk management can enhance development, allowing us both to decrease the risk we face in the game and to improve return. We have three options for risk management:\n1) Research (Knowledge), 2) Insurance and 3) Protection. To manage the risk these are the tools. Through research we get the information regarding severity and chance of shock. It helps us in making choice between development,\ninsurance and protection. Sometimes, it is seen that on account of economic constraints we make trade-off between protection and insurance. With less protection, damage occurs. But insurance will cover the cost of repairing. Thus\nwe can transfer the risk. Sometimes development becomes riskier if proper protection is not taken. Investment in preparation for risk mitigation means less investment in development, but the decision pays dividend in the long run.\nDisaster is mismanagement of development, while risk management of development is risk aversion. It is strategic planning in the game where we have some options from which we have to make our choice to get the maximum benefit. "

Comets that flew in from the sky and infrastructure development were some of the few portfolios to consider. Poor management of these risks would certainly develop inevitable crises on the horizon.\nProperly managing such risk saw the horizon escape all the possible crises, but rather turning them into opportunities. Utilizing these opportunities contributed to the development and accumulation of wealth. Properly acquiring knowledge on the comets that threatened the horizon through research provided lots of information TO ENHANCE BETTER preparation thereby increasing resilience and protection against the shocks.\nPlaying the game improved my understanding on the importance of knowledge acquisition in solving problems. Effective research on potential shocks solves about 40% of the possible cost in damage that a community could possibly suffer from any risk. In the game I realized a possibility to develop more protection against threats after researching and obtaining confirming information on the approaching risk. I could conserve lots of resources and also raise the appropriate protection in required measurement making necessary preparation ahead of the threat.\nProper and effective networking was another way of minimizing the weight of crises. It is very important to act fast and accurately in other to beat the effects of all shocks. There are some threats that appear abruptly leaving the horizon with little time to make proper preparations. The good thing about this type of development is the ability to test the strengths of whatever systems set in place to counter any shock that appears with such a pace. From playing the game and progressing through the levels, I had total control with a good insurance plan and adequate funds to raise protection against such shocks only after suffering similar threats at the previous levels. This strength was only identified when I was able to cope with the shocks received from the threats already encountered.  \nDevelopment was affected in lots of ways throughout my attempts to lessen the impacts of the incoming shocks. There was an immediate loss in resources but an increase in revenue after threats are dealt with from claims in the insurance packages purchased. There were instances where I began to construct new structures even when I knew greater shocks were advancing at faster rate. That management approach was entirely wrong since protection was not heightened due to the absence of resources. It was only appropriate for me to continue with my development goals only when I had built great resilience through proper research and heightened protective structures backed with good insurance packages. It is always better to focus on development when better protective schemes are instituted to cater for any incoming shock.\nThe game has a very good way of introducing any player into carefully managing risks whiles improving on developmental plans. But I I think the introduction of comets made it an unlikely threat to consider. Situations presented in the course of playing the game are real and they all reflect on real issues in our everyday activities. In choosing a threat for such a game, I will suggest an everyday environmental threat like storms, tsunami, hurricane and earthquakes be presented. In doing so the player gets to relate more with the possibility of facing the threat seen. One threat that will perfectly fit into that of my community is rainstorms. Rain storms are a major to my community. Many houses are destroyed when we are visited with such threats. A lot are rendered homeless and lots of households are thrown into poverty. \n"

It is actually very difficult to finance both development and risk reduction measures at the same time. On the one hand risk reduction measures are costly and have to be financed with resources that are needed for development measures as well. Nevertheless, they are indispensable as development is very likely to be destroyed if hazards hit the community and cause widespread damage. At the same time, community leaders do not only have to decide whether to invest in development or in risk reduction measures. They also have to decide with risk reduction measures to chose. So primarily, they have to decide whether to invest in risk transfer measures or in protection measures. The game actually showed how difficult it is to decide whether to invest in one or the other. In the face of unknown risks this decision is actually hard to take. Nevertheless, the game is even simpler than the reality. In reality, risk managers have to prepare for a multitude of different risk and they have to prepare for these risks in different ways. In the game, insurance and protection measures can be taken for \"risk\" in general. In reality, the scarce resources have to be divided in order to prepare for health risks, risks from natural hazards... As well, in reality, complexity is also increased by the challenge of reaching a certain level of social equality and inclusive growths. As such, \"riskhorizon\" can be regarded as a game illustrating very well certain aspects of challenges faced in the real world of today."

Role of risk management is to design a suitable dynamic strategy for efficient allocation of available resources to achieve milestones with time limitation. I chose to research about falling comets before their impact well in advance and chose protection over insurance early in the game. I got protection to 3 levels before substantial development. I research falling comets with more severity than the protection I had. Then I tried to build communities after impact of comets to minimize their impact of development and progress bar. Preparation for risk consumes resources which otherwise could have been used for development immediately but protects harm imposes by comets later. Therefore, a find balance is needed between protection and development."

Thus, the analysis of preparing against risks also requires more funds was truly experienced. What also happened was the fact that I was left waiting for more funds on numerous occasions to upgrade my pods. Each level of up-gradation gave out a steep climb in the cost factor and It was not immediately in my budget.

Since we cannot avoid risk, we\ncan brace ourselves up to manage it! Throughout the game, I learnt that\nmanaging for risk is not just important, but wise. As I played the game, I found\nit difficult to maintain a balance between management of my community’s risk\nand maintaining a healthy protection of my community at the same time. It seemed\na great challenge and brought to my mind that often times the issues we see as\nso easy for society to handle are much more hectic and expensive. Nevertheless,\nwe cannot afford to sit quietly and watch as the threat of risks always looms\naround us. From hunger to poor health; to natural disasters; to lack of access\nto education and several other calamitous issues, the game teaches us that the\nonly remedy to manage risk is to research, prepare, protect and in the case\nwhere we are hit my disaster, we rebuild.

However once income began to come through, better and more development was taken like upgrading to better technology which explains that more investment in infrastructure resulted in better technology which in turn resulted in people being affected a lot. Even when affected, repairs and maintenance became less expensive because of the availability of insurance.

So what i did is built three units in the top and bottom and left the center empty, and upgraded them as soon as i could. this allowed me sufficient resources to rebuild.\n\nA critique on this case is that it does not simulate real life situations, who would invest in such a high-risk environment? Furthermore, the insurance compensation was 3-times as much as a the premium in each situation, and we know that real life does not work like that. The game illustrates the key messages, however it could've been designed to be closer to real life situations. Plus, research does not always give you detailed information about the risks, particularly systemic and devastating risks the report and the MOOC discusses. Just my two cents. Cheers. "

The first task was, in fact, the identification of risks and then the identification of a proper path for development. Building pods, imho, was necessary but they were too exposed to comets and floods, so the had to be upgraded with the best budding techniques, but they had to be insured, too. Not having much money I thought that a less than 50% insurance could do better that no one at all. Also research on the comets and uplifting the ground of the pods were important, even if it came with a cost. That is why I succeeded best when I did not build as many pods as there could be fitted in the area. \n\nI had some difficulty in playing the game, because on the first time there was no button for insurance and on the last one I could not upgrade any building, but apart from these bugs (or maybe it was my fault, who knows) I could see that the way it went in the best way it was when I built only three pods, developing them through the whole game. I couldn't get very far anyway, but I had the time to start another game I would try to get the insurance from an early stage, maybe the cheapest one, and to build just four pods. Anyway I am afraid that part of the game was to be played without much thinking, because the transposition from getting educated ideas to clicking on pictures lost something and I was really belied in having to play this after hearing the cases used as examples in the videos.   \n\nI think the best part of this game was the net of protection, but I found it too strange, because some part of it started in places with no pods. I think that an improvement in the game could be building community around the pods, seen as an aggregator for people as well as a form of economic development. I would like to see a closer connection from community (and their deeds) to risk management efforts.\nThe idea of a distant planet, as I said, proved good to introduce the problem of starting risk management form zero, but the aim of the game could be understood better than it was if only there had been a more comprehensible connection between the actions of the player and the turning to green of that sort of thermometer, especially when there was no money, no comets and nothing to do to influence pods or insurance for longer than a minute.    \n\n"

However, I was pleased that at the end of each game there were detailed directions showing the missed opportunities to be applied to cope with the chock when I was about to restart the game. \nAt some point it was very difficult to anticipate the hit of the comets as they were unstoppable. It was very frustrating when the percentage of the damage was very high and I could not see how to correct and alleviate them. Furthermore, sometimes it has been shown that there is a high chance of hit, but there was not hit and vice versa. \nI believe risk management is very difficult and it requires a careful preparation where many actors are involved and they can share expertise and responsibilities. I would say that the risk management combines at the same time cautious research and repeated scenarios and it requires a lot of energy and resources. From the readings and through the game I see that it is very difficult to put together necessary puzzles capable of preventing the disasters and coping effectively with them during the recovery period.  \nFurthermore, in this case of comets I think researchers may use appropriate technology to avoid their hits and consequently their damages. I am very impressed that in theory I thought that risk management is easily feasible, but through the game it is very hard and maybe the expected results might be also disappointing in case of real disasters when there were low chances of probability to happen. \nFinally, though I have been confused by the game I learn a lot of things that preparation is very important to help cope with disasters. If I had to change something when I take in consideration where I live I would have given a scenario of a storm. Then risk management may be understandable in theory but when it comes to put all puzzles together and also coping with damages it requires a detailed combination of many things and an involvement of many actors."

I totally agree with the writer that in real life risk management, there is no such thing as one omnipotent \"luminator\" who does literally everything. Indeed it should be a team work, a joined up endeavor from various entities at varying levels. I bet in real life, there will be lots of coordination failures in execution as well. On the other hand, I found the game reflection to be a little too concise, too general from time to time. I think it is manly due to the writer's first language is not English. It could have been slight better if the one talked about some other aspects in the game. Link between preparation and coping is a good example. One may think one either prepare or cope with risk but the game showed that good preparation almost always lead to good coping. Also good preparation almost always lead to minimal burden and time required for swift recovery. One could have talked more about different components in risk management depicted in the game: \"Protection\" illustrated as act of lifting the island. \"Insurance\" to complement relatively slow \"Protection\" building. Pros and cons of different options as well as constantly changing property of risk together make the job of risk management challenging, I think.

This prevented development from being set back more than it otherwise would be. In turn, this allowed the development to move forward at a higher pace by saving money and time on repairs. With development moving forward at a higher pace more resources (money) was produced, which I automatically used for new pods or upgardes to the pods already in existence. The choices and trade - offs I made while playing the game included: (i) deciding which of the comets to observe, (ii) whether to observe a comet or continue building/upgrading pods, buy insurance or increase protection; (iii) buy insurance or increase protection. Preparation for risk alleviated the amount of damage caused by comets or in come instances fully eliminated it. As a result, I was able to spend more time and resources on adding incremental development versus spending those two precious resources on returning development to the state it was already in before the damage."

One of the features that would make the game more realistic would be to not take the whole amount that is due for building or upgrading right after you've selected it, but gradually. It would be more realistic to be asked for an initial investment, that would be a portion of the total cost, and then the balance to be taken as the building progresses.

By raising the island, I felt like I was receiving the best benefit at the lowest cost (likely because there was no cost specifically outlined for that action, only a slow depletion of your funds. Meanwhile, there was a definite cost associated with upgrading the pods or with buying insurance. In the end, I think I purchased too little insurance because of the prices. The 33 percent coverage felt reasonable, but the more desirable 75 percent was prohibitively expensive as I expanded my pods. I grew the area too quickly without purchasing the proper coverage.

The preparation for the disasters involved also different phases, first researching on how probable and how severe would a comet hit be; second deciding upon lifting the island to protect the pods according to that impact equation; and third, purchasing an insurance to make reconstruction cheaper. It is interesting to see how although preparation for risk was achieved by \"lifting\" the island for protection, this measure reduced notoriously how well the \"development bar\" performed. Such a decision in the game gives me a very clear glimpse of what people and governments have to deal with when they seem not to make the \"obvious\" decisions of remaining on safe zones-- this is, focusing too much on protection would not allow enough investment in developing the pods."

Among these, the very important are non availability of food after calamities , loss of life , destruction of infrastructure . Bringing resilience after such disasters is involve many complex procedures which include mobilizing funds for restoration of roads , infrastructure and providing basic amenities to the people . The  exchequer has to source funds not only from within the country and also from other countries that brings long term consequences and adverse effects on the economy to the country . Natural disasters such as tsunami has totally devastated many lives in India and Indonesia . Though the Government has rendered monetary support , it has not ensured restoration of life of all the people affected by tsunami . In india , though it is said the name tsunami is new , history says that it was frequent in early times and historians have recorded the same in many writings and novels. Had the Government had taken due notice of it it would have taken adequate measures to prevent the same. Natural disasters affect the people in different form and level . The severity differ from each disasters ,and the level is also different. The comets in the risk game denotes the different disasters that affects the nation . Each comets has different level of severity , and many disasters like storm many times threaten the nation but do not affect the nation. But , nations are unfortunate many times due to the severe effect of disasters. To mitigate such risks, foreknowledge about the disasters is imminent . The technological advancement helps in identifying the disasters ,its origin , its movement and its destination. Though , this is very hard to predict , science has helped the nation to the maximum extent , and science has also helped in understanding the evil effect of the disasters. Information is vital as it gives the indication about its origin , its movement and the severity . However , the information can be effective only when preparation is made to mitigate the risk . In this game , building and strengthening the vulnerable areas helped to minimise the risk . The maximum risk range in the game went upto 37% . This could have reached the maximum of 100% , had not the community built a safe measures in the vulnerable areas. As was seen in the game , insurance played a great role in resuscitating the affected areas with less resources as financial support came from insurance . Therefore, as vividly presented in the game , information about the disaster , preparation and insurance helped the country manage natural disasters effectively with very minimal loss. "

Comets can hit even though the 'chance of hit' is low. As described in the lecture, behavioral tendencies are seen in such scenarios. Overconfidence can cause huge harm to life and property. Most of the damage can be avoided by raising the height. In risk management, all aspects have to be developed at a constant rate. Even if a single aspect is lagging behind, it will cause major damage. Time management was very necessary. Research levels can be increased while money increases and development is taking place.

So, I mostly relied on insurance and knowledge to advance through the game. Protection by elevation of the island was time consuming and easily lost if there was significant damage from an asteroid hit. Plus, research I feel provided a better option for protection. Preparation for risk helped to rebuild in reasonable amount of time due to the level of advancement of the colony. The more moderate homes were cheaper and took less time to rebuild compared to the more advance ones.

Manelisi mentioned the prerequisites to face the challenges that are access to information-knowledge, thorough research, insurance, protection, to name just a few. Though  Manelisi  pointed out that the game was repeated many times, I am delighted by the emphasis on positive comity members and their full involvement to the success of an effective risk management. Manelisi suggests that the game may allow the use of a telescope and a timer that I think sounds very understandable to allow the preparation and to deal with the disaster. In the reflection of the previous classmate it was mentioned the need of sufficient funds for preparation and coping with the disasters and it was also mentioned in Manelisi’s reflection and I think that these observations may attract the attention of the worldwide  policy makers that there is a need of mutual help to make available necessary funds for risk management of countries throughout the world.

Insurance could be taken out, which covered up to 75% of losses and had to be re bought with every level of the game. It also got more expensive with each level of the game. Secondly\nthere was the chance to investigate the meteorites and their probability of striking and the force they would strike with. Finally you could build protection against the flooding. The level of protection stayed the same after switching to a new level,\nbut it decreased when I got hit. At the beginning I always invested into insurance straight away, so I would be kept save during one level of the game, even if the flood would strike at the very beginning. Then I gradually invested into protection measures. \n\n2.) I played the game a few times and did not really like the research into meteorites function. It did not do very much for me. While I invested heavily into insurance during my first few games, I changed into putting\nmore money into protection later on. I learned that a mix of protective measures and a clever investment into building more houses and upgrading them is probably the best way to succeed in this game. Alwas keeping in mind that this is just a game and that in real life, things would be more complicated and that more factors would have to be considered that would also affect the outcome of a disaster that is likely to happen. \n\n3.) I would try to install a “warning” button, where\nyou would be able to warn beforehand when there is a high probability that a meteorite would strike. Then houses could be safeguarded against this better (that would be an extra thing to add as well – meaning that there would be a button that lets you\n“safeguard” your house before the meteor strikes. It would be cheaper to do so, than to clean up the damage afterwards..). All in all, I was not very impressed with the game, since it is a very simplified version of a disaster that could happen. In real\nlife there would be way more things to take into consideration, but I guess the game showed in simple terms of what disaster management could be about."

I focused on strengthening protection while at the same time developing several plots and securing insurance. Protection, as a preventive measure, was of crucial importance to sustainable development because once a meteor struck, it was already very challenging to restore and take enough time to prepare to deal with subsequent (possible) meteor strikes. In addition, when the level of protection was high, there were only few occasions on which a large sum of money had to be spent repairing damaged plots. I came to realise that the higher the level of protection is the easier it becomes to manage finance and continue development processes. One big challenge I was faced with was that the data telling me about the chances of meteor strikes was not very helpful. Because I did not want to be reliant on chances, I tended to get insurance all the time, which was not quite efficient in terms of financial management."

Investing in greater protection could guarantee that no great harm would come to the population, but this would come at the expense of societal growth.  Therefore there is a trade-off to be made, to improve the lives of citizens investment in protection will not always be maximised.  The role of insurance can help smooth these decisions.  While some protection is needed to ensure that small level damage does not continually hold back society, investing in large scale protection can sometimes be too expensive, and thus insurance can make lighten the load.  However, when adding greater knowledge through research the decision to protect or insure becomes easier.  When you have perfect knowledge of what will happen in future there is no need to take out insurance, unless you will be unable to protect yourself.  This means in this game insurance should only be taken out when it is clear that a real threat exists that you cannot protect yourself against.  The advantage of using protection over insurance is that protection not only helps in the short term, but continues to exist in the medium term, therefore the investment made continues to reap dividends as the game progresses.\n\nThe more I played the game the less insurance I used and the more research I did.  Once you knew what was going to happen you could make accurate investment decisions in protection, and only seek insurance for extreme events.  Thus the more you play the game the more you realise that information is key to making decisions and the risk is taken out of them.  Insurance is only needed when you don't know what will happen, or you can't prevent it.\n\nThe game allows you to obtain too much information too easily, this element of the game can be reduced to make decisions harder and thus more realistic.  Also, while having so few elements makes for simplicity adding in other events, and investment decisions can again complicate he game and thus again make it more realistic.\n\nThe game did remind me of the floods that recently occurred in the South West of England.  There are flood defences there, but they are not designed for extreme events.  So when more rain fell than the defences could cope with the area flooded.  The government has clearly made a decision not to invest in greater protection and allow for insurance to pay for extreme events.  But the damage from these events, doesn't just cost money it sets growth backwards as investment is required to get back to normal.  Therefore protection is always superior to insurance.\n\n"

The game was about to realize the importance of knowledge i.e each comet has different characteristics depending upon the damage it will do and it is not necessary that the comet will surely hit but still we need to get prepare as we never know whether it will impact us and how much it will impact. Protection was done according to different levels. Initially the protection was not hard due to few pods were supposed to be manage. but later in the game as we developed and upgraded more pods, protection of the pods were becoming difficult which suggest that in general that if a country is having more population the risk of damage also increase with it. In case of insurance there was 3 different terms of insurance in each level. In the start i was dependent on insurance more but as i proceed to through next level. rely on insurance decreases because i was more developed in later levels as compare to level 1 so i didn't need to bought expensive insurance terms because i was able to manage repair through my own funds."

In\nmore detail, I had to balance the tradeoff between advancing as a society\nthrough upgrading houses and therewith increasing wealth, versus losing this\nacquired wealth through meteorites crashing down on them. Two major tools were\navailable to manage the risk and prepare for the consequences, with another\ntool being available to forecast the probabilities of occurrence. The first one\nwas the ability to raise the level of the entire and city thus making it less\nreceptive to the flooding that occurred along with the meteor crash. Doing so\nwas at the expense of a lower income as a result of having to pay for\nincreasing the level. It also came at the expense of not being able to observe\nthe incoming meteorites and consequently making it more difficult to assess the\npotential damages. Concluding, tool number one gave protection in case the\nmeteorite crashed down, whereas it took the possibility to acquire knowledge on\nthe severity of it’s impact. Tool number two gave the chance of insurance\nagainst the repairing costs in case of a meteorite impact. Unlike tool number\none, it was a responsive tool, and not a preventive. It would allow for players\nto take risk and try to keep the damages as low as possible, whereas tool\nnumber one would allow players to try to prevent damages through risk taking.\nThe third tool allowed for acquiring knowledge on the severity and likelihood\nof the meteorites crash through observation. Observation however, would prevent\nthe player from taking measures to manage the risk. Thus, there was a tradeoff\nbetween knowledge and information against preparedness and possibility to cope\nwith the disaster. It is worth mentioning though, that there were no monetary\nimplications in observing the meteorite, thus not diminishing the society’s\nwealth."

The role of risk management also involves the management of time resources and the need to be able to juggle multiple activities at once. I made choices to insure heavily although perhaps too much and lost wealth too quickly. I decided not to invest in protection as much as it seemed to take too long to increase. It was more satisfying to build as many pods as quickly as possible. Under time pressure I did not analyse all the information of the risk as thoroughly as I probably should have, I only really glanced at the severity of the risk and not the possibility of it hitting my village. It is important to learn what level of protection is required. Preparing for risk slowed down the building of pods but helped to protect existing ones. Increasing protection from risk was a time-consuming activity. "

Usually it requires to increase the protection level to compete with the severity level of the stars. On the other hand, we need to keep an eye on the development of pods in order to get more money to increase the development level and complete the level goal. I usually make sure the protection level is beyond the severity of the stars, so that nothing will be damaged. It turns out that if the pods get damaged, it will cost a lot of money to repair, and the development level will drop dramatically, sometimes leads to a failure in the level. So I believe it is always a good choice to fulfill the protection level first. I usually don't buy the insurance, as my protection level is high enough to prevent any damage. However, I do experience some time that the severity is so high (such as full severity but I usually just keep the protection level for about 70%-80%) that I get a little bit damage, which always result in failing that level. I usually do not spend much money on research in the severity level of the stars, but just check it very quickly and make sure that my protection level is 20% higher than that.\nI have played several times on this game. At first I didn't get the rules quite well, and I always buy the highest level of insurance and see the pods crush and repair them. I did not raise the protection level at first. I can sometimes get to level 3, but I often end the game very quickly. Then I studied the rule a bit more, and decide to put more effort on the protection level and development of pods. Then I get to pass the level requirement very quickly, and get quite good at it. I shared my experience with my peers, and they all get good results using my strategy. xD"

Personally, I felt that the trade-offs were protection vs insurance (how much to protect vs whether one should buy the most insurance), protection vs upgrading (the cost of protection vs the cost of upgrading), upgrading vs insurance (the cost of upgrading vs the cost of insurance), as well as imperfect information in the game (i.e. whether to protect/upgrade more when there's an impending meteor strike). In my opinion, preparation for risk affected development immediately - for instance, short term costs included the opportunity cost of upgrading/buying new pods. However, in the long term, the insurance/protection paid off in the end.\n\nI played the game more than once - I scored rather badly the first time due to spending \"too much\" on insurance despite copious investments on protection, which then resulted in a lack of development of pods. After losing the game, I changed my strategy by balancing the need to develop and the need to insure. For instance, I tended to focus on protection rather than insurance per se (e.g. I would invest around 33% or 50% on insurance instead of 75% - this helped save money and besides, the amount of protection mitigated the insurance).\n\nI would add (economic) risk management to the game. Living in Singapore, we do not have much natural resources or natural disasters (as depicted by the game). Rather, as Singapore is a major trading hub in Asia, financial or economic risk management should be included. Moreover, I feel that diversification of assets can be included in the game (i.e. other than pods, perhaps there could be other forms of \"development\" with different \"resilient indexes\" to meteor strikes)."

As for preparation it affected development immediately in the sense that one wasted resources in preparation and retarded a bit development but it greatly paid off on later stages of development where when adverse situations occurred you didn’t suffer a great drawback in development because you were better prepared for the unfortunate events. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                        \n2.\tAfter the first time I paid more careful attention to the imminent risks and mitigation resources available than just growth and development. The main things I learned was that imminent risks are always present and you need to take them in account if you want to prosper without huge setbacks. A combination of Insurance, Protection (resilience) and Research (knowledge of surroundings, cyclical risks and risks in general) is therefore essential, and even so this cannot avoid negative events of occurring, so adding to this elements a swift and quick response when shocks occur linked to coordination of the different sectors of an economy can greatly minimize the impacts of negative shocks and make recovery more quick. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n3.\tThe game captures and addresses some relevant aspects of risk management such as coordination in the community, uncertainty, myopia (if you don’t have a long-term perspective of planning and managing risk you most likely won’t succeed), the limited resources aspect that societies face, and tools to shield against risk, such as knowledge (research), protection and insurance. If I had to change on thing to better represent the risk management choices would be changing the assumption of only one risk. There are currently a multitude of risks present and some of equally high need of attention, given limited resources, sometimes they compete and you have to prioritize. Adding to this you have distributional effects, the area and population are wide and disperse, it is hard to protect all at once you have to start on some communities and build on. These are the aspects that I would try to also incorporate in the game."

For example, knowledge is demonstrated by identifying which comets are likely to hit. You can safely ignore those that are not going to and you need to focus on those that are. Knowledge allows you to understand the level of protection required to adequately meet the shock. In this game this was the level of the village raised as protection. It is a waste of resources and time to raise protection so high that the community cannot develop. Protection of a few does not help you progress. Finally insurance provided you a means of quickly recovering from a shock. The game highlighted that insurance is not necessarily immediately however it is required once you have reached a certain level of development. "

Knowledge, protection, and insurance\nwere all mandatory techniques for me.  I remembered\nthat all opportunity must be considered as well as all risk, so I immediately\nstarted building communities in order to advance my income level.  Once new communities were built, and my income\nlevel was sufficient, I upgraded them immediately, as I knew that upgrades\nwould increase my rate of return on development.  Despite the fact that I started with the goal\nof rapid development as my upmost priority, I was well aware of the potential loss\nI could incur from a comet impact.  I\ntempered the rate at which I built new communities in the first two levels and\nspread out my income spending by purchasing the highest level of insurance and\nraising my communities to prevent damage from comet impact.  When my income was depleted from the\nspending, I thought that I would be best time to focus on researching incoming\ncomets as that required no additional income.  \nI primarily alternated between researching comets and raising the communities.\nWhere the comets had a low probability of impact when they were halfway across\nthe sky, I ceased research activity.  If\nthere was more than one comet I focused on the first comet until I reached at\nleast 3 indication bars and then focused on the additional comets.  When a comet was more than 3/4ths of\nthe way across the sky and destined for impact, I made sure I had at least 4\nbars of research towards it. Despite attention given to protection and\nknowledge, I did not keep rapid development out of mind for I built new\ncommunities and made upgrades as my income level surpassed a certain\nthreshold.   My tactics proved to be consistently\nsuccessful which the key indicator that my risk management mechanism was quite\neffective."

The knowledge is not necessarily represented well in this game, given that the knowledge is always 1 or 0. I have to choose between protection and insurance because clearly having both protection and insurance will impede development severely. More specifically, insurance has a large upfront cost and gets more and more expensive with either increased game level or more upgraded pods (I cannot say for sure which is the cause). The insurance cost won't be too much of a problem for lower levels because the development is relatively easy speed up. However, for higher levels, the large upfront cost for insurance takes too much resources and impedes development significantly, especially higher level pods take longer to develop and therefore the cost in time is more pronounced. Additionally, although insurance covers a percentage of damage, it still needs time for repair and in the meantime, the development is slowed down.  Protection (leveling up the base) does not have upfront cost and can be adjusted to cope with the potential damage from the meteor. Although the aggregate cost for protection is higher that insurance, the protection can be used multiple times before it decreases significantly. Moreover, protection does not incur the damage repair process and won't affect the established development."

During the course of the game my first duty was to be sure that I had the necessary information about the comets. In some of the games I was very fortunate to have the comets miss the pods and the island. Most of the comets did land in the ocean without striking the island or the pods. With the information I obtained my main goal was to keep the flooding to a minimum by raising the island even though it was costly.The cost of raising the island was of little concern for me because the benefit outweighed the cost by keeping the flooding to a minimum and keeping the pods secure and keeping the residents of the island safe.So , The Power of Research in my opinion was of utmost importance in my decision making process."

All depended on the timing and on the balance that we maintain in our development and protection. For preparing for risk, at times we had to let go of opportunities like hard core development. If we invested in insurance, we had to wait till we get enough to invest on further development. But investment in insurance was long-term thinking for risk management.

That is great in real life but when you track all of the comets and still don't get enough juice in the bottle by the game's end, it's extremely disappointing. That's despite having elevated your village to the 8th level above the ground and having maximum protection. There is the only trade-off in the game - you have to watch comets and while you are doing it you can't raise the level of the village higher. That's not what it is in real life. You can do both at the same time while here the interface of the game doesn't allow you that. I have plenty of money for insurance, but I don't have time for protection. When I increase protection I don't see whether it had any positive influence on the response and remedial work after the comet impact. So I can't really say how preparation affected development.

The player should make calculated moves in terms of building new pod and/\nor developing the existing ones. Keeping the wealth for emergency spending,\ni.e. repairing comes at the price of missing your developmental goal. Also,\neven though spending time on watching the celestial bodies is essential for the\nrecovery, it keeps you away from developing the village. This is also true\nabout raising the land level. The cost for the research and raising the land\nlevel were negligible and both activities seemed to be very helpful.

In one incident,\ndespite the fact that the bar was above the level goal, a late hit, brought the\ndevelopment level below the level goal and caused failure, Thus, a deadly hit\ntowards the end of stage can be too costly.

In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe game required the player to identify risk and evaluate them in order to protect their environment. The risks were the result of the comet hitting the land/water and causing waves which produced flooding. I worked through the tutorial a few times before\nstarting the game, fearing that the game would be played out much faster than in the tutorial, but this was not the case. The key trade-offs were between money and security. When I initially played the game, I either did not focus on insurance or undervalued\nthe cost of insurance relative the potential damage caused by the comets hitting the land. After a few iterations, it was clear that it was considerably more beneficial to buy a large amount of insurance and interesting, the game seemed to be played faster\nat that point. Also using the lever to raise the island – another means of disaster mitigation was very effective and even though there was a cost associated with this intervention, I seemed to recover wealth very quickly. The least effective decision\nwas simply to build pods and to ignore the comets. \n\nIf you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game? \n\nAs stated above, after playing the game a couple of times, I realised just how important insurance was to protect the pods and recover from the damage caused by the comets. I initially underestimated the risk the comets posed and was surprised about how damage might vary – in some cases it was over 70 per cent, then it fell to some 25 per cent and in some cases the damage was zero; again depending on the level of insurance purchased and the degree to which I have elevated the island. \n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live? If I were to play the game again, I might suggest introducing some other threats so the players need to choose between more types of intervention. In this instance, the trade off was calculated in terms of financial cost. There was no attempt to introduce other costs e.g. if one had to choose between paying for education, health care etc. or disaster insurance. I live in a developed country (UK) where there is considerable risk of flooding and in fact there was extensive flood damage earlier this year. The Thames Barrier is one example of a costly but effective intervention."

For me the reason why it may make sense to force people to obtain at least minimal insurance policy would be the fact that people might choose not to obtain insurance because they are unwilling to spend some extra money before a disaster, but will most likely reach out to the government and seek its assistance one the disaster happens.

The role of risk management in the game was simply overwhelming as there as a lot of things that one has to care about for improving the city of Aloha. The  comets are a real piece of concern as there is another constraint in the form of timing for each level. So one has to properly  gain knowledge on construction of the Pods and upgrading them. The insurance also is a major concern since if we plan perfectly in developing the city with necessary research and upgrades there is no need for insurance. On the other hand insurance in worst case can help. In the case where one have to tilt the land in order to save the city from comet, the money kept on decreasing which hindered the development. Initially in the first and the second level i only opted for level 1 insurance since the impact of comet was limited and can be controlled with proper research. But when i moved on to the 3 level and so on , due to the time constraint i cannot do much research and so opted for level 3 insurance which covers 75 % of damage. This was the main step i took for protection."

Therefore, to have it more accurate and specific, a string of multiple indicators on the outputs that shall contribute to the supplementary activities of protection and coping, to be strengthened as one builds on the pods to each level.\nHowever, the ultimate mechanism that would have guided this in an apt manner would be the one of CPM assessment for Risk Management, which would be the factorial of all elements in consideration within the “Business Strategy” game. \nFurther, civilian mechanims suggestions, are more a sort of reflief mechanisms rather than an evadence sort of factor.",

My first thought as that I'm going to beat it in the first try without any troubles. Oh, how wrong was I. When I couldn't pass the third stage because the green bar on the left didn't match the expected level int the allowed time, I was confused. Why did it happen? I was sure that I didn't make any mistakes. All was going so right, all the free places on the ma were covered with my pods, that I upgraded all the time. Also, on every level i bought the 75% assurance and it was clear for me, that my little planet is safe and I'm going to have a lot of money in the future, because i wasn't supposed to lose a lot of money by repairing the pods at full cost. Still, i lost. On the second try, I realized that I spent to much time on building protection, because by the time I spent my time on lifting may pods above the water level, the bar on the left became red and my virtual country was not evolving. I understood, that the same happens in every economy. If we spend to much time and money on thoughtless and exagerated risk management, our economy and society evolve at a very small rate, or maybe remain at the same place. So, the more i prepaired for risk, the less i developed my virtual country. I decided to modifiy my strategy, and it worked. First of all, i didn't spend precious time and money on builidng an escessive protection when the time for a strong one still didn't come. I directed the biggest part of mye efforts to the development of my pods, and bought the assurance only when it was necessary. The second important thing i deduced was, that there is no nedd to build a protection of a very high level, even on the 4th and 5th stage. Instead, I tried to research the comets that represented the biggest level of risk, so, when it felt in the water, i would be prepared to build as much community connections as possible. Doing this, my protection level prevaled the severity of the comets, and after that i just put a few efforts to increase my protection by one ore two levels, because it decreases automatically after the comet hits. Still, my strategy didn't allow me to pass the 5th level, because I lacked two or three seconds to rich the milestone. So, the thing I learned from the game are the next ones:"

I build 2-3 pod at the first\ntime, since I can not spend all my money.  And then I should do the\nprotection and keep an eye on the upcoming comets. I should get knowledge from\nwatching the comets. If it is not too severe, like 1-2, Just keep watching to\nget knowledge. If it is immense severe, I will buy the insurance to do the\nprotection. I should put more time on watching the comets, since it will bring\nme more time to connect pods if the comet destroy the city.  At the meantime,\nI should continually build the pods. I do not need save much money on my\naccount, and it is better to use the money to develop. Above level 3, If I put\nmore attention on protection, it will affect the development. Sometimes, I can\nnot finish development within the time the game gives us.  If I play the\ngame more than once, I will change the time and sequence among protection, knowledge,\ninsurance and development. I will do as follows: development, protection,\nknowledge and insurance. I do not put much money on insurance unless the severe\nof comet is very high. I can put my money on development if the severe of comet\nis low. With the level I won, I can add more pods to build.  If I task\nwith developing a new version for the game, I think I should label the level\nclearly. Sometime I even do not know which level I am playing. I will reduce\nthe time of connection of pods. It takes too long to connect and sometimes it\nneeds 60 time connection. It is a bit boring. I will give more tips on every\nlevel and teach the player how to success. The last but not the least, if you\nsuccessful play the level 3, if you lose level 4, does not play it again from\nlevel 1. It wastes time. I think the purpose of the game is to teach us how to\nmanage the risk, so it is important about the game design. The game is to teach\nus how to manage, but not just a game."

Protection is how\nyou can protect against comets .Risk management entails that if your protection\n matches the severity of a comet that\nhits, you will be fully protected. The more time i spent with the comet selected,\nthe more research I had will collect, but this took away time i could spend\ndoing other actions, hence, it was all about balancing. The more research i had\ndone, the more time I had to make community connections before a shock hits. This\nis another way I had to prepare for incoming shocks if the protection had  begun to cost too much money. When I purchased\nan insurance plan, I knew was covered for the rest for the round against\nresiduals that would befall me after taking \nprotection. Damaged growers were also be cheaper depending on the\nplan  bought. Preparation played a\npivotal role in ensuring that resources were allocated efficiently to different\ncompeting uses.

But then I purchased just three pods and then went for development in stages while protecting them through raising levels and  at least 50% insurance levels. When I had some surplus source for purchasing new undeveloped pods, i went for that. This way helped me to win Level 2 of the game.

It taught the variety of obstacles which one face in the name of development such as any natural disaster or any man made activity triggering the birth of long term disaster. During the course of the game there were number of choices which had be made such as between the number of blocks to be constructed and along with it doing research work on the extent of damage of disaster as well as the probability of it to happen. Apart from this choice was also made regarding investing some of the monetary resources in getting insurance of the development to reduce the post disaster effects. At times trade offs were to be made between these three as all these three components were important in reducing the effect of disaster. Development was greatly affected when the knowledge about the risk was less as according to the knowledge gained the efforts or the means used to delay or overcome the risk changed. Most importantly the time period was increased and decreased as per the knowledge of the risk. Insurance on the other hand also helped in recovering early from the losses faced due to risk. "

On the other hand, if the comet was unlikely to hit, and / or if the severity was announced to be rather low, I decided it was not worth investing in research for something that was not going to take place, or would not cause a lot of damage and therefore had a rather low risk for my community.

The different\ninsurance policies giving different amount of risk covers, allowing variety of\nchoices to choose from is appealing. It helps in building risk strategies and\nmanagement skills.

Therefore development was increasing faster in\ncomparison to the one without risk management. I played this game a couple of\ntimes which introduced me to a plethora of risk preparation and adversity\nbattling techniques.  In my first\nattempt, I was unsuccessful as I concentrated upon building and developing pods\nrather than buying insurances and researching about the comets. In my very next\nattempt I cleared the first level with all the pods developing at enormous\nrates.

The key is a correct combination of the three approaches, which are more profitable in different times of the game: a good insurance from the initial phases of the level is crucial to incentivate development and observe the possible comets with less concern. Knowlegde when an extremely desructive comet is approaching the planet, is important to increase your post-collision reaction capacities. Protection, in the game, is less easy to define, but it permits the player not to be threatened by minor comets, increasing the time in which he can take care of the village development."

If you invest in protection, then it's like preventing the fire before the fire occurs and causes a lot of damage.  Insurance while helpful, works by essentially pooling in money from the community during good times, in order to rebuild after damage has occurred.   So you can think of insurance as a buffer, that helps smooth out shocks, whether they are positive or negative.   \n\nI think the readings basically have told us that there's much more benefit in protection than there is in insurance, simply because the cost efficient of protection is much much more, while insurance is guaranteed to be probably 1:1.  By 1:1 I mean for each dollar of damage that occurs, 1 dollar of insurance is used to pay for that damage, while protection often times the ratio is 1:3, where for every dollar spent, it saves 3 dollars of damage.  \n\nJust my two cents.

When you are trying to get first is building your main source of income, then build the protections needed, next use insurance to cover losses, and the last is increase your income here. In the game, protections become urgent when the meteors in a higher level hits your buildings and you will need insurance to at least reduce your losses. If you don't do that, your losses will be very hard to recovered back from its former state. At the first time, I was focused on building one pods, then do not use protection, because I was thinking that the protection wastes money, and I was using insurance alone. I suffered a lot and cannot reach at least level 5. My income was very slow because of meteors' attack into my building. The second time I played, I was diverging more pods, but still focus first on one to ensure my income is strong, then I buy protection and insurance as the game plays, I was failed in the level 5 because I don't have enough time to repair all the losses that I were suffered from meteor attacks. The key here is to protect your income from losses that could occur in the real life and don't hesitate to buy it as early as possible because you can't predict risk at all. I learn that protections are very important because it could help me (and my family) from suffering too much losses. Insurance helps me to cover losses faster, and I was able to create faster income when the losses are covered. You should not despise protection and insurance that are covered in the real life, they are important for covering most of your risks."

In terms of knowledge, I made sure I understood shocks that may happen or hit an area, prognosticate different types of shocks, following very closely their vicious trajectories, their impact, and possible after effects which may force people to live under harsh conditions for a very long period of time.\n\nIn terms of protection, I had to envision the immediacy of negative impact on the environment, how to reduce the probability and size of losses, and increase the benefits to be derived from the efforts, risk management initiatives taken to ensure viability of decision-making plans, and sustainability. Prepare those who are vulnerable to build resilience in the face of tragedies. \n\nIn terms of insurance, I took great care to consider the transfer of resources across the people within the concerned community, from good to bad status of  the country; cultivating a proactive attitude, taking positive, energetic actions to prevent occurrences, and/or reducing devastating impact on development was my aim objective while playing the game, because I strongly believe that whether risks are systemic (natural disasters, earthquakes, flood/Tsunami), imposed, or idiosyncratic, development can occur only by successfully confronting risks and pursuing available opportunities, making efforts, such as updating technology, making up to date equipment more accessible, in addition to helping the people recover from losses and derive the most benefits. But in the context of the game, pods damaged from flooding can be rebuilt quicker and at a less expensive price; insurance also covers lost development time after the pods are repaired.\n\nActually, I played the game twice, but not completely the second time; so, if I had played it fully the second time around, I would have moved in a more swiftly manner, clicking on the comets that were advancing one following the other before they reached their targets; moving in a swift manner, being vigilant, well prepared, and being proactive, while using the three powers ( Research, Protection, and Insurance) in concert with development to help create a healthy community, in addition to finding the perfect balance, are the main things I learned from the game. In fact, balance risk preparation is very important, seeing that the community falls victim to these falling comets, and we know that the shocks resulted from these comets creep into the water and cause waves that hinder development within Alora.\n\nFrom a risk management perspective, I would recommend the use of larger images with more specific captions for a new version of the game; and this would fit perfectly well, or best represent the risk management choices that matter most in the community where I actually live.\n\n"

These choices force trade-offs between development, conservation of resources for insurance and rebuilding while providing protection and information gathering.  Preparation played a major role in managing risk and opportunity as purchasing insurance and mitigating comet risk were critical to moving forward in development and higher levels of achievement.  The roles of risk management were present in all aspects of the game and a key requirement of a player's success in managing development.  The game also showed that it is helpful to learn from experience to effectively mitigate risk while engaging opportunities.  \n\n\nAfter playing the game a couple times, it became apparent that while developing pods, it was critical to address incoming comets as these produce damage that consumes resources and time to recover.  It is especially necessary to allocate time to protecting against comet strikes while finding suiting timing to continue development of the community.  I learned that the elements of risk and opportunity needed to be balanced to ensure successful, sustainable development.  In particular, it was far more beneficial to address comet strikes as they occurred rather than attempt to rebuild and repair after strikes.  The time and cost needed to recover far exceeded the costs to prepare and address comets and flooding as they occurred.  Preparation was key to successfully navigating the development in the risk environment.  \n\n\nIf I were to propose any changes to the game in a new version, I think it would make sense to assign varying levels of risk to different development locations.  For example, properties located closer to the water would require increased risk tolerance, insurance and recovery costs.  Further, I would recommend differing insurance rates for different properties.  These suggestions would likely complicate the game's clear message of risk management but would perhaps mirror risk management in a manner more aligned with actual practice.  Overall, I think the game is a good representation of risk management and the functions of research, protection and insurance as they relate to development.  The concept works well as an interactive exercise to demonstrate these principles and their context in a simulated environment."

Each has costs, in terms of time or currency or both, which must be traded against costs of developing the communities and against each other. Too much preparation caused developmental stagnation (time ran out before you reached the developmental goal), and too little caused damage from disaster that halted development entirely. The trade-off metaphor in the game is really quite marvelous. The time limit and developmental goal for each level represents the impetus that individuals, companies, and governments have to put as many resources as possible into development, while the risk of bankruptcy, failure, or negative events outside your control is represented by meteors that have only a possibility, not a certainty, of causing damage. Thus, a balance must be struck between concrete returns (development) and theoretical losses (theoretical because each meteor has less than 100% chance to hit)."

We also need to understand that knowing the key components of risk management is not enough to enhance development and coping with certain shocks. From the Horizon game, the key to a successful implementation of risk management comes only when there is a balance of the key components being used in managing such shocks before and after they hit. As a matter of facts,  the most important components of effective risk management includes; \n\nPreparing in Advance by Researching on comets, gaining Knowledge on the possibility of these comets hitting the ocean that causes floods, its Severity, obtaining Protection against this shock by raising our land to reduce the impact of the Comet on our pods, obtaining Insurance which makes it cheaper and faster to rebuild our damaged pods in order to find a balance between growing our community \nand at the same time, preparing for these potential shocks in the form of comets. During my game play, I made choices of researching Comets and knowing their severity which helped me on the insurance plan to obtain and the level of land raising protection I will need in case the comet hits. Also as a result of preparation I noticed a reduction in damages from 80% (my first game) to a subsequent 50% and 9% intermittently.\n\nIn continuation, if I played the game only once and when I am to play again, what I would do differently is to try as much as possible to raise my land in prevention of the potential shocks that posed a challenge for me during my first play. Playing the game more than once improved my understanding to an extent in which I realized we have to always consider all the components of risk management in order to find a balance between them to enhance development and the possibility of coping with shocks. I realized that whenever I focus too much on protection due to a potential shock by comets with high severity, it became difficult for me to win a particular level. Hence I always tried to minimize protection and focus on research, building pods and obtaining a high value insurance to help rebuild my community whenever i sensed a high severity comet.  This strategy worked for my progress.\n\nTo add, if given the task to develop another version of this game, I would increase the rebuilding speed of the pods which are virtually slow as compared to the speed of the Comets which approaches the earth faster than you could think. This puts the player in a state of jeopardy and one could end up making choices in a hurry which in reality we need to use the information from research to prepare and cope with shocks. Despite these, the game is very interesting and a great learning avenue. I would love to play it again and again.\n\nConclusively, I learned from the game that; whenever a shock is imminent it might be too late to protect or buy insurance but we can still make community connections in order to cope with damages or shocks or even prevent some of these shocks. In my community, we are challenged by the shock of Flood when it rains. To this effect, our community has been creating networks with nearby communities to jointly produce a solution to the problem. The major challenge has been; not enough resources and people loosing property for better drainage construction."

I tired many different methods but had trouble getting past the second level and only rarely, getting the bar high enough to reach level four. In this game, you have to manage risk while balancing it with development, much like in the real world. You can not spend all of your resources on protection or on research because then there will not be sufficient money, time, or other resources to build or upgrade the pods. In reality, you would be best off having ample insurance. During the game, I combined both high and low levels of insurance with more or less focus on other protective management tools in different game attempts. Ultimately, I discovered that the lower insurance policy was best because it is better to prevent, or developing ways to minimize effects of shocks, instead of having to deal with it afterwards. Concurrently, as the tutorial mentions, it is best to repair the pods immediately after the comets cause the damage. It is possible to succeed with the broader, more expensive insurance policy, but I did not find it effective because I would save more money by preparing for the damage."

It is like multitasking\namong the different projects so as not to allow the other project suffer at the\nexpense of the one being focused on. It is very important to develop a\ncommunity and then, strategize. There should be adequate research and\ndevelopment, it helps and when the shocks come, there should be adequate\ninsurance and upgrading as well as research.  To succeed, you have to assess the obstacles\nof risk management, once you have gathered some of these information, you are\nable to reduce most of the uncertainty about the risk. Risk  is composed by two elements, (probability) and\nimpact (consequences)and the coping of the after effects. The impact could be\nmaximized or minimized by the external environment, internal conditions and of\ncourse, the responsible and effective grade of risk management. So, when you reduce\nthe uncertainty of risk, identifying its causes, (drivers of shocks) and\nestimating a possible severity. After that you could treat the different causes\nof risk with high severity and then begin to outline the possible policies,\nprograms or activities to exonerate the risk. Sometimes you may design actions\nto lessen only the probability, other time you could only lessen the impact or\neven both of them. There is also the control design which is targeted at the\nresponse to each step in what is known as the \"risk chain\", There could\nbe control measures to alert us when risk occurs, we can have preventive measures\nto prepare us towards the phase. All these could be considered as a strategic\nplanning model which could be applied to life and business. It is paramount to\nmake the necessary research, understand the risk and shock involved and design\nthe possible ideal actions to cope with the after effects. The goal is to\neradicate or lessen the probability of risk and treat the causes of risk.  We can also talk about the protective measures\nto lessen the impact and corrective measures ideal to cope with the risk and\nafter effects."

I think this would have made the game more complicated as now you would have to think twice before applying for a loan for re-building pods as interest would be charged against it. A community where there are natural calamities and every now and then the community is in a fear of a falling comet and flooding, this is evident that money will be needed to repair them. Insurance is the best way to motivate and fund such communities having a constant fear of natural disasters to re-build the pods. People cannot be applying for loans every now and then the moment a calamity occurs. This would push them to deep financial crisis and development of the community will be majorly hampered.  \n\nInstead, he/she could have focused on proposing factors of \"incentives, behaviour and resources\" to be embedded in the game (factors affecting your decisions regarding risk management, with the factor of information already been covered in the game) when added to the game alters your risk management strategy of knowledge, protection and insurance.

At the starting of the first level itself, I bought the 75% insurance cover. As I built my pods, I kept an eye on the comets (research) and increased my protection to match the severity of the potential disaster. Also, the research helped give me more time to create community connections. Due to these reasons, none of my pods suffered any damage during all 4 levels of the game I played. The resources spent on preparation helped me to utilize all the remaining money for development without having to save money to spend on repairing. Although initially I invested in heavy insurance and protection, it eventually paid off and despite curbing my ability to grow in the immediate future, I was able to then develop better ahead."

Through trial-and-error, not any wisdom on my part, I ultimately chose to focus primarily on research and protection because, again, they helped prepare/prevent risk in the most resource ($) effective way. This was moderately successful, and I did purchase insurance and obviously repair any damaged structures. But in this particular game, I found that-for me-preventing and preparing through research was more effective than simply purchasing expensive insurance. However, in my case, I found it difficult to immediately expand development while preparing for risk at the same time (this is after I already built my pods and made my initial development). This was my primary problem."

The trade-off actually consisted in how to balance all of these factors in order to limit the damages and to have to spend less money to cope at the end, and in the meantime continue to develop (which is the optimal goal). So basically, the question was : should i spend more money in protection and insurance, and not develop enough my economy, or should i develop it as fast as possible but then face huge risks without protection. Then, the problem actually consists in how balancing protection and insurance, and in the meantime observe the meteors to obtain a more precise idea of the risk, but being unable to prepare for the possible crash."

Risk management in the game comes in the forms of researching on the meteors to gain time to mitigate the meteor strike (knowledge), investing resources over time to raise the surface level above flood-lines (protection) and purchasing insurance to unload some of the risks to insurers (insurance). From my experience playing the game, protection affects development the most over long periods of the game because if the surface level is above the flood-lines, there will be no averse effect on development. Nevertheless, protection is both time costly and expensive and investments have to be purchased in the event of a high-probability high-severity meteor. However, it is important to note that even low-probability meteors have a chance of hitting and such incidents may derail your plans to complete the level in time. Such trade-offs between the different forms of risk management have to be juggled cautiously in order to beat the later levels of the game."

Research allowed me to dodge the impact of most meteors, meaning that I could pass level one without too much difficulty. However, the lack of protection and insurance meant that if a serious shock hit, it would spell the end of the game for me. In other rounds of the game, I instead concentrated on building a few buildings to their max. This made it easier to rebuild after a shock, and allowed me to spend a bit more on protection. I conclude that even if the shocks can be foreseen, it is impossible to brace against them on short notice if no prior measures had been implemented.\nA community should therefore invest in efficient, durable upgrades first, with emphasis on investments that provide the most value for money, based on expected return. For example, insurance in the game was often not required for the first few levels, as protection provided enough resilience to withstand the shocks. Since protection did not expire at the end of a level, it proved a better investment, as it could help withstand more shocks later.\nHaving a small amount of very developed infrastructure also made it much easier to repair after a shock had hit. This could also be true in real life, where more developed and resistant structure would result in less maintenance cost, operational costs, and repair costs after shock damage.\nThere is also something to be said about the last minute benefits that can be gained when facing risk. Research in the game allowed more time to create links, which in turn resulted in better protection. Even if this protection was ephemeral, it is sometimes the difference between success and defeat. The real life parallel is that a community should always be ready to react and enact last-minute policies and preparations when a shock is imminent.\nThe game presents many aspects of risk, and still more parallels could be drawn from it. Real life is of course much more complicated, due to the many different sources of shocks that can compound and come up at any time, but the same principles apply. Between knowledge, preparation, protection, and insurance, the negative effects of shocks can be greatly minimized, and opportunities can be captured with much more efficiency, resulting in a better quality of life for everyone involved."

Sometimes by combining the knowledge and protection, insurance was not necessary. other times i had to take insurance even if knowledge and protection were high especially when the time between comet's falling is short.Risk preparedness can slow development, since all resources are directed towards the preparation. But once it's done, developing can continu. If i play it again, I'll learn from mistakes especially on the part of research and i will invest in it. And if I have to replay it several times after the first time i will try to accelerate development and build and develope more pods."

First of all, you have to build the pods and then manage them. you have to manage the risks by observing the comets, for example how fast is the comet, what is the severity, and how much research is needed. The way i tackled it was based on the severity of the comet. If it was very severe i spend my every dollar on insurance, i researched it thoroughly and kept the meter on the right on its pace. The more time i spent observing it, the more time i got in the end to recover it which reduced my damages very much and in some cases very severe comets did not affected my pods. The trade-offs were obviously money, to upgrade my pods or buy insurance. In some cases, the speed of comets was fast and i did not have much time to gain knowledge about it. preparation for risk helped very much. If you have enough resources and you are efficient in managing those resources the effects of these comets can be minimized. The main thing which i learned from the game was how to manage the resources that i have. Initially i was not spending some time on research and my recovery time was only few seconds. Then i spent time according to the severity of the comet and same is the case with the insurance. I bought expensive insurance which covered more for severe comets and vice-versa. I also learned that we can upgrade the pods the second time i played. It helped a lot in recovering fast. A person may not see a comet hitting earth in one's life, but if it would be an earthquake or a flood it would be more realistic. The pods can be changed to a house, or something valuable for us. My point here is that a person should feel the \"what if\" scenario here. What if he was there in a situation when you know a tornado is coming to your town. From my point of view it would be more realistic.   "

The role a Risk management is to balance all of the choices as best you can to maximize coverage and limit the damage at the same time, while rebuilding your encampment or whatever it is you are protecting quickly as to limit costs, downtime, labor, liability, and the total human impact. I played the game 3-5 times, and I did not make it past the first round, due to limited time for the day. My first game I did quite badly, and did not get more than two pods build and just assessed the game. Once I had learned thru that first initial play I thought for a minute and planned.  I did learn quickly you must make quick decisions on the comets based on a quick assessment, research them better to limit the damage they cause, and prepare for the impact. Fast planning was another key, I did develop a quick plan based on the game itself and every play after that I gained knowledge. After the first round of play I grouped the and built the pods quickly and tightly, bought insurance, scanned the sky, made assumptions, and made protection in between as fast as possible. I did upgrades in the later rounds to the pods as it helped me improve my encampment faster thru increased revenue. Movement helped, If I did one thing to long I paid for it, if I watched the sky, I did not protect as well, if I built to much I could not track the sky. If I could add to the game or develop a part of it I would add more of the ability to multi task. You can watch some things and slightly monitor others at the same time, while every thing else is going on. We all do that in life, it is part of it, the problem is we only get one life, we must maximize the knowledge earlier to get the benefit in the end and along the way. To much fun, not paying attention up front, means years of work later for most of us. The game and theory can be applied in almost any model for a newer version to the game, where I am at instead of comets and waves it would be rock slides, floods, falling trees, just to name a few. This really add's to the fun on your way into work in the dark."

We can make a priority that can be done when idle to face disruption or disaster. Of the three elements that can be used, namely knowledge, protection, and insurance I could make a priority to minimize the negative impact of the disaster. The first time I did was make a purchase insurance. Why purchase insurance? It is very clear that when the disaster came, to fix everything needed funds. If there are things that can be covered by insurance, it would be useful to reduce the cost at the time of repair. Then protection. It is also important to be able to minimize that when a disaster or disruption coming, the negative effects can be minimized. Even its exposure to the public that there are, in this form of protection is to reduce the negative effects that appear not to eliminate the negative impact. And the protection afforded should be is the best protection, so that people there can be a safe, quiet and alert when the catastrophe came. "

Serious  research should be geared toward discovering, understanding more comets and comets related activities, the more time you prepare for it, the less damages you will however record, because people knowledge is raised, best practices is shared, basic escape guideline, rules and regulation and do's and don't impacted on the people and that makes them less vulnerable because their awareness is raised.\nIn addition to huge investment of viable city infrastructure provided, understanding historical, topography, sea level and it behavior especially now with climate change, the sea level rise, construction should take note of all the externalities in other to reduce the impact of whatever risk that might come.\nPreparation for risk management affect development in just few ways, it however slow the phase of development putting risk management atop means doing the right things to safeguard the future therefore risk management preparation affect development immediate and after sometime. Now this can be done by building foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficult to design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will react and how the context will change.\nSo we really need to implement basic policies that focus on what's most important, like setting the right incentives for people to manage the risk well or making the information available, and to make sure the policies are revised over time regularly to correct, over time, when more information is available or when we observe that some policies might have some negative side consequences.\nTo me the game should be simplified, with a real life scenerios or the game should be community based prototype approach, where all the features of a semi-urban community should be captured clearly, and I also recommend that when that is done it will go a long away in spreading the knowledge and create or raise awareness, prepare people mind on the impending risk we faced as individual, community, state, nations and as a globe which could either be financial risk, natural disaster, climate change or health related risk e.g the sub-Saharan AFrica is faced with an epidemic of EBOLA disease outbreak a very deadly disease ravaging the whole region, now since the spread is moving fast, the  second principle is to build foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficult to design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will react and how the context will change. But educating the people on what to do at this material time is important in other to reduce the collateral damage it might result to.\nIf allowed to change some things in the game, surely it would be focused on a real life situation, where it can simplicity, acceptance, reference point for teachers and student of risk management, children would be catched young with a simplify game as they play it does not only prepare their mind on evacuation guideline only but equally prepare their mind on real time risk we faced in the society.\nFinally, the game for me has enlightened, educate and raised my awareness on the various dangers we're faced daily, it also made me to be an observer of my environment around me."

It was necessary to assess the likelihood of the risk, and still prepare for it, whether or not the probability was high or it was predicted to be less severe. The financial principle was also very important, as some of my decisions were based on the resources that I had available.Sometimes, I made sure that I had insurance which would cover damages, and when I could not afford the highest coverage, I would raise my floor, as this was sometimes more affordable than the 75% insurance coverage. I would sometimes wait until my wealth increased before taking additional insurance. I paced a lot of focus on research on each comet. However despite my research results of the severity and chances, I never dismissed any risk, despite how unlikely it seemed. I focused more on repairing and insuring what I had already built, than creating new developments. "

In the first 3 levels I decided not to buy expensive insurance and put most of the money in building, but afterwards I was forced to change that strategy. The most cost effective preparation was protection construction.\nAfter the first time I discovered two things: first is that one could upgrade pods more than once, second is that it is not always neccessary to buy insurance, because most of the comets miss the target. The maain thing I\\ve learned is that one should think before managing the risk, that is to assess what measures are most cost effective.\nI would propose addding some feature that counts money earned.

I made made a number of choices and some of them include creating a healthy environment by accumulating the pods (development), which shows on the balance scale (left lower side of the screen) and preparing for the threats/attacks which are represented by the comets in the game. In terms of knowledge, protection and insurance, certain trade-offs were made. For example, while I was creating a healthy environment, I had to trade-off certain amount of dollars (resources) in other to ensure that the impact of the threats/damages is reduced to the affordable minimum through insurance. At other times, I ensured that knowledge was sought through research so that the impact of the potential threats (comets) was known before they actually took place. In this way, certain measures are put in place to ensure adequate protection. Preparation for risk affected development immediately it was done. This is because while preparing for risk, there is a little delay in the time that was meant for development to take place through the upgrade of the pods. Moreover, the resources that were used in preparing for risk also had some effects on the general development because they could be otherwise used for development. However, in the long run, they rate of recovery i.e. coping that was experienced made the impact of the threats/hits lesser and therefore allowed for quick recovery."

The object of\nthe game was that you had to build your buildings and watch out for\ncomets which could potentially damage your buildings. In order to\nprepare for risks you had to protect your buildings by raising your\ncity up and buying insurance in case damaged was taken. Because I\nonly had so much money, both times I played I sacrificed building so\nthat I could protect the couple of buildings I did have. You could\nresearch each comet to evaluate the threat, which helped some. But no\nsooner was I past a minor threat, when a bigger threat showed up. An\nactual hit put me back financially and slowed me down from being able\nto build more. The first time I played I felt that insurance that\noffered 50% coverage would suffice, but when more dangerous comets\nappeared I found I needed more insurance. I had four or five\nbuildings that time, but I lost really quickly. Only three of my\nbuildings were upgraded. The second time I played, I purchased the\n75% coverage right off the bat, but that then decreased my money\nright in the beginning. I could only build three buildings, and I\nthink I might have upgraded one. All this is done against a timer,\nwhich I pretty much negated, since I couldn't really survive the\ncomets, anyway. There's a specific balance needed in order to build\nyour city, as well as protect it, and then insure it on top of that.\nI think I could achieve that, but it will take another couple of\ntries. I think one change that could be made that would help the game\nbetter represent real life would be to take into account the\nindividual buildings. Currently in the game, if there was damage from\na comet, I could quickly just repair it before the next comet (I\ntried to always save money for repairs, if nothing else). With\nindividuals to take into account, there's then the possibility that\nthe people in one building wouldn't be able to make the necessary\nrepairs before the next comet. If previous comet damage, or any other\nunrelated expensive decision, left the family too broke that they\ncouldn't make the repairs in time, I could end up just losing my\nbuildings. In other words, make it so that I send the money for\nrepairs to the building, instead of just directly making repairs.\nThen, put in a time limit for how long it takes for a building to\nrepair. Some buildings will get repaired, but one or two will take\nlonger, and so you have to work harder to protect the town. This\nwould be an annoying change, however. Although I support people\nhaving their freedoms to make their own decisions, it would be really\nfrustrating if you had to sit their and watch people not be prepared\nfor a potential disaster, especially when you are trying everything\nyou can to protect them."

At first I started by spending too much time protecting the village through raising it up which did not give me time to research or have money to build and develop. Then I tried concentrating on developing first and researching which still did not give me the chance to protect and prevent damages. Having too many comets attacking as well did not give me enough time to protect my village. Through my trials of the game, I learnt that even by gaining knowledge I still could not prevent the hitting of the comets , but I can lessen the damage or prevent it by buying the highest insurance rate. So, the first thing I did in the other trials was starting with the insurance package to be on the safe side. By this , coping with the shock was easier and less damage happened and sometimes none. At times, I had to make trade-offs by sometimes choosing not to spend too much time on protecting and rather spend it on researching. This helped me with money that gave me chance to build and develop more,but did not give me too much time as comets were increasing on numbers. At my last successful trial I understood better how to balance between my choices. So, I started by the insurance,then building two pods and increasing two levels of the island, then immediately researching to help lessen the damage which actually helped. Then again in building other new ones and continuing with other one level of raising and my researching after that. So, by balancing between each component I managed to succeed and reach level 5. I was very happy with the different choices I made and how better to balance through my choices for improvements."

The aim of the game, which is to maximize development by minimizing damages due to potential risks, is very much in line with the goal of risk management.The latter as we all know is all about increasing the benefits and decreasing the losses that people experience when they face risk.\n\nOnce a risk or a comet was seen on the horizon, the first thing that was done, was gaining information about the potential of the risk. Next came the choice or rather the trade off between protection and insurance. Both were a must and were resorted to, much before a risk appeared, but the proportion in which each is to be used, greatly varied depending upon the severity of the risk.  Effective research and preparation for risks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment for future safety. Insurance not only means protection but also facilitates the necessary repair work, whenever there are damages. Apart from all this, effective coping mechanism (promptly joining all the golden ovals to each other once a comet was hit) greatly mitigated the possibility of any damage.It is important to bear in mind at all times that development is the prime concern.Developmental activities must go on at all times. \n\nRepeated iterations on the game would make one more adept at striking the right balance between protection and risk. It will make one more prompt in development activities as they are the source of fund and eventually time translates into money, so the faster the development happens, the more money one gets. It will also make one more fluent with the coping mechanism. It is also important to understand here that as one reaches higher levels in the game or as society reaches a certain level of development, it needs more fund than before to protect itself from potential risks and to grow further at the same time. Therefore at those levels, the magnitude of risk management should also increase accordingly.\n\n Even though the game models risk management very well, a further scope for improvement cannot be ruled out. There could be more variety of risks in the game. Apart from comets and rising water levels, there could be earthquakes and so on. Opportunities could also be dealt with similarly. There can be a sample matrix correlating the risk with a given severity, the damage protection levels, and the level of insurance required. This will reduce the random noise factor in the game (specially in making a choice between protection and insurance) and will make the decision making more effective.\n"

In real life is usually dificult to grasp the importance of insurance since it is hard to see the cost/benefit ratio, given the fact that benefits might be perceived very far away in the future.

It was also evident that inadequate preparation to the risks faced were detrimental and counter-productive to the future development prospects of the city; if a city is to develop, there must be extensive risk mitigation and preparation strategies and mechanisms in place."

Another limited resource available was money, which could be directed towards either insurance, investing in the community to allow faster development or in increasing our protection to be more resilient to asteroid impacts. In order to meet the development needs of the stage, you were forced to either develop new plots of land or to upgrade previously developed plots to allow for an increase in production to the level necessary for the stage. Often I found I did not take enough risk and was not able to meet the output level for the stage, so net time I played I would increase my risk appetite during each successive play of the game.

Firstly, you had to develop your community to the best of your abilities which is a necessary concept in risk management as you have to properly build the foundation. This is same as the positive risk we take in sending our lovely kids to great schools and providing them with sound education. After this, a person playing the game has to ensure that he or she optimizes the level to which they want to develop their community, will you be developing the entire community? or just as much as is necessary to realize optimal gains?. This is a very important risk management concept that the game teaches because of the cost limitations suffered by individuals, households and small communities. The game teaches us that we can't buy 100% insurance or the highest level of protection all the time especially when you are just starting out but you can build on what you have in a step-wise manner this could be achieved by collaboration between individuals, communities, government intervention etc. Another important risk management concept the game teaches is the ability to recognize risk and also evaluate it to determine your risk response and requisite preparedness. In the game, the risks level was depicted by the comets severity, its chance of occurring and the protection level required to cope after it crashes. The player uses this info to ''ramp up'' and decide how much protection or insurance is required to save him and his household from the comet's negative effects."

The constant evaluation of the severity and likelihood of a given threat becoming realised, and preparing for it, is at the core of what risk management is about for me and I assume that is the point of the game.\n\nI played the game several times and experimented with a range of different emphasis in strategy. Common for all attempts was a constant re-investment in upgrades of the pods in order to increase the resources available for more upgrades of both pods and preparations. In terms of my protection strategies I tried emphasis on research in order to increase community connections; I emphasised insurance to see to what extent a sustain-and-rebuild strategy would fare (not very well); and finally I also emphasised protection to better sustain impacts.\n\nPlacing the emphasis on one element of the three was not a viable strategy. I found that an emphasis on knowledge would nevertheless mean I sustained heavy damage from major events also with good community connections. A focus on insurance meant insurmountable impact on the development scale and costly rebuilding. Finally, a focus on protection also reduced the development levels, even appearing (imagined or not) to slow the revenue stream down (I assume this is part of the cost referred to in the instructions).\n\nThe strategy I found took me the furthest (just short of completing level 6) was an emphasis on both knowledge and on protection. I would re-invest generated revenue in protection, especially after the level bar was full, and I constantly kept research bars high relative to the severity of the threat of any given comet. I only invested in insurance where I judged the severity and likelihood of a major event surpassing my protection were sufficiently high.\n\nIf I got to add one element it would be fluctuating insurance costs which I did not get the impression are in play. If, like me, the player chooses to take out the insurance only after finding that one of the comets is a high likelihood/high impact event, then the cost for the insurance would go up substantially. I have yet to encounter an insurer who would not raise premiums if an event had become more likely. Thus, insurance is something you take out before an event is imminent or suffer increased costs and this should be reflected also in the game."

The preparation did holt development as there were more funds allocated to research and preparation of risk. but in the long run it did pave ways for future prosperity for development. the trade offs that i made was always between investing in research or investing in insurance. \ni have played the game quite a few times. according to my understanding i would have definitely bought more insurance and spent more time on research if i had know that makes life easy along the way. i would also have gone through the tutorial a bit more to be absolutely sure about how i shall proceed in playing the game.The most important thing that i learn from this game is that you ought to be prepared before calamities come and you ought to have proper procedures set in order to handle tough situations.\nIf i were given a chance to edit this game slightly i would have looked at research option more carefully where one touch of button should in fact star the session and should continue until i want to stop. And also while the research was on its process i would like to keep other stuff going. \nThe place where i live should change the way to make sure that building codes are properly followed when they are being approved and prepared. Too many times i have seen that building permissions and plans do not match with the end result. There shall be more research done as to why the landlords don not spend more money to secure its premises so that it is not at risk. The authorities need to come up with laws and take that law into effect so that people who does not abide by it should be penalized or punished appropriately for that matter. If they do not send a strong signal i am afraid this is going to be dooms day for my city as i believe that 70% structures are prone to disaster when it comes to moderate to high level earthquake. they should also raise awareness so that people know what is expected of them when it comes to what to do after the earthquake.

If quality is\nstressed too much, it will cost more and time will not be favoring. The role of\nrisk management is therefore to skillfully find a balance between these\ncomponents so that the scarce resource is utilized to the optimum for the\ncompletion of the project in time. Too much engagement in protection may lead\nto depletion of resource without having time and resource left for research and\nconstruction. Whereas spending too much resource without giving due importance\nto protection and research leads to exposure to comets thereby destroying\nwhatever spent on the construction. Having insurance and research of adequate\nlevel was found to be helpful in protecting against destruction and in rebuilding\nthe damages.

For example the player learned that it is better to enforce at least some degree of protection before buying an insurance plan, as well as there is no need to buy insurance plans twice (better save up a bit and go for the one you originally wanted one straight away). Although the game was played only once, important conclusions were made on the completion of each level and alterations in strategy were made for future levels accordingly. This pretty much demonstrates how risk management works in real life, when people learn from previous experiences and hopefully avoid doing the same mistakes in future leading to more robust risk management systems. I also liked the game improvement idea a lot. I think that introducing specific means of protection, rather than just protection in general would make the game more realistic and challenging. It could be incorporated in a way similar to insurance. In the game’s insurance tab different policies offer different coverage and are therefore priced accordingly, same could be done for protection. Various means of protection (e.g. warning system, construction of waves barriers etc.) could be priced differently and increase the overall protection level to a different degree.\n\nAs for the negatives, I think that the reflection is a bit too descriptive and lacks in depth evaluation and analyses of risk management components and tradeoffs between those and development. It doesn’t have a clear explanation on how does the risk management preparation affect development and on what time scale do the costs and benefits arise. The explanation is not very clear and some bits are rather difficult to understand.\n",

This game must meet external time-constraints which only having a few minutes to reach decision. In practice, the quality of the move decision usually improves the further the games look ahead. How safe is the move? The goal is to minimize the risk from a threat and at the same time is to maximize the gains from putting a pod. For me, as fast as possible, I put a pod before the threat comes. Once the threat comes, I click the threat and hopefully I do not get hit by the threat. I immediately react once the threat come. In addition, protection is added in full to minimize the damage that is caused by the threat. \nIf I were given a chance to play again, I consider to upgrade the pod as soon as possible instead of build several pod. Thinking too much about the protection of the threat might not a best idea to maximize the gain. If we have a chance, then we should go further to build and upgrade the pod and of course, we need to pay for the insurance to cover it. In addition, we need also to consider the cost effectiveness in building and upgrading the pod. Shall we build a lot of pods or build a few with upgrade pods? We can build pods with upgrade enhancements if we have already bought an insurance to reduce the damage from the threat. The investment of time and effort to decide should be kept minimum or in other words, we need to react before the threat comes. I learn how to predict the accuracy of the risk, how to prevent and minimize the risk, how to react if the threat comes, and also measure the likelihood of type of the threat. \nWhen assessing the risk, we should take a look at several alternatives that can preserve our capital. I would add a bonus to increase our capital, so we can build and upgrade in a faster method. In addition, there should be another ways how to prevent the threat hitting us. For example, we can add more alternative ways to protect our pods. Not just the insurance to protect, but there should be another alternatives besides insurance to cover for the risk. Additional information such as how to measure the dependency of each move should be known to player so the player knows the likelihood of the threat, how strong is the threat so the player can prepare for an assessment to reduce the damage. In conclusion, Risk management is a good practice tool to increase our capital and at the same time to reduce damage. "

Initially  my   choice  was to  focus on protecting  the  structures  more than  anything  and spending heavily on insurance.    However after repeated efforts  to  finish a level, the  fact that  got  highlighted was the importance  of  knowledge of the  inevitable  impending disaster. Seeing that  disaster could not be avoided came the realization and clarity,that first most  important  thing is to understand the  risk. , then  how to reduce the effect of the risk and  lastly  handling  the after  effects The rate at which the  damages  were  repaired  directly affected to the availability of more resources.This is  what  one should look into.Just like  in a simple  case of  spread of a disease.Faster  the recovery rate, faster the people get back to work  and lower the chances of the  country  suffering from  economic crises due to  lower productivity of the  population The cost in terms of insurance and protection  reduced  tremendously the moment  I understood the  point behind the research of the  comets.  Playing this  game over and over again was  a learning experience  and  the biggest lesson being  the trade off  between protection  against risk and preparedness.  It is better to be  prepared than  be over protected, The opportunity  cost  lost is more  when  you are over protected  than you are prepared. As one is more  prepared,  the impact of the disaster  gets lesser. The reason being that  as  development  takes place based on   continuous research of the  comets,  one is able  to  build structures  that  can  withstand the effect and  hence lesser  expenses  in rebuilding. This  saving can be further  put  back into developing structures  which are  stronger. If i was to play  the  game again,  I would  pay more emphasis  to  first  get knowledge on the  impending  disaster, research and then look into  ways to mitigate the disaster. Natural disasters can neither be predicted nor be quantified. Depending on the  geography of the  place, economic and social systems  need to be put in  place  whereby the whole community works together. Knowledge of the topography  and  climate  conditions will help  as well. However one  point  after playing this  game that  comes  to  my  mind  is that knowledge cannot be  applied  if the general  level of  education is low. So  one way of protection is to spend on educating the people.  The  change  I would propose is some sort of warning systems, like a siren, when the comets  are visible. so  the  sense of sound can also  be used."

It covered all of the components of risk management, from preparation to coping. It seemed easy at the beginning, having a set amount of money is easy to concentrate only on building and development. In my opinion the most important thing is to find a balance between spendings on development and protection. One of the crucial trade-offs was to put development on hold for a moment in order to gain money for insurance. But it payed off. When disaster occurred it was much cheaper and faster to rebuilt, that proves the importance of insurance. It was similar with protection, thanks to the better protection effects were less painful. Gaining knowledge proved to be necessary to asses the risk and decide whether to put money in development or in protection/saving money in case of damages. In my case putting development on hold when big risk occurred and concentrating back on development right after the risk proved to be the most efficient strategy."

The game had all the elements of risk management as it required preparation that included developing enough pods to generate revenue\nflows needed to purchase protection and insurance well in advance and also involved coping with consequences once the shocks materialized like community connectedness. In a risky world (in the game) where comets with differing severity and probability\nare frequent, in order to develop, risks need to be managed proactively, systematically and in an integrated manner. Mismanaged risks prove to be costly, but the measures required to prepare better, like a higher insurance plan, in the game, also come\ncostly. In the game, the need to be constantly prepared was very striking. However, by investing in the protection and insurance, the costs of coping were beneficial and the repairs even after the shocks materialized were cheaper thus making preparation\nbeneficial vis a vis coping in the game. This was an important trade off that needed assessment of the incoming risk and the decision to invest in protection plans. However, when the severity and the probability of the shocks were low, the investments\nin the protection and insurance plans decreased but as the uncertainty of the risks curtailed the certain costs. Thus risk management requires considering different risks and the relative need of preparing for each of them. Also, choices had to be made\nbetween purchase of a higher plan of insurance or a higher plan of upgrade of pods that also depended on the certainty and severity of the incoming shocks. Investing in a higher insurance plan, well in advance would be the thing to be done differently\nif played the second time. After the first time, we ensured that more resources are invested in upgrading the pods in which investments had already taken place as they fetched more returns. This in turn helped invest in better risk preparation. Also,\nafter some time, it was realized that when enough money is not available, time can be utilized to lift the land, as it does not involve huge amount and is progressive. The key learning from the game was that once shock materialized, the coping in terms\nof community connectedness had to be very swift and efficient. This highlights the importance of trained human capital and planning assets deployment in the coping phase. Also, the shocks come with a signal or an indicator. But calamities can take place\neven without notice like the rare but severe ones. In such cases full proof preparation might not help and coping efficiently is the only alternative. Insurance is not a full proof protection. It only helps reduce or limit the damage. Probability (chance\nif hit) is only an indicator and it is very hard to forecast shocks. Constant alertness and preparation and building from the beginning are some of the key learnings. Also development of a pod takes time. We have to plan in such a way that the development\nwork is done with advance preparation and hence the need to manage time, which is also an important resource in risk management. The costs of developing various pods are similar in the game. This is not true in real life situations. In actual situations,\neven choices have to be made in differing development plans based on costs and thus the priorities of development have to be set up accordingly. This element of differing development costs needs to be added in the game.\n"

Because the pace of meteors were different from each other, thus if you didnt get prepared yourself to hit you could get damage. The other key message was related with the researching of each meteors. although at the beginning of the meteor appeared on the screen, their severeness was seemed little, however after making research about it its severeness increased when when it hitted, its damage was tremendous. By taking into consideration this point, i would say that making research is crucial unless you think that you are well prepared to unexpected risks. Last but not least point is after one meteors hit your land, your lands level decreases. It means that even you feel like you are well prepared for future risks, you should check your status after an unexpected event lived. For aforementioned reasons, this game learnt me the importance of research for risks, being prepared for everytime and also making ex-ante and post-ante analysis for risk events. "

Also what is the goal (should we make a large community or not?) is not fully clear. \n\nI firstly and primarily focused on research and probably spent too much money on it. Similarly I spent too much resources on prevention and insurance, limiting the availability of funds to build the community. \n\nThe games is interesting but it is not clear which shock and which risk management measure has bigger impact: i.e. cost efficiency of the different measures (research, protection and insurance) are not clear. The games also provides a simplified way of looking at risk management, which is in real world very complicated as actors do not make rational choices.  It would be interesting having to choose and make decisions in a more realistic settings, considering expenditures of jobs , education, health care etc. \n\nAs it is difficult to reach a higher level than level 3, and considering above comments I do not think it is fair to use the game results as part of the course grades.

Interestingly, as I was increasing levels, money wasn't an issue anymore (i guess this is an example of a developed country), and actually, i failed to pass to level 5, because i was over-protecting too much, when I should have use the money to upgrade the pods. I guess that my main outcome from this game is that at the beginning, when you were 'poor', it was way more difficult to balance my budget between creating pods and protecting from the meteorites, but as I was getting more money, it wasn't too difficult, and actually i was spending money on protection even if there were no meteorites on sight or the risk was quite low. "

Other than insurance and leveling up the ground, timing and doing research about the comets are very important parts that I need to aware of. Also, managing the money that i have is extremely important. Buying and leveling up were the preparation for the risk affect development. Wrong management with the money would delay investing on risk management tools such as insurance. I bought the insurance before taking any action on the game. After buying the insurance, I build the community with confidence because I know that if I loose anything from any disaster, my insurance covers up the damage. This gives me confidence and more brave steps to take for the next level. Of course just buying an insurance is not enough because after the disaster, you loose time and effort even the insurance covers the damage but insurance does not give me the time that I lost building again. That is why, besides buying the insurance, getting the ground level higher that the water is very important to minimize the risk.

It shows that you have to make choices, indeed, and I found myself more focussing on the protection and not so much on the insurance and knowledge. It was interesting that on the higher levels however, also the insurance became necessary because there were more and more higher risks of getting hit. I was mostly assured by the effect that protection has: it is an investment that you do in the beginning with a long term effect that is relevant also for future risks. The knowledge is only relevant for that particular risk and therefore less efficient. The insuarnce again is long term although its coverage changes depending on the development of the locality.\nThe first time I played, I did not know what the research did to the possibility of reducing the effect of a hit, so that helped the second time. I also improved on building faster because without that the level can not be concluded. It became quite easy to reach the higher levels once I found out what the best strategy was. \nI think it is a bit too simple. I would rather keep level one as it is but instead of increasing the number of comets in the higher level, I would prefer to increase the complexity, for example by forcing to make more choices based on the costs (there was not much limit in spending in the game that I played) and considering relocation or different types of protection. Another type of risk could also be interesting to have to deal with because often places have multiple issues and have different ways to protect against them. \nIn the place I live, protection and preparation would be the main actions to migitate. Preparation in order to cope better is not part of the game, but would also  be relevant. Lastly, social, political, cultural factors are not taken into account. \nAltogether, I think the game gives a nice impression but it is too much simplified which makes it look too easy. It is like other computer games, I guess, that do not reflect the reality."

In other words, the role of risk management here was to decrease the damage to Alora’s development that a cometary impact could potentially have, thus safeguarding not only the process of development and progress but ultimately the survival of Alora itself. Risk management was intended here to either protect Alora’s development entirely from the damage caused by a cometary attack or at least help it prepare for and cope more easily (that is, quickly and cost-effective) with the damages caused by the cometary impact so that Alora could recover quickly and cost-effectively from the negative shocks of a cometary impact and develop its society further. Following the logic of a virtuous circle, the more cost-effective the recovery (if any recovery was necessary at all), the more resources were available to invest both in further protective measures against future cometary impacts (thus indirectly safeguarding the development and survival of Alora) as well as in further direct societal development. There was a constant trade-off between allocating resources to direct development or allocating resources to instruments of risk management instead. While the priority was the development and survival of Alora, such development was only possible by protecting the community from and preparing the community for the repercussions of the cometary impacts. Another trade-off was between the various actions of preparation (ex ante risk management). The challenge was to balance appropriately between gaining knowledge (about the estimated severity and probability of actual impact) by virtue of research, protecting the community of Alora by raising the platform upon which the community was built (thus lowering the probability and size of a potential damage), and insuring the community from potential damages caused by the cometary impacts (by purchasing an insurance now to make a potentially necessary recovery less expensive in the future). Preparation for risk affected development at all times – while in the short-term resources potentially available for development were invested in risk management measures instead, in the long-term such investments proved not only to be highly cost-effective but to ultimately safeguard the further development and survival of Alora.\n\nWith each restart of the game I learned to better balance my allocation of resources between (1) risk management (indirect development) or direct development as well as between (2) research, protection, and insurance. Most importantly, I learned that research (even if its results are merely estimations rather than certainties) is a necessary prerequisite for more informed decisions about how to allocate your limited resources.\n\nLiving close to a river within an area that has become increasingly prone to floods, to better represent the risk management choices that my community faces I would change the initial negative shock in the Risk Horizon game from cometary impacts to rainfall.

As soon as the light turned blue, I\nstopped pressing the slider to buy more pods. And there were comets, too and\nthe power lost due to their collision with the land was the risk of this game. So\nhere comes the risk management: I have to confront the fact that soon or later,\nthere will be comets hit my land and I need to prepare for the collision( like\nbuying as much insurance as I can or increase the level of protection) and try\nto minimize the loss. In account of the power growth, my principle was like\nthis: if the possibility to hit was below three notches, I would research it\nuntil the level prevailed over the possibility. However, if the serenity of the\nhit was far below my level of protection( like one or two notches), while the\nchance of hit was really high, I would just ignore it since researching it\nwould be ineffective as well as time-consuming.

The trade-off is not only beetween risk and opportunity, but also beetween the three different risk management tools. You need a cost-effective combination of protection (to neutralize low and middle severity comets), knowledge (to know comets' severity and to face short-term risks, gaining more time to create connections in the Community) and insurance  (to reduce the damage of middle and high severity comets and to reduce the decrease of development). The Power of Protection is the long-term prevention tool, so it lasts between a round and the other, but it's cost is increasing with the level of protection. In case of emergency (high severity comet incoming). The key is to increase it in order to focus on development and only in high risk cases (high severity comets) manage the short-term treat. Knowledge (research) is important to do the right short-term decision. It's also important to keep a sufficient buffer of \"money\" to be flexible."

Meteors serve as a danger to\nthe settlement, with each one having the capacity to crash into the ocean,\ncausing harm to the settlement. Each meteor has a meter for severity, chance of\nhit, and research. A meteor may or may not hit, and may or may not cause harm. Methods\nof damage control include research and elevation. By clicking an individual\nmeteor, it is “researched” as time progresses, and can only be research one at\na time, demanding full attention. More research allows the player to connect\neach pod in a random-lit order during a longer time limit after a meteor\nstrikes. The more connections made, the more damage is mitigated, with the\npossibility of no damage. Elevation, like researching, will demand all of your\nattention. But unlike researching, which is initiated with a small fee, elevation\ncosts money in short, regular intervals. The benefit of elevation is that it\nprovides protection from water damage for a series of meteors, while research\ndoesn’t. Research, however, provides a chance of no damage, while elevation\nwill simply moderate damage broadly. The last element of the game is insurance\nfor pod damages, which comes in three plans, and increase in cost each level."

The three key elements of risk management namely knowledge, protection and insurance formed the basis of any strategic decision making. It clearly demonstrated the difficulty of maintaining a balance between the three elements and on top of that the pressure of the need for further development. Seizing opportunities of cheap upgrades to the development was not always possible as more often than not, due to a lack of resources, development had to halt for the benefit of the highest possible insurance. So in return, once sufficiently insured one was almost lacking behind in development, played the other way around though meant  gaining a state-of-the-art development which was falling prey to the next shock and too expensive to rebuild without insurance. That said, even with insurance, if not enough importance had been placed on gaining knowledge, there was not enough time to tighten community structures in order to successfully rebuild the development. In other words, the aspect of coping after a shock played a vital role alongside knowledge gaining, protection building and securing insurance as well. I played the game a couple of times. At the beginning I focused on building as many different units as possible. This strategy worked fine in the first two levels but it became clear soon after that upgrades are desperately needed before they grew too expensive to shoulder. From then on I focused on a few units but upgraded them as soon as possible. Constant high insurance was another priority and making sure there were always enough resources to finance new insurance when needed (at the beginning of each new level) often meant not being able to develop further. The main thing I have learned is that although you might mean well, focusing on only one aspect of development has fatal effects. I you see each level as a term in office of a government you can understand how they would like to focus on building as much as they can as that is what is visible to the population, leaving future governments to invest in knowledge and insurance. Being short sighted is tempting but a balanced combination of gaining knowledge (of the nature of risks involved as well as its possible effects), protection (upgraded development structures, strong communities) and sufficient insurance is essential.\nAs I live in Europe, the resent developments in the Eurozone suggest that we are at a high risk of overspending. So if I could change one simple thing in the game, I would let contenders apply for credit that has to be paid back with interest at certain times. That way the temptation of building more than own resources permit is raised and the difficulty of letting “later generations” deal with repercussions of overspending is added to the resilience of the developments.\n"

The choices I made was to try and increase the level of pod I had while maintaining at least 33% of the insurance and trying to research as much as I could about the asteroid.  If an asteroid did do damage, I was always most concerned about fixing up the pods immediately in order to create less damage the next time.  I thought this was important because having more and more damage was too high of a risk for me.  If I were to play the game again, I would definitely do more research on each of the asteroids that came through.  Some were hard as they were moving to fast but I thought it would be more beneficial to have as much information as possible.  I learnt that it was a balance between how much insurance to have - I typically started out with only 33% insurance - and how much damage was actually done.  I found that the more research I was able to do, the better as I was able to build more connections which allowed less damage to occur. Only towards the end of the game I felt more insurance was necessary as research and community building was very hard to do.  I don't think I would change anything in the game. I felt that it captured risk management very well and how it is always changing.  This came in the variances of speed of the asteroids and how it allowed for a lot or very little research.  I think that the game represented risk management very well.  The only criticism I had of the game was how fast the money kept coming in. I felt that by the end of the game, I would have been able to have the fullest protection again the asteroids without any problems, therefore created almost no risk.  Overall, I think the game portrayed how risk management is always changing and how hard it is to determine the outcome of a disaster, especially when it appears as if it is going to miss and then ends up hitting and causing more damage than expected.  I found the game to be very useful though and was able to show me how I manage risk and my thoughts and reactions to it."

I found it much easier to do well in the game if you did not have to rely on the insurance, but instead invest more upfront and make sure you had cash reserves, that way you didn't get stuck waiting for your investments to start making you money again. I played the game multiple times and noticed that you had to balance your time and money to be successful, this is quite similar to real life. You must make trade offs and choices, sometimes you won't know until after the fact if it was the right thing to do.  Sometimes I purchased insurance and then did not need it, but the downside to not having insurance and needing it made me fail the first time I played. If I were helping to develop a new version of the game, I would make the costs of various choices more transparent. It's hard to see how much you are spending on various risk management features, should you upgrade or build more pods, which have a higher return? Should I buy the insurance or build up the island?

It is always vital to research the factors of danger, which were comets in the game, as well as possible. Making sure to prepare using the information received from research can greatly aid one in preparing a solid and suitable contingency plan. However, research is not infallible, and original forecasts may be well off the mark. By the time you realize that the forecast is off, it may be too late to implement the necessary risk management policies. This occurred a few times in the game, where the severity of a comet may have been judged to be much lower than the actual severity. Unfortunately, I focused on short term gain (rapid development of the pods), rather than establishing a framework in which long term prosperity could be achieved. This event taught me the importance of insurance, where the costs in the event of a disaster are shared and this can prevent a large chunk of money from being suddenly spent. This approach definitely conserves more resources than a short-term one.\nAnother lesson was that preparation must also be made for low probability events, which may cause severe damage if neglected. One particular incident in the game brought my attention to this point: a comet with an almost filled damage bar had only 2 bars of “chance to hit” filled, but it hit Alora anyway. It caused severe damage and it was very difficult to get back on track. It would have been more frugal for me had I set better protection and invested in insurance. From this game, I learnt that while proactive risk management may cost a large sum in the present, it will set a solid framework for future development.\nFurther, I also found the approach to spread out developments to be more effective in beating the game. Perhaps this is also true for real life; spreading out developments prevents dualism from occurring in an economy, such as an advanced, rich manufacturing sector and a backwards, poor agricultural sector. As the old adage goes “don’t put all your eggs in one basket”. \nOne extra feature that could possibly improve the game is the implementation of more risks. The risk management in this game is currently one dimensional and does not represent the multitude of risks a certain economy faces. \n"

Risk, in this game, is a combination of likelihood of comets hitting the community and the severity of the consequence. In order to reduce the negative effect brought by the comets, the very first thing I did was to purchase the highest insurance coverage, which is 75%. Upgrading the pots was important because a community can be formed accordingly, and the power of community can be used to against the natural disasters. So whenever I had money after building a pot, I upgraded it. Trade-offs need to be made while performing risk management. Building as many pots as possible is good to the economy, but money needs to be saved on improve the bar of the silder. Spending time on research of the comets can help to increase time to build the community, reduce the severity of the comet hits and chances of comets hitting the ground, however, time needs to be alloted to increase the level of the slider to match with the severity level of the comet. Preparations of risk affect development either immediately, or after sometime. Community bonding acts immediately once a comet hits the ground. Damage can be spread over the whole community by clicking on the glow. Insurance was purchased beforehand in order to minimize possible damages happening in the future. Slider protection was prepared according to the status of the comet. It needed to be raised at least to the severity level of the comet damage. I played the game a couple times. The first time I tried, I didn't even pass level one. I realized that I didn't do enough research on the comets, instead, I continuously raised the slider way above the level needed to cover the comet damage. Money wasn't well spent and economy didn't get improve because of the lack of pots built in a community. Risk management is a balance act. In order to do well in risk management, one cannot focus on one apsect related to risk, but pay attention to all the factors and plan strategically and wisely. Time management is certainly important. Doing one thing ahead of another does make a difference. If I were to make some changes of the game, I would probably try to speed up the construction of pots, the faster pots are built, the faster they could be connected in a community to function together to avoid and reduce risk. I could probably use big data to find out which area has the highest probablity hit by the comet, thus upgrades of that pot could be taken as priority. "

In order to ensure proper risk management I had to choose between building more communities so that each of the community members would act as each other’s protector, or building a few communities and instead keeping more resources to protect against the risk of being hit and incurring losses, this involved . As I prepared for risk management, I engaged in research to understand the nature and strength of the comets that were coming. I also took on insurance to protect against any damages that would occur. However, I did not take enough insurance that would be commensurate with the level of damages that eventually occurred. I also engaged in reinforcing the structures already built instead of building more communities that would support each other in the event of a disaster, such as when the comets struck. \nIn this case, I played the game thrice. In the first case I lost. The reason being, I concentrated on research and insurance, and did little to develop the community. Here I ended up being hit and lost nearly 50% of developments. In the second and third attempts where I won both level one and level two, what I did differently was to balance between using resources to build communities and buying insurance. Whereas in the first case I bought insurance haphazardly, in the second and third trials, I ensured that the amount of insurance I bought was commensurate with the level of threat that was coming. In this way, I did not incur sever loses even when the comets hit. \nIn my place, the risks of either floods or drought are the most common. Therefore, the changes that would be relevant are twofold. First, the comets should be made to depict whether it’s coming with dry winds and therefore drought or coming with lots of moisture and rain clouds, hence lots of rain and floods. The risk management choices necessary would then be either to  choose the type of crops to plant where there will be less or short rainy season or to build levees and other types of protection in case of heavy rains with floods and mudslides. Options of insurance would also be appropriate choices for risk management. In severe cases, long term strategy to settle in less prone areas and ensuring strong buildings would be necessary choices.\nJohn-Bosco Amuno\n"

The game shows how importnat is to find the right balance between these three elements because a perfect knowledge needs time and it is also necessery to build protection, so is importnt to make a decision about how to spend time. Another trade off is about money because both insurance and protection are expensive and resource are limited. moreover they also have an impact on the development of the village: money are actually necessary also for development. as we learned in a past video, this is a obstacle for risk management because in the short term there are only costs that are visible (less resources for development) and it is posible to see benefits only after some time. Although the protection and the insurance have a central role in the village's growht. Furthermore information allow to understand the level of risk and what risk management tools are better to use. It is a necessary and essential part of risk management.

The risk posed to the progress bar filling up through building and progression comes in the form of comets and meteors flying at different speeds and having different values for severity and chance of contact. All Risk management is reflected in Risk Horizon through the three options of security through buying insurance on the damage caused by the comets, preparing for the risk before knowing it will happen by raising the platform, and coping with risk by conducting research on the comets as they are falling to improve the chances of having no damage. Preparation for risk using any of the three methods had the opportunity cost of not being able to spend the money used on protection for development or new construction, and even though research was free, while the research window was open no other game actions could be completed and therefore development was slowed in the short term by managing risk. In the long term development of the pods, risk management made growth possible since the effects of comet hits would be minimal and more money would be available continually. "

By using\ninsurance to mitigate the costs of damage by paying a small upfront cost for\nthe policy, I thought the settlement was better off. However, the insurance was\nonly helpful because there was so much damage, and repairing the houses after\neach meteor strike became very expensive. I thought it was better to insure\nagainst the potential damage from a meteor, rather than to invest heavily in\nraising the protection level for the entire settlement. But protecting the\nentire settlement, while expensive and subject to degrading over time, did a\nmuch better job of mitigating damage and thus decreasing the repair costs. I\nalso did not realize how valuable knowledge would be because of its link to\ncommunity connections.  Ultimately, the\nresearch (knowledge) of meteors was the most effective tool because I was able\nto use the knowledge to adjust the protection level and determine the best time\nto buy insurance. The community connections after each strike also prevented\ndamage costs more than once. "

I have made several attempts\nafterwards but got no progress to the 4th level.  Feeling frustrated, however, it made me\nrealized that failure doesn’t stop me from finding ways to improve my risk\nmanagement skills. It was difficult for me to find the perfect balance yet;\nmaybe when I get more in-depth study on risk management should I be able to\nimprove. "

Alongside\nbuilding and upgrading the pods that would increase the rate of development,\nrepresented by the development bar on the left, there was a need to watch out\nfor comets that were what we call shocks in reality. This accounts for\nobstacles and constraints that stand in the way of responsible and effective\nrisk management, and tackling them. In an attempt to keep a balance between\ndevelopment and preparing for risks, I had to distinguish between three\ndifferent risk management activities; research, also known as knowledge in\nreality, protection and insurance. Using the power of research by keeping the\ncomet’s box focused on the screen for as long as I could, I acquired as much\nknowledge as I could about the approaching comet (shock), assessing its\nseverity and chances of hit. In the first few attempts of the game I would\nspend only a two or three bars on research, however after a couple of tries, I\nrealised prolonging the time spent on research had a positive effect, reducing\nthe impact on the pods as I attained more time to connect to communities just\nbefore the comet would hit. However, the challenge I faced was that the more\ntime I spent on research, the more I was compromising on the time that could be\nspent on protection. Although in the first few tries of the game, I did spend\nrelatively more time on protection, in the latter few tries, I spent more time\non research as mentioned above. Given a number of insurance plans to choose\nfrom, what I had to consider was the amount of resources available at hand.\nTorn between choosing an effective insurance plan and protection that was\ndraining resources, I would choose to employ the insurance plan that may have\nbeen the most expensive at times but in the long-term it turned out to be the\ncorrect decision, as it reduced the cost of repairs for the damage caused by\nthe comets. This signifies the importance of long-term planning. At times, due\nto shortage of resources, I had to choose the cheapest insurance plan in the\nbeginning, but as I gained resources by developing and upgrading the pods, I\nwould change my insurance plan to a new and improved one. And on the other\nhand, at times due to a huge chunk of my resources being spent on the insurance\nplan, there was a lack of resources, limiting my ability to upgrade the pods,\nthus slowing the pace of development of the community. I learned that risk\npreparation is highly correlated with income, and most importantly there is a need\nof careful planning and management to balance the time and resources available\nin a framework of obstacles, by thinking more strategically about the return\nover a long period of time. Moreover, to better represent the risk management\nchoices that matter, I would propose to add another aspect of risk management\nthat deals with a positive change such as technological improvement or a\nresource boom, and an indication of how to take advantage of it, clearly indicating\nthe significance of developing upon new opportunities alongside threats.  "

Chance of hit is not always 100% as the risk might me higher at first but as time comes the possibility of hitting decrease but it is not the reason to stop protection. However, protection is very cost full and undermines development but the more protection gives back the damages which might be done in the future without re investing again. Also as you invest in protection of higher risk when the information from the research is highly sufficient, it reduces the damages of higher risk in front  and other small upcoming risks with similar features. It is like killing more than one birds by a one stone. "

Some people may be vulnerable—that is, especially susceptible to losses from negative shocks—as a result of their exposure, internal conditions, and risk management.\n\n Second Lesson : Risk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the ability to cope once a risk has materialized. Preparation (or ex ante risk management) includes a combination of three actions that can be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge, obtaining protection, and obtaining insurance.This is what is known as the interlinked components of risk management.\n\nThird Lesson: Protection and insurance can provide complementary means of managing risk\nProtection can decrease the likelihood of very severe losses, thereby increasing the probabi-lity of routine losses relative to extraordinary losses. \n\nFourth lesson :\nRisk management is cost-effective—yet not always feasible Not only can risk management save lives, avert damages, and unleash opportunities, but preparation for risk often has high returns. \n \nIf I were to play this game a second time, I will first focus on three main things. First knowledge of the type of risk ; then preparation in order to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits ; and finally I will insist on insurance so as to face  potential outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty.\nWhat change would I propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live? I will design a game that reflect the reality of my own context, that is focussing on risks that people may encounter in my own environment.\n"

The preparation required, i.e. knowledge, protection and insurance all have opportunity costs in terms of the money required to acquire each of them.

Protection was also useful, but you could not further development and build at the same time. Insurance was a hefty up front cost, but I was glad that I had it when disaster struck. Overall, it was tricky balancing the needs for development with preparation for risk, especially as the payoffs we're not immediately felt.\n\nI played the game twice. The first time I was too focused on averting risks, so I spent too much time and money on protection, insurance and knowledge and neglected the development of my pods. The second time, I realised that a more balanced approach was necessary if I wanted to succeed in the game. This helped me to realise that often we lose opportunities because we are only concerned about downside risks, but it is important to grow as we'll  otherwise risk management has no purpose. I also appreciated the importance of protection and knowledge over insurance as I felt that these methods were more long-term and yielded better results than simply insuring against the risk. \n\nIn a new version of the game, I would highlight the community aspect of risk management. Although tis was somewhat included within the knowledge/ research  tool, I feel that it is a distinct part of risk management. Especially in small developing communities, social networks are paramount to survival and people and the ecosystem are one and the same. \n\nOverall, the game was a simple yet effective way of demonstrating how risk management integrates with development."

During the game, I had to make several choices, including whether to spend my wealth on upgrading existing pods or developing new pods, whether to spend my limited time on protection or research, and whether to take a chance and develop/upgrade a pod or wait until the comet attack is over. Some trade-offs I made were balancing research with protection and protection with insurance. Preparation for risk affected development in several ways. First, whenever I spent money on protection, the bar's color would turn redder, meaning that my development wasn't going well. However, protection, research, insurance, and community connections also prevented and lessened the damage of the comet attacks, benefiting development. "

It also provoked an assessment of the  trade-offs to be taken when making decisions regarding risk management – especially in cases when resources are constrained. For example – does one invest in infrastructure (housing/ pods or broad protection) or does one invest in insurance? The game also made me choose between investing precious time in research or spending time in other activities such as building/ development, buying insurance or developing protection.\n\nThe more prepared I was for an event – through research, protection and by having insurance – the better I withstood the events. The community links were stronger and I was able to build on the community links after an event. This, together with insurance meant that the damage I sustained was much less when hit by a severe meteor. It also cost less to invest in broad societal protection, low insurance and research (which 'cost time') than paying for high insurance. I was finally able to advance higher in the game when I paid less for higher insurance and put more money into development (by spending more on pods) and by increasing protection for society (to prevent the negative event). The rewards or benefits were higher for reducing risk for society as a whole and developing it than for trying to deal with the consequences of a negative event. \n\nI did better when I had a higher level of development. Income was higher when I had more pods and when I had invested more in the pods. This generated more income for me and society prospered.\n\nI was able to gain more time to build community connections after I was struck by an event when I had spent more time researching an event. When I had more time building community connections after being struck by a negative event, the damage was often less severe. This was not only beneficial in terms of sustaining less damage, but it also helped in that I was able to focus on developing my island and preparing for other negative shocks.\n\nA lesson I learned was that the solution is not found in any one component, and that trade-offs are constantly being made in a changing context and under time constraints. This means that risk management practitioners have to be constantly analysing risks and opportunities, as well as changing obstacles to addressing or acting upon those risks and opportunities.\n\nI had played the game a few times and I tried a number of strategies to ensure success. However, I found that the game, like life, is somewhat unpredictable. I did find increased success with more development, research and more community connections. The game also highlighted the obstacles facing risk management. For example, time pressure made it more difficult to choose and undertake activities. \n\nIf I had to change on thing in the game to better capture one thing that captures risk management where I live, I would add a component to differentiate according to class and gender. Where I live, poor people and women are significantly worse affected by risk shocks than rich people and they take longer to recover. The game could demonstrate this by, for example, showing some pods being worse affected than others and taking a longer period to rebuild. Pods could also be different colours to show different genders."

The task is simple, build a new prosper community facing crisis that occur on the horizon. These crises have a certain possibility of occurrence and we can tackle them to an extend by learning from the past crises and preparing for the new ones. The goal was to achieve development by taking the necessary risks and preparing for the crisis. So instead of ad-hoc measures, when it became clear that a meteor will hit the colonists applied a standard risk management plan. To achieve this we started to produce wealth to be able to grow and to prepare, there was a federal reserve of couple of hundred points to be able to invest-insure-repair if necessary. After the first hit, although we had a good insurance it was clear that only with insurance it not going to work so the “early observation”  plan was implemented. As a meteor-crisis appeared on the horizon it entered under evaluation in terms of chances of hit and the severity of the impact and speed. Depending of the 3 combined characteristics different risk management options have been implemented, combining the tools of insurance with research, insurance with protection or in the cases of systemic risk which could have send us back in the stone ages of Alora insurance-research and protection combined was used. These preparations where needed to be done in a way not to hinder development. By insurance coping was much easier, lower loss of development and lower cost of repairs. By investing in research some crisis where tackled without any losses. \nAfter the first attempt to settle, the policy of investing in insurance and research was changed. It was a shift from investment to early insurance, but less effective to buying insurance later on but with higher coverage of the risks. We the colonists learned that only by insurance we are not going to survive so we started to invest in research to, as it became very cost effective. Investment in protection was possible after reaching a level of development, protection made it possible to resist to high severity crisis or at least to reduce the impact of it.\nFor Risk Horizon 2.0 to develop Alora I would implement a different way of approach of the consequences of a hit by meteor. Meaning that now the pods are affected in the same way by hit, I would implement a different scale of damage and price to build depending how close or far are from the shore. This would mean that there is a global policy regarding the early warning system, but different policies regarding where to build, where to upgrade the pods and how much to pay for insurance. So a local policy (regarding building to the shore) would be fit in the global policy of how to tackle the impacts of the meteors."

Never the less, I have to admit that I realized that the insurance and the protection are directly related, if I had more protection, I could get a cheaper insurance, this is risk management.

The role of risk management made clear that if you don't protect yourself through gaining knowledge of the chance and the severity of the comet hitting, your work on developing your buildings will suffer proportionally to the missing knowledge, protection and insurance. Of course, you can't always have all you want. That's why your rate of development decreases for a period of time, in order to pay for the insurance (I usually bought the insurance at the beginning of the game. 2nd level - 25%, 3rd level -50%, 4-5 - 75%), and increasing your protection. But the outcomes of such a temporary loss are greater than their neglecting. I can't compare the superiority of either insurance or protection, since I played only 1 game; but I can say that for me, insurance was on the second plan, even though I bought it first. I didn't want to risk the huge damage a severe comet would cause for developing 1 or 2 building. I'm sure it would've cost me much more in the end. And so, I put my emphasis on protection. Even though it diminishes your rate of development, when a comet hits, the damage done is less than without protection, or even none, and the money difference from a 50% and 5% can then be reinvested in developing your buildings, buying better insurance, and/or improving your current level of protection. I guess the incentive to get through as many levels as you can, pushes you to risk in favour of the development. I thought of strategising my actions as follow. As long as a comet didn't have a 40+ chance of hitting and severeness of 3 bars, I continued developing, knowing that my insurance and protection are more than enough to have no damage, or subsequently very little reparation. But if the comet had a very high level of severeness, even with a small chance of hitting, I worked on protection, knowing that even if it doesn't hit now, so I will be both prepared in advance and having the opportunity to develop the building without losing anything when the next one came. I can therefore say that thinking ahead and rationalising that the cost you pay now, will save you more than 100% of the money invested plays a key role on how people approach risk management."

While they can miss the pods they can also cause a great deal of damage with both direct contact and after shocks. Since there was already a high risk which could not be controlled the pods insurance was of utmost importance. Insurance offered immediate results. If I was to play the game only one time I would make sure that there were many basic pods with as much insurance as I could afford. With each time I played the game I improved on both placement and improvement of pods. By placing pods a little further apart and improving certain pods and not others I was able to minimize the cost of damage when a comet hit. Each time I played the game I learnt the value of vantage points. As you learn more about potential risks you get a different vantage point which allows you to assess risk better. With each failure you have more information to better protect yourself in the future. I learnt the value of implementing research with each comet, preparing for the severity and likelihood of that comet hitting the pods and causing damage. I also learnt the value of repairing the damage as quickly as possible. I was able to ignore low risk comets and keep investing in strengthening the infrastructure of my buildings but at the same time get into high gear using reserves to add more protection for comets with a higher probability of hitting the pods and causing damage. While improvement was important after the pods were built it was also important to have enough money to insurance protection as research on comets indicated a higher probability of hitting the pods and causing damage. I would add the feature of walls and placement of the pods. This will allow stronger protection and also placement that may prevent all the pods from getting damaged when one was hit. Flooding would be an immediate problem in the place that I live. Given the fact that global temperatures have changed in recent years and there is a lot more rainfall in my area it would be wiser to prepare for flooding of homes. I would propose that research is done on adequate drainage in the area which will allow collected water and heavy rainfall to be funneled away from homes. I would also propose that homes are fully insured for flooding and water damage. "

To win the game, the resources at disposal, energy and money, had to be spent in order to reach a required level of development after each turn. It was therefore necessary to grow enough to reach the requirement, while at the same time taking the sustainability of this growth into account. In Risk Horizon, the main challenge to reach this development level necessary to advance a level were external shocks in the form of meteors. A challenge here is that the player does not have information about the patterns of these shocks which seems to occur randomly. Nor is the severity or the risk of shocks hitting known before at a rather late. Therefore, the player had to carefully calculate how to spend money and resources on insurance, protection and research. There are some trade-offs between development and preparation as well as some trade-offs between the different kinds of preparation."

Since development cost money it was necessary for one to\ndistribute the available amount between the development investment and either\nrising the living space to save the house from floods or researching the\nincoming threats. The main focus was for me to develop the houses to meet the\nlevel goals. Because of this I started and build only a few settlements in the\nbeginning to see how costly their upgrades would be. After this I started to\nresearch the meteoroids, focusing on the once with the higher damage and/or hit\nthreat. Furthermore it was important for me to make sure my houses were at least\ninsured to a rate of 50%. Even though I did this in every level, I only needed\nthe insurance’s help in the first round, since I waited with rising the living\narea until the second stage. I have the feeling, that it was very important to\nhave the financial security the insurance offered me and paid me back 50% of\nthe damaged. This gave me the opportunity to invest more money in the buildings\nand in particular in research.  After\nhaving played the game I realize that rising the living area above ground is a measure\nto safe the settlement in last second but at the same time comes at a high\ncost. The cultural development is stalled for the moment and money is lost in\nthe process. After a while it became more important for me to focus on research\nand leveling the buildings, though I did not follow this insight enough in my\nlast round and sacrificed too much of my money and even more of my development\non rising the ground, which lead to failing the round’s goal within the set\ntime limit. The most (cost-) effective measure really was to do proper research\non the relevant threats. This way I could avoid most damages to my houses just\nbe being reasonably prepared. Concluding from these experiences and since I\nplayed the game only once I would definitely only rise the ground/protection in\nthe first and second round. Research and quick response in the case of a hit\nseem to be the better choices in respect of developing the houses in the given\ntime limit. The concept of “protection” was not really clear to me right from\nthe beginning and I needed to figure out was the switch was doing, what\neventually hampered my development. In addition I think the emergency mechanic\nof connecting the houses in case of a hit seems to be a bit clumsy even though\nthe idea behind it is absolutely reasonable. "

To clarify, I was able to understand the prediction\nof shocks by observing the comets’ severity and hitting chances as I controlled\nmy internal resources to reduce the uncertainty such as researching and\nprotection. Moreover, the trade-offs while I was protecting my pods were\nresearching and developing/ building pods or vice versa. Therefore, as I kept\nexpanding and developing my pods I observed the external conditions (comets) and\ntook the most relevant action according to the severity and chances of the\ncomet to hit. Furthermore, when I realized the high possibility of a comet to\nhit I invested on insurances and increased my protection. However, the\npreparation for risk affect development did not propound an immediate response;\nincreasing the protection bar needed too much time and the more protection I\nhad the more I could cope with the risks of damages. Thus, I personally would say that having a long term\nview was the most important feature of the game. "

I guess I will go back to playing the game again and try this out! :)\n\nI also very much liked that you pointed out that time management is an essential part of risk management! I hadn't even thought about putting it that way!\n\nWhat could make your reflection even better? Hmm... Maybe your proposal of raising the funds if you were to be able to change something in the game. I think the limited funds we had for the game was one of the main elements. Like time management, management of your financial resources is also important and would probably also be limited in real life. If you had an endless amount of money you could invest in preparation, insurance and development at the same time - but this game was to show that it is immensely important to find a stable balance between these options...\n\nApart from that - great review!\nEnjoy the rest of your course!\n\nRegards,\nSophie",

I accidently ran on and played a second\ntime. I took more measured risk with the meteors and developed faster while trying to maintain a green bar as much as was feasible. My main learning was I tend to insure and protect against risk until I had a strong understanding of the effect of my actions.\nThen I try to maintain a productive balance while increasing development and opportunities where possible.

If I had to develop a new version of the game, I wanted to change the enviroment, using a real and not a fiction scenary, so the gamer could experiment a more real feelings in how to manage the risk management. further I had added more threats, such as earthquakes, rains, famine and wars, implementing them in the higher levels, and not repeat the same threats in all the levels added only the speed. so I think that this game as the course are the best exemplification of how a decision maker and generally the population had to manage the risk management, because beyond the quizzes, a real work and a direct taste is very important for a man that had to act to fight against the adversities, and in future had to support the society to prevent several threats.

I was purchasing insurance and did not get any points for it.  I am not a connoisseur for video games but this game did not offer any motivation at all. Again for instance there was no points for preparation to protect the pods.  Maybe it could have a choice for buying or creating greenhouses that are resistant to the dust the comet spreads or create a hybrid pod that survives the impact i.e. biotechnology. Overall the game as it stands is a poor measure of assessment."

The Game has also\nproven that even when preparation is extensive, information can still be\nimperfect or some risk events cannot be avoided at all – namely when 2 or 3\ncomets appear and there is not enough time to research them all (at least as\naccurately as we should). If such situation arises, we are bound to act based\non imperfect information but, if insurance and protection were adequately put\nin place before the event, we should deploy those tools and rely on its effectiveness.\nNaturally, if there’s some damage, which neither the protection nor the\ninsurance deployment are able to cover entirely, we will need to cope with the\nconsequences and decrease the event's impact as much as possible (which, in\nturn, should have been minimized by the correct preparation of the risk).

Regardless, I failed to pass Level 5 twice\nwhen a comet (out of a three-comet set) hit Alora by the end of the level,\nleaving me not enough time to cope with its consequences."

In contrast, Some risks are can predict must occur, strength are high, I have to prepare internal conditions to confrot those risks. but those strength are not high, I just stand by and watch those risks.

And knowing risks are  can make down uncertainty of them , Joining insurance is not always the correct answer, In the process of coping risks, I realize the importance of social infra working. If some society have enough reosurces to confront risks can concentrate on after occur risk, if not, we have to prepare about manging risk discover immediately. "

Risk Management in the game was about maintaining the right balance among knowledge, protection, and insurance – the tools of risk management. The tools had to be applied depending upon the nature of the threat, ranged from mild to severe. It built community’s resilience, thereby reducing the effects of adverse events, and provided them an opportunity for development. The communities faced and coped with risks for a fixed duration, making the time management for each and every action extremely crucial.  \nThe choices that were needed to make during the course of the game were dependent on many factors including severity, current level of protection, and probable time with which the comet was supposed to hit the ground, while making sure that the progress of the development of the community was being met with in the allotted time to reach the next level. Therefore, how much amount of which activity needed to be done at what time was critical to ensure the development of the community. There were certain trade-offs that needed to be maintained among knowledge, protection, and insurance so that the task of developing and protecting a community does not seems to be elusive. Knowledge of the comet helped to know about the nature of the threat and the likelihood of the risk, thereby reducing uncertainty. Protection, another tool of risk management, aided in mitigating and sometimes in thwarting the adverse shocks. Insurance on the other hand certainly gave us a cushion to come back easily from the negative shocks, comets in our case, and ensured that growth of the community kept on increasing despite a setback. Now, the trick was managing the use of all these tools in such a way that would foster development in spite of certain hiccups. Protection, for instance, sometimes had to be avoided if the multiple severe comets were coming in which the possibility of serious damage is pretty high, then you would made a trade-off between knowledge and protection, especially when it is taking too much time to raise your protection level, leaving you with little time for other things. One of the main takeaways from the game is that to address any calamity successfully, it is indispensible to shift from ad hoc approaches to planned and pro-active approaches. It is imperative to be cognizant of the negative shocks, giving you the time to build community relations, but effects of those relations will largely remain transitory if they are not backed with a decent level of protection. \nFinally, had I been given a chance to add one more thing, it would be risk taking ability of the community itself that could very well be turned into an opportunity for development."

The most difficult decision that I have faced during the game is to find the balance between the short term development (trying to update pops and to increase the left bar) and the long term development (elevating the village in order to gain severity protection and to avoid the next waves in a easier way). However, it's not that easy because short and long term developments are not independent in the game (so neither in the real world) and to gain protection for a long term development means not to gain the sufficient \"energy\" for the bar to reach the next level.

Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk."

So, risk management involved a combination of prevention of such disasters and coping from the after effects. To save the community, I focused on doing a lot of research on the comets to understand their nature of causing devastation and accordingly took protection measures (alleviating the land to save the pods) and availing insurance as an incentive to re-build the destroyed pods at a cheaper price. The trade offs I faced while playing the game was that even if I did a lot of research on the falling comets to be alert and took protective steps to alleviate the land to save the pods, even then there was destruction. Also, insurance wasn't sufficient to repair the pods, it being expensive (as most of the money I spent on researching the comets, building pods and alleviating land for saving the pods from getting destroyed). Preparation for risk did impact development of the community as focus was shifted to building shock resilient pods which could withstand the natural calamity. Lot of resources were channelized in preventing the effects of the comets by undertaking research, protection and insurance. The resources foregone in preventing loss did slow down development initially but with time, a balance was achieved between minimizing the impact of the external environment (loss caused to the community due to falling comets) and boosting the resilience of the internal environment by building up the upgraded pods.  "

The trade offs were to take a calculated risk when the severity of damage / chances of hit were low and not go in for more protection during that time but rather wait for a bigger risk to add more protection. Sometimes this resulted in very minor damage, but that could be easily rectified. Preparation for risk was a sure impediment to development at the beginning as the progress was nil during preparation, but as the game progressed, it helped in faster progress as the damage was minimal to no damage as the preparation was very good."

I played the game more than once, the different things I have tried building few pods and developing them rather than building many at level 1, this meant to increase the value of the pods.In another trial I learned to study the severity of the meteors although sometimes the occurrence did not match the predictions and hence affected the preparation. I tried more protection another round but it was not worthy the resources used were not producing in return. In all these trials didn't forget the insurance cover. for the insurance cover to work well the severity of the hit a greater consideration.To propose a change in this game I would lower the costs of developing the pods once built. High costs set to develop a pod once built imply a greater loss incase of a meteor hit thus protection may take a greater part. Protection do not pave the way to pursue opportunities in some ways especially when time becomes a major constraint as it was in the horizon game."

So the purpose of the game was manage this risky situation using some of the tools we have learn in the course like: knowledge, protection, and insurance. In my case, the first choice I made was purchasing an insurance plan, so, in case of damage, I should not pay for all the repair costs, just for a little percentage of the damage and I saw it as an incentive to keep investing in more pods. Then, I wanted to protect the community to mitigate the damage if some  comet hit the surface. The last tool was about knowledge. I really believe about the importance of knowledge in risk management because it will help communities to know more about the potential damage that the risk can cause and it is a key tool for prevent and get prepared in the proper way to face trouble. In short, my strategy was trying to combine those ex-ante tools in a way that I would be sure that the community would not suffer from a shock, so it will keep on growing and developing to it’s fullest capacity and reach the highest score.

Raising the island cost money and time, and put development on hold; researching the comets was time-consuming and often took time away from planning or advancing pods; and purchasing insurance cost a significant amount of money that could have been put towards development. All three had an immediate effect in terms of their cost but a later, and usually larger, effect in terms of benefit or pay-off. In regards to choices, only one of the three could be pursued at a time, and the order in which they were pursued greatly impacted development and the player’s success in advancing to the next level. For example, in some levels it would have been possible to raise the island while you were still approaching the development goal, while in most levels it was only wise to do so after you reached your development goal and had extra savings/green to spare in case a comet hit and damaged your pods. Another choice that often had to be made was level of insurance - if a comet was approaching and likely to hit and damage your island, yet you could only afford the first level of insurance, it was best to purchase it but if you later wanted to upgrade to the highest level, you had to pay the full amount of the highest level, rather than the difference between the level you already had and the new one you were purchasing. Having played the game more than once, the first few times I assumed the best form of risk management would be to raise the island so as to prevent comets from hitting and damaging Alora at all. I didn’t realize how much it cost or how likely some comets were to hit and so I never advanced past the second or third level. After the first few times, the game became more stressful as I learned to appropriately balance the amount of time and money I spent on each of the three resources. Oftentimes, I learned that it would be wisest to purchase insurance first then research the closest comet as much as possible and make sure my developments were in green before I attempted to raise the island - there were a few times when I didn’t even get to raise the island at all during the level.This really helped me understand the concept and possible disadvantages of behavioral biases. If I could change one simple thing about the game, it would be the community connections part. I would make it so it would not only be tied to research, but was instead a general part of the game also somehow tied to protection and insurance. Also, I would try to make it so that it is not all or nothing - for example, I would vary the damage so that not all pods/communities are damaged completely or at all. The game would be too overwhelming if each pod had its own form of insurance, research and/or protection, but it would still be helpful to make the point that not all communities are impacted equally and that not all communities collaborate in the same ways."

Regarding to severity and chance of hit, I could estimated potential and have actions to grow our community. After having some shocks, I tried to recover the damaged and boosted protection by building new plots and facilities. Another important fact is cost analysis in the game. After each hit of comets, I needed to spent money to recover the damage. Obviously, if you are not financially secure for risks, you can not protect and rebuild your community. In my first play, I didn't pay attention for insurance plan, therefore it was financialy hard to replace my loss. In next game, I was so carefully when I manage repair cost. To get more benefits, having a really good insurance plan is also very significant as much as having useful knowledge, protection plan and coping plan. I think that another important part is having institutional response to get more advantages and to decrease possible loss. When I moved to higher levels of the games, I noticed having more pods helped me a lot to have more green areas and to mitigate the level of damage. "

For instance,timely\npurchase of insurance in the game provided an effective backbone to help build on knowledge\nand protection, albeit at a significantly higher cost. However, the benefit-cost\nratio in the eventuality of comet collisions was well worth the investment in\ninsurance. Given the limited availability of time, I found that ‘protection’\noften appeared to be the least favored preparation method on account of its\ntime consuming nature. This could well be viewed as an obstacle to effective\nrisk management as discussed in Chapter 2 of the World Development Report.\nKnowledge however, proved to be a very powerful and cost effective tool when the\nresearch provided on comets was analyzed and utilized correctly. This reemphasized\nthe lessons in Chapter 1 of the report which talked of plain data not being a\nsufficient tool until it is meaningfully examined. As I went on to become better\nversed with the risk management tools at hand, I began to notice that the rate\nof development accelerated as well through more resilience to shock from protection\nand research and lesser post-shock costs from timely insurance purchase."

The real strategy was to understand the threat from the 'Specific' comets and plan on protection/insurance accordingly. Early on, one can even take risk and 'wait-out' the comet hit to preserve the funds. If hit, the damage is minimal and if the comet misses, one can rapudly build out since the funds keep accumulating (unlike, insurance which requires funds even if you upgrade in the same level, and has to be repurchased at every level).",

By investing in the community development, which in turn increased the economic return, one had to an also invests in protection to reduce the propensity of a crisis, by avoiding negative impacts from the shock (the Asteroid hitting Earth). Whenever time was not enough to cover building protection, then insurance was a wise investment, which could reduce the amount needed to cover the damages, thus allowing you to keep developing at a constant speed, instead of spending large amounts in repair. Preparing for risk as investing on protection took some time and resources away from investment in development. Preparation was in the end the best type of investment to avoid the risk not only in response to the direct threat. It had to be done ahead of time, as sometimes a high-risk of impact and highly damaging meteor could come very fast. Therefore preparation ahead of time was necessary and it was the biggest differential factor, more than insurance, \n\n2.\tI played the game several times and once I realized that the trick was to invest in protection to avoid damages from meteors, I did not spend any resources on insurance and had more available to further the development and upgrading of the community. I learned that time is precious when you invest in protection, you do not have the time to invest in the development of the community. One has to choose carefully where the community needs the most support according to the needs, imediate and future Balancing the amount invested in insurance, development and protection was the trick to reach the fifth level of the game. Research also helped, but whenever the development was being accomplished, in accordance to time. Whenever the minimum time limit was on red, meaning development was not taking place as it should, barely any efforts were given to research, a  commonly found in real life as well.WHen I was in Level 5, I was doing very well with a fully functioning upgraded community, but realized to late the protection from the asterois and tidal waves had gone down after a few minor hits and  a highly damaging Asteroid came. I had been investing too much in development and forgot to insure a highly developed community. The damages were catastrophic and I had to spend all my resources in repairing the community.\n\n3.\tOne major change I would propose is to turn the theme of this game into a farming/rainfall insurance game.The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter where I live would not make much sense to me now. However, I do work with Africa a lot in wastewater treatment and reuse as fertigation for areas with lack of rain and groundwater. I would like to see a game like this in respect to the effect that rainfall insurance cause in India though. I am not entirely clear on how it works. The fact that farmers can pay the insurance when there are crops producing is understandable. However, if it does not rain, and the farmer does not have any product to sell, how could he have had afforded the insurance in the first place? Therefore, I would substitute the pods for crops and the asterois for droughts to see how this system is working.  Is it true that farmers only get their security insurance payments in case of no rain and he has produced no crops? "

Once this knowledge was obtained, the trade-off of elevating the land or continuing to build and expand the pod community could be made. This was also important because the advancement bar for the next level was halted during protection periods. Insurance was a necessity in my opinion. It allowed for the quick repair of the pod village which allowed for better advancement opportunities when more low-risk comets were approaching. The trade-off for the insurance was cost vs. protection coverage. Due to the short length of time for each stage of the game, I found risk preparation to have more of an immediate impact. I did find myself preparing less for potential comet impact during the last quarter of each stage in order to better increase my odds of filling my advancement meter. "

Making this initial choice immediately set the direction for how a player build pods. After initially trying to balance, I tried to rely on one path (research) which worked until a massive comet took me down in level 5. Had I spread out my risks, maybe I would have been better prepared for the large comet, but I am unsure about this.

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?

Having been given the hints of building and up-grading, I made the choice of continually improving the island.\n\nKnowing that a meteor could strike at any time, there was plenty of incentive to both insure the property and improve the height of the land.\n\nThere is always an initial balance between spending for development, accumulating wealth versus insuring the property. However, when a disaster strikes, without insurance, along with the devastation of property,  also included is financial ruin.\n\n\nIf you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?\n\nThe one thing I would do differently, would be to develop the property at a more accelerated rate.\n\nThe main points appeared to be to develop the property quickly and insure your property to the proper level.\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.

Achieving success in the game – meeting required levels of development – depended on identifying and assessing different potential risks and levels of threat, and making choices that resulted in an overall strategy for managing those risks effectively based on available resources. \n\nThere were inherent trade-offs between allocating scarce resources – which took the form of both time and money – to acquire either knowledge (which used up time spent on \"research\"), or \"protection\" (which cost money itself, but also used time as well as resulting in diminished income generation), or \"insurance\" (which cost different amounts of money based on the level of insurance purchased). It was also important to have enough money resources to allocate to \"development\" in order to meet overall objectives there within the given timeframe.\n\nIn addition, there were choices about how much to invest in each type of protection based on the precise threat encountered. Given that not all potential threats were realised, one needed to consider not just the size of the threat, but also in the potential for it to actually happen, as well as exactly when it might occur. As such, risk management choices paid off in different ways: \"protection\" mitigated damage against all threats in a general sense over time (but was relatively expensive), \"research\" increased capacity to deal with specific and immediate threats as they happened, and \"insurance\" offered a general way of dealing with the aftermath of a disaster.\n\nI played the game several times, and learned to manage risks better each time. At first I focused on purchasing as much \"protection\" and \"insurance\" as possible, but after the first attempts I realised that this strategy meant that I was often unable to prevent damage when a strike did occur, and I also had too few resources left over to invest and reach required levels of development. I therefore adapted my strategy by investing more in \"research\": this enabled me to prevent damage from occurring after a strike, lessening the need to spend as many resources on costly protection and insurance, and thus also freeing up some resources for development. \n\nIf I were tasked with developing a new version of the game I would adapt it to risks faced in my local context, where issues include health, risks around agricultural production, natural disasters (earthquakes and cyclones), long-term environmental degradation and broader issues of climate change. A more complex version of the game could also incorporate different patterns of development, for example through having different types of community, such as urban and rural, each producing different things and generating different levels of income; it could then also include different types of threats, each with varying consequences for different groups.\n"

I like how you related the volatility of the oil prices in your country to develop a trade-off model in your revision of the game. I think spreading the cost of the building the pods is a good idea practically, but I am not so sure about this in terms of wealth generation and community development, which the game was about. \n\n\nGood luck for the remainder of the course",

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game was three fold. It firstly involved the pursuit of opportunity. This was done in the form of building and upgrading the pods on the planet. Secondly, it involved preparing for risks by acquiring knowledge about the comets, purchasing insurance and increasing the level of protection. Lastly, it showed how to cope with the effects of risks by repairing the damaged pods and receiving the benefits of attaining knowledge, purchasing insurance and ensuring protection. It gives a great insight into the process of risk management and its components. And gives players practice in risk management. The challenge in this game was to attain a balance. This refers to the balance between knowledge, protection and insurance. The time constraint sometimes limited the amount of knowledge that could have been obtained and if sufficient knowledge was obtained, it limited the amount of time available to allocate resources sufficiently between insurance and protection. The budgetary constraint resulted in a trade-off between protection and the pursuit of opportunity by the upgrading and building of pods. However, by preparing for risk, the effects of the comets were significantly reduced which made coping with its effects easier. By increasing protection, the percentage of damage caused decreased and by purchasing insurance, the amount of money needed to repair the pods was lower.\nIf I do attempt to play the game again, I would spend more time and money upgrading and purchasing pods. I believe the amount of time I spent preparing for risk sometimes hindered my pursuit of opportunity. Seeing that pursuing opportunity and coping are the definition of risk management, my strategy faltered in that area.  However, many lessons were learnt from this game. Firstly, it is good to pursue opportunity as long as you are well prepared for the risks that may be faced. Also, in preparing for risks, there must be a good balance between knowledge (understanding the severity and possibility of the comet hitting), insurance (attaining help to cushion the damage done to the pods) and protection (raising the level of the ground to lessen the effect of the wave caused by the comets) in order to cope with the effects of the risks faced. Knowledge must be the first element to be obtained. After this is done, the decision to allocate resources (those resources being time and money) would be done more efficiently between protection and insurance.  \nIf I was given the task of changing one thing to this game, I would include a risk return trade off. That is, I would show that in order to achieve a high return, one makes themselves vulnerable to a higher level of risk. This is evident in many countries particularly through the financial system. In my country, Trinidad and Tobago, oil and gas is our major source of GDP. The oil and gas sector is a very volatile and risky sector given that oil and gas prices are volatile. However, it produces very large returns which provide the main source of income for my country. Therefore to add to this game, I would give the option of building conservative, moderate or aggressive pods. The conservative pods would be cheaper to build, give a very small return (very small increases to development bar) and cause less damaging comets to attack. Whereas, the aggressive pods would give a very large return (large increase to development bar), be more expensive to build and cause more damaging comets to attack. Conservative pods would lie in the middle. Thus, players will be more aware of the challenges faced in pursuing opportunity."

The game required a heightened\nsense of control and analysis, especially when it came to analysing the various\nrisks involved and how to manage them. The role of the game was to see how one\nwould analyse risk, evaluate and prioritise the protection and coping factors\ngiven in the game. It tested my limits to see how best I could evaluate and\nassess the risks I was faced with. The game involved some sort of\nstrategy to see how best one would implement the appropriate measures within the\ngiven time frame. After playing the first level, more knowledge was gained and\nemphasis was placed on the severity of the risks involved.  Trade-off's I made included not setting\nup all the pods, but rather trying to get the existing pods upgraded every\nchance I got. I realised upgrading was the key to success, also,\nnotwithstanding; obtaining the insurance and topping up the protection. The preparation\nfor risk immediately aided me financially to purchase/upgrade the pods and\nit also aided with the time constraint, and I soon realised that upgrading the infrastructure\nis what really got you ahead in terms of progress and development. I also\nrealised upgrading existing pods, was slightly more important than just setting\nup new pods in large numbers, and not upgrading them. I maintained medium to high protection at all times while choosing a suitable insurance package. I also concluded that after some time my risk\nanalysis skills improved due to practice. This would be due to the\nknowledge of the game after several levels. With knowledge and strategy, I was able to progress through the game. I realise the purpose of the\ngame was also to perform under time constraints, while assessing and dealing\nwith risk thrown at me. I ended up playing the game more than once; therefore I\nwas able to move faster with regard to networking the community when disaster\nstruck, also analysing the severity factor and prioritising how I dealt with threats.\nThe main thing I learnt from the game is coping, multi-tasking and effective risk\nanalysis while maintaining financial stability. If I were to add one thing to\nthis game, I would put in an option where there are other alternative contingency\nmeasures to mitigate the damage when hit. "

You had to choose between the trade-off of spending the money in building and improving the houses or in risk management (purchasing risk insurance, getting knowledge of the meteorites or getting prepared). However, once you have been playing for some time you realize that is not a real trade-off, because when you invest money in risk management, you develop faster and so you get more money to invest in improving the city. Moreover, when you prepare the city against the meteorites, it develops more intensively and you get more money. However, it does not get results at first, but when you have been preparing for a while. I guess the game works as in real life: when you prepare, the consequences of the impact are less or they do not exist, when you purchase insurance you get reinbursed for some of the losses so you do not have to pay for all the costs of the reconstruction and when you get knowledge of the problem you can prepare better or decrease the chances of an impact. "

During the game you learn how to prepare in face of a possible disaster and how to face the effects when the event occurs. What makes the experience unique is that in this process the game asks you to combine decisions in different but interconnected levels such as development, economic, knowledge, insurance and protection \n\nAs lesson learned, for example, in terms of protection you prove that it is important to make an effort to know the probability of occurrence of the event and also to measure the possible consequences. By doing this research it is possible to undertake protection measures that will reduce the impacts in case of a disaster.\n\nThe insurance is also pointed out during the game and shows that the more developments you have the more you have to pay for the insurance. This fact demonstrate that even is the cost of insurance is high it is a necessary action in order to avoid disasters affect the path to development. \n\nThe role of community is clear in the game because when a disaster occurs teamwork is key to reduce the impact in the society. \n\nSince I played the game only once what I would change if I play it again would be to be able to make more balanced decisions in terms of building new constructions and spending money in preparation. This because I think that may be I constructed new buildings too fast not always assuring its safety. \n\nFinally, I would only change a small thing about the game. My propose is to add a different kind of risk to the game so as you go truth the levels you have to take management decisions in a situation where you not only have to prepare and protect from a natural disaster because you also have to face with additional risk such as a financial crisis situation, or a technological disaster due to natural disaster such as in the case of Fukushima Disaster in Japan. \n\nI think this change  should be interesting since you can take more integral decisions in face of complex context that are more like the reality that we face in countries like Colombia. \n"

Also, it required a strategy, planning and implementing decisions so as to develop the village fully. In addition, risk management helps the community to grow while being cushioned against risks and if the risks occurred, then it would help in minimizing losses.  \nTo make a good decision, I had to consciously plan to monitor the environment, assess the risks and take corresponding action. After citing a comet, had to analyze possibility of occurrence and if it did occur, then what would the severity be. The speed at which I took actions to some extent contributed to whether I would be caught up and hit badly, lots of losses or I would be ready for any eventuality.\nI also noted having immediate savings helped me to minimize damage. In addition, formal insurance helped me to rebuild destroyed pods and at a cheaper cost. \nIt was necessary to balance all the aspects, as the severity in the comet increased, so did the damage if it hit the pods. As my risk increased, I also found it necessary to buy higher amount of insurance because savings alone would not help much.\n\nAs I prepared for risks, development slowed down but because I had to do research and also take protective actions. Later on it was easier to develop because I had taken necessary protection measures. I now had time and less worry about risks. This is because I was constantly aware of what eminent risk and potential losses and ways to mitigate as well as cope.\n\n2. Learning\nI learnt that it is important to carry out research constantly so that you can gauge the elements you are exposed to vis a vis potential damage in the event of occurrence and take the necessary decision on whether to protect or to insure. Saving was also important in reducing the damage. The higher the safer it is to, in addition to protection, transferring the risk through insurance. \n\n3.

My main protection against the meteors came from using the slider to raise my land. This way, even if a significant meteor came in, my city wouldn't be damaged. Using this approach to negate damage, I didn't have to invest a lot of money into insurance because there was minimal damage to my buildings. I raised the land to the minimum level needed for protection because I used all remaining money to build and upgrade my buildings. If I chose to prepare for risk before developing buildings, immediately after I wouldn't have as much money to use to upgrade the buildings. Over time, it paid off to invest in protection because it prevented me from spending more money on repairs and insurance."

Without\nconfronting the shocks in the form of comets, preparing for them by undertaking\nenough research protection and insurance within a protracted time frame,\ndevelopment of Alora became virtually impossible. I think the key here was\ndeveloping a balance between developing the community and preparing for these\nshocks.For example in situations where the severity of the shock was potentially\nhigh ( In the case of a fast moving comet with very high severity and potential\nfor hit) a tradeoff had to be made between research and protection as there was\nvery little time before a hit. As such as such a little research was made but\nvery high protection was undertaken to counteract the severity of the shock.\nInitially there was not enough money to generate or amp up enough protection in\nwhich case a little protection was generated, some insurance bought and a lot\nof research done in order to create community connections if and when potential\nshocks hit in order to avert or reduce the potential damage. Of note in situations  where the severity of the shock was very minimal to none much more\nresearch could be done as opposed to protection, Thus generating more income\nthat could be used in more development. Insurance was only bought only when and\nif the severity and chance of hit was very high. Thus freeing up more money for\ndevelopment. I guess the risk management undertaken in each circumstance would\nhave to be adapted to each individual shock.Thus underscoring the\nimportance of research.How one adapts to each individual shock also depends on\nthe amount of money available. I discovered that the more I played the game I\nbecame more adept at averting risk, the more risk I averted  the more money\nI had for more development. Overtime the more I developed and grew the\ncommunity more money was made such that there was more than enough money for\nmore and more development as well as enough to handle the potential shocks that\ncame with it.               \n                                                                                                                                                                              When playing the game\nthe second time it was more beneficial t upgrade already existing pods than to\nbuild more individual pods. Time was of the essence I had to balance the speed\nat which I upgraded and developed pods with research protection and insurance against\npotential shocks by making use of every little opportunity I had to increase\ndevelopment. What I learned from the game was in this delicate balancing act\nbetween research protection insurance and development, time and money were\npotential game changers. If managed well they would become very powerful tools\nin risk management and thus open up more opportunities for development. However\nevery little opportunity for development must be taken advantage of for any\nsubstantial development to take place.                                                                        Nigeria for example is a country blessed with abundant\nhuman and natural resources . Despite our country being declared the largest\neconomy in Africa worth $510bn over sixty percent of our population live in\nextreme poverty. We are consistently plagued with a myriad of problems such as\npoverty, inadequate healthcare, problems in education, youth unemployment, lack\nof adequate infrastructure and most recently terrorism. All due to inadequate risk management. So if I were to change\none thing about the game it would probably be confronting the risk of poverty\nthrough developments in agriculture, by researching, protecting and insuring\nagainst potential shocks such as climate change that threaten destabilize such initiatives. For development to take place a crucial balance must be maintained between managing risk and taking advantage off opportunity for development.                                                                                                              "

Part of the balance was about timing. For example, I found I had to stop the research for some time to give me a chance to build up on the pods once I realized that I had enough wealth or where based on the research, I was able to make a choice when to continue building on the protection.\n\nI played the game more than once. Each time I learnt more about how I was making my choices and how they were influencing the outcome. For example, I realized that giving more time to research added more value and enabled me to not only know what meteor might hit but also see when to spend more time building protection. I also realized that sometimes I neglected or did not consider purchasing insurance but found out difference it made when I did actually get hit.  Having paid for insurance meant I paid less to repair my pods and did not lose too much value on the pods.\n\nIn terms of a change that I would make; instead of the meteors hitting, I would have the lack of health care plans or health insurance as the possible hit. A good number of those living in my country Kenya do no have health insurance plans. This remains a major risk in the event that there is sudden illness and treatment has to be paid out of pocket. Often it eats into savings that was meant for other areas such as education, buying property or another investment. In a worse scenario, a good number do not have any savings in the first place. This often leaves many in debt or having to spend a good portion of time figuring how to raise the money to cover for treatment.  The reason most do not have a health insurance plan in the first place or are not able to save up for emergencies that would cover for illness, is situations where they do not have sufficient money (no extra money to spare for saving) or are not able to plan the little income or revenue they get to put aside a small amount or on the other hand have not considered or given priority to the possibility that illness could occur.\n"

If a comet did hit the ground,another goal was to learn how to cope with its effects by recovering from loss using the same elements. Some of the trade-offs I had to face were,for instance,giving up a higher insurance coverage in exchange for more protection and more resources to build new pods,or having to build less in order to be able to afford their insurances when they evolved since they became more expensive. Go as a consequence of these trade-offs,this led me to make some choices which had to do with reaching a balance between the deployment of knowledge,insurance and protection,thus making sure these elements were obstacles . Development was affected by preparation for risk in times when severe comets with high chance of hit come closer to the ground ,thus forcing me to spend great amounts of financial resources on preparation which did not allow me to achieve a continuos development. However,this was an effective decision since costs of preparation ended up being lower than costs of coping. After playing the game several times, I learned that the finest way to manage risk while encouraging development is by identifying the resources the resources you have and how they may help you to mitigate risk,making an even and moderate use of them,implementing development actions gradually but strongly,thinking strategically and learning from experience to become more resilient every time towards the effects of risk. In contrast to this game was to focus right straight into development without taking enough time to analyze how to manage preparation so that development would not be hindered. Finally, if I were to change  something about this game, I would add more types of risk,both idiosyncratic and systemic,such as crime,diseases,financial crisis,etc. The possibility of establishing different forms of institutions in order to overcome risk obstacles like banks,enterprises and hospitals. Multiplayer game mode so as to simulate different actors,private and public and their incentives. And behavioral obstacles such as overconfidence and short memory."

Matching the protection bars with the severity of the comets raised the land preventing damage to the pods and the accumulated research strengthen our protection by enabling us to create connections before the hitiing of the comet. Insurance was handy after the pods were damaged since they could be rebuilt cheaper and the develoment time lost could be recovered. The trade-offs were crucial because the available resources were limited and had to be allocated appropriately. I felt that effective allocation of resources was the key to creating a healthy community. Investing in only one tool would hinder development and pose a constraint to hollistic growth.

Without insurance I lost a lot of\ndevelopment and suffered a large amount of damage, which I was not able to\nrecover from. Like the example given in this week’s video lectures about better\nflood defence making floods less frequent and making residents less likely to\nprepare themselves for floods, I found myself preparing less for damage caused by\ncomets by not buying insurance and keeping less in the way of savings. This\nultimately resulted in a shock that I could not recover from in time. "

The first thing I made is to build pods and do protections them (upgrading, or use protection bar) as soon as possible to cope the comets threaten. When the comets appear, base on level of severity, and chance of hit I'll decide to make research more or less the levels. To prepare for risk of comets, gathering knowledge (research) is the most important, next is protection and insurance is last. Knowledge can tell you what you should do first, which is important and how you can do. For example, if severity or chance of hit is hight, or both of them, you have to do Protections rapidly first, at least same equal level with them, then make research the more the better. An advantage of this game is that you can research comets, upgrade the current pods and build more pod in same time. So, if you have money and time enough, try to do all the actions quickly. It helps your community has both protection and upgrading, this is the key of development of Alora. And if the threaten of comets is low you, maybe, just focus  on upgrading, building and protection. You only have a certain amount of money, so the funds for building, or upgrading, or protection must be considered, as long as the community has been expanded and protected. Some money could be reserved for repairing in the case you get damaged.\n\nI played game many times to reach level 5, a little bit unlucky to reach the highest level. Trying to build more and more, upgrading, buy insurance, use protection bar... but in the first plays I couldn't pass over level 3, until I found that Knowledge and Protection is the best ways for sustainable development. Insurance is the only safeguard in case of force majeure.  \n\nTo have a better represent in risk management in my country, it's important to change Cognitive and Biases of behavior. like other developing countries we have many obstacles in risk management to: lack of information, sources, finance... To have a better represent in risk management in my country, the important thing is to change Cognitive and Biases of behavior. For example, people used to open hot water 24/24, do not unplug power, run the washing machine with too few clothes, use the freezer temperature too low.. they think this is normal, so do not waste electricity much. But if other 80 million people thought so too, the power consumed is not a small number while the country still lack regular electricity. Another example the habit of using plastic bags. Since the advent of plastic bags it proved very good its usability. However, its impact on the environment and health are huge but almost none of us noticed. Plastic bags harm from production because the production of plastic bags to use as raw material in the oil and gas, and other additives are substances extremely hazardous to health and environment human. When released to the environment plastic bags break down into smaller molecules of plastic, toxic and eventually contaminate soil and water. According to a survey by environmental agencies, the use of plastic bags bluff seems difficult to quit the habit of Vietnam. As environmental sector, investment demand for environmental protection in Vietnam is 85.000 billion dongs. Of the above, there are hundreds of billions being used to overcome the damage caused by plastic containers, plastic bags of waste into the environment. So,changing in cognitive and behavior is simple and effective way.\n"

As the Lord Mayor of Alora island,\nthe player is requested to build up and upgrade as many pods as possible under\nthe strict conditions like the limitation of time and the various possibility\nand flooding effects of comet booming. The more convenient pods are, the more satisfaction\nof community is, but the more risky outcomes are as well. Despite the objective\nhazard, there are still three key ways to reduce the shocking outcomes of this\nnatural risk at different costs of resources. The simplest method, which costs\nno time, is to buy the insurance at three refund levels: 33%, 50% and 75% of repairing\nexpense, which means the damaged pods. Nonetheless, it charges a great amount\nof money depending on the community expansion. Another low-cost methodology is\nresearching the comet’s severity and possibility to predict the next step\nwhereas the cheapest way is informing community about the studying data of\nthese comet destructions to prepare and protect people. However, the two\nlow-priced ways cost much time, a precious resource during any sudden natural\ndisaster; therefore, the player has to save time and money and use resources\nwisely and effectively; or in other words, to balance among three powers: Research,\nProtection, and Insurance. In short, the game requires the player to\ncontinually establish and develop the pods to earn money and public\nsatisfaction but manage risk and prepare for the potential outcomes at the same\ntime."

But as it is said, you have to sacrifice something that you want for something that you want more, I too had to make choices. The protection, knowledge i.e research and insurance were the key choices which were to looked upon in order to mention overall development. I as the Illuminator of the planet tried to first go for protection in few initial seconds. Then as I would see the comet approaching I would do the research and based on the severity increase the research and otherwise would make and update pods. Also based on the severity and chance of hit of the comets, I would take the insurance which would help in reducing repair costs. Preparation for risk would affect development in the sense that if one would use protection, development would stop thus affecting it immediately, insurance and making of pods would exhaust the resources and affected development in a while."

Then I spent on buildings, and last (but not least...) on research. The best trade-off I could observe was that highest insurance brought less damage and lower costs of recovery.

For my risk and opportunity approach, I decided to build houses and use mitigation strategies at first. I bought\ninsurance when my research (the information presented on meteorites) informed\nme that the probability of a shock was likely to happen and that my mitigation\nwas not enough to protect the capital invested in the city. Clearly, I did not\nhave enough capital and time to do everything at once: build capacity, research\nabout the risk (meteorites), invest in mitigation, buy insurance, and cope with the shock. For\nexample, if I used a lot of my time and resources to research about each meteorite,\nI would not build the capital in the city. Similarly, if I used all my resources to mitigate and elevate the city (protection), I would not have sufficient money to develop it to\nacceptable standards. The trade-off is, therefore, key to successful outcomes\nin the game and in real life itself.

Prepare for possible disruptions requires consideration of the relationship between costs and potential benefits once the risk has materialized. \"(...) If the comet does not hit, then the opportunity cost is the time we spend on research to the development of our community. Each share will cost us precious resources!\" \n\nb). Insurances. Definitely cost measures that aim to ensure, soothe and make it affordable for retrieval tasks of the various negative effects it brings the risk.\n\n2) What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?\nR/ I would like a wider scope in the sense of raising the preparation for the \"risk management\". Be ready for risk, involves managing under uncertainty, part of the key is in the balanced coordination of viewed components (knowledge, protection and insurance). \n\nBe able to identify the potential impact of any risk, part of understand not only the degree of exposure to any perturbation (external factor), also part of being able to give a reading ability of endogenous conditions (internal factor), from this double look (outside vs inside) can generate possible causes of success in risk management and increase future capacity to recover from negative events, and synergies between effective protection and assurance.",

Resources have to be allocated to these needs accordingly. \n    The biggest challenge of this game is ensuring that rapid economic development is taking place while making adequate allocations for those measures which protects the subsequently created pods (infrastructure) from comets (natural disasters). Therefore sufficient allocation must be made for both ex-ante measures (protection by increasing the elevation of the settlement, insurance and research regarding the potential effects of a possible impact) and ex-post measures (coping) such as reconstruction of the pods damaged by the natural calamity. The need for the ex-ante measures is pressing as the threat from comets is perennial. Therefore procrastination with regard to these disaster management measures is suicidal. \n    The greater the economic development (read as number of pods), the greater will be the potential hit from a natural calamity. Therefore the policymaker (player) has to ensure a certain degree of proportionality between the expenditure on economic development and that pertaining to risk management.\n     In terms of choosing between the various options which are available with respect to risk management measures, I found insurance to be the most important one and, therefore, my first action in any level was to take the highest level of insurance possible. I found that the benefits of the same far outweighed the cost incurred in taking it as damage was certain at every level and the cost of rebuilding the pods would be the same as that incurred in the original reconstruction of the pods if insurance was not taken. Also the pattern of comet impacts was such that one was certain to happen at the very end of the level and this event’s impact would almost always be massive. Without insurance, it is very likely that one will have neither the resources nor the time to reconstruct all the pods and hit to the development bar, in this scenario, is a big one and one cannot make a recovery sufficient enough to make it to the next round given the paucity of time after it. \n     I would rank insurance, protection and knowledge in that order in my preferences in this game. In a real life scenario, I think knowledge would precede protection in terms of importance primarily because knowledge is protection when knowledge is defined in broader terms and helps find ways to protect oneself. I played the game multiple times and I found speed of action as something that needed improvement on my side and this is what I focused at each successive attempt. I also increased the amount of research I did as it was a neglected area in my initial attempts. I found that I did not need to panic at the sight of every comet. This helped me better focus on economic development. This tells me that knowledge about potential risks and calamities helps me to focus on my strengths better. \n     I thought the game was one dimensional in terms of the source of risk. I think adding at least one more potential disaster would balance the game better and more aligned to reality. The disaster I propose is earthquake. The trade-off could be in terms of the quality of building materials. The higher the cost of the building materials, the better it would be at withstanding the earthquake and even comet impacts."

It was in fact it was a challenging experience to learn how risk management is important for one’s healthy development through this game. The tutorial given for assistance helped to learn about the game more in deep. Being the luminator of Alora, my task of developing this community by meeting certain milestones in the ways was really hard and thought provoking.\nBefore considering ever building the pods we certainly need to ensure adequate measures like sufficient amount of cash is there with us. It was necessary throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time available to make sure this risk protection was limited.\nAlora falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.\nThe power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.\nBy undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage.\nPlaying the game for the first time you will certainly find it difficult to access the amount of risk involved and possible consequences of it you may have to face if hit by the unforeseen factors, But given a chance to play again you will certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damage based on previous experiences.\nMain things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different ways to manage risk etc.\nIf given a chance to develop a new version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups within the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each members with the group financially in times of need. They could also take up a group insurance policy to anticipate and manage their risk. They could discuss within the groups their past experiences of risk and share within their group\n"

In order to reduce the risk, we needed to maintain community growth, have knowledge of the disasters, and use insurance for the benefit of damages. Managing the uncertain events needs a mix of knowledge of the occurrence, stability of the economy and also securing the assets for the damages that can occur. \nI made choices of building the community at level one and securing it by use of research. This made the community stable and created awareness about the coming disaster. The community was saved several times due to this method. Insurance was not a useful tool but it needed protection and hence was necessary. The protection handle was not used in the first level but later on the need for it arose. Preparation of risk required additional costs that needed to be removed from the development funds. Hence there was a slowdown in the development of the community and the growth was slow. We needed to balance both growth and risk. \nI played the game twice. I increased the research of the new risks that were entering. The community was getting developed at a comparatively slower pace and hence the additional cost was spent on covering the risk through insurance and protection from the disaster. In addition to this, when the disaster approached, the community could help one another and divide the risk among them and the damage level was comparatively lower. Hence the balance between development and risk cost was very essential. \nThe key takeaways from this were the existence of insurance to cover up the damages, due to which the costs of repairing the community was lower than before. Insurance, knowledge and protection help in coping with the risks that are uncertain as always. These 3 tools can help a community, nation and the world to sustain for a longer period of time.\nThe newer version of the game would include a feature of dividing damage once the meteor hits the community. Once the meteor hits the community, it is hard to know what is happening and what the spots signify. One added feature could be help from outside communities which would also cost the community. This can be used during urgent and disaster times. Sometimes, the meteors crash at a high speed and with a higher disaster rate. So it is hard to ascertain or balance the effect of damage. In such cases, the help from other communities can be used."

I’m not a gamer and plus a concrete learner (hand-on, see by doing). Initially, my game focus was on the comets something I couldn’t control; and not on what I could… However, when I reviewed the comments regarding the game on the discussion forum, one student provided a screen shot of his Level 5 or 6. This helped me to see what the community of Pods could looked like. I finally reached Level 5 after, what seemed like 100 restarts (from the beginning) or more. I enjoyed reading your paper.

In order to reduce the risk, we needed to maintain community growth, have knowledge of the disasters, and use insurance for the benefit of damages. Managing the uncertain events needs a mix of knowledge of the occurrence, stability of the economy and also securing the assets for the damages that can occur. \nI made choices of building the community at level one and securing it by use of research. This made the community stable and created awareness about the coming disaster. The community was saved several times due to this method. Insurance was not a useful tool but it needed protection and hence was necessary. The protection handle was not used in the first level but later on the need for it arose. Preparation of risk required additional costs that needed to be removed from the development funds. Hence there was a slowdown in the development of the community and the growth was slow. We needed to balance both growth and risk. \nI played the game twice. I increased the research of the new risks that were entering. The community was getting developed at a comparatively slower pace and hence the additional cost was spent on covering the risk through insurance and protection from the disaster. In addition to this, when the disaster approached, the community could help one another and divide the risk among them and the damage level was comparatively lower. Hence the balance between development and risk cost was very essential. \nThe key takeaways from this were the existence of insurance to cover up the damages, due to which the costs of repairing the community was lower than before. Insurance, knowledge and protection help in coping with the risks that are uncertain as always. These 3 tools can help a community, nation and the world to sustain for a longer period of time.\nThe newer version of the game would include a feature of dividing damage once the meteor hits the community. Once the meteor hits the community, it is hard to know what is happening and what the spots signify. One added feature could be help from outside communities which would also cost the community. This can be used during urgent and disaster times. Sometimes, the meteors crash at a high speed and with a higher disaster rate. So it is hard to ascertain or balance the effect of damage. In such cases, the help from other communities can be used. \n"

            "reflection": "The role of risk management in the game was very\nhuge. There were many obstacles in achieving the goal at each level. Comets\nwere the destructing element in the game. Escaping from such destruction was an\nimportant task in the game. Basically, the game aimed in protecting the pods,\nwhich are the households. Risk management helps in protecting the pods from\nbeing destructed by comets. At the same time it is necessary to make sure that\nthe currency also does not come down and ensure that the meter is in green\ncolor. Firstly, in the first level, i created 4 pods. As the pods were created, i started upgrading each pod. So as to develop the area. And also i made sure that protection is given to the pods. Protection given to the pods depends on the severity and chances of hits. If the severity and chances of hit is more, then the protection should also be increased to match it. But the challenge is that as the protection increases the meter turns to red and yellow. Also, the currency reduces as the protection increases. Insurance is also provided as three packages in different rates that is 25%, 50%,and 75%. We can choose whichever package we want. Insurance to be selected also depends on the currency the player is holding. The rates of package also depends on percent of losses covered. Depending on the currency held by the player the package can be selected and to that extent the currency gets reduced. The pods can be upgraded alternatively. Up gradation also requires currency. If the money required is there, then the pods can be upgraded. the main thing to be noted is that, if the comets hit the pods, it should be immediately recovered. All of these steps are to undertaken within the stipulated time. And within this time, the meter should turn to green, which means favorable. Also only if this is achieved, that level is won and one can move to next level. Managing all these tasks at the same time is the real challenge faced by the player. The player should see to that, the currency is increased, the pods are protected and the meter to be turned to green color. In order to manage this risk i tried upgrading the pods as soon as possible, so that it earns currency, also the meter also changes its color. Definitely, i played the game more than once. The next time when i started playing, i made sure first the protection is increased to the level of severity and chances of hit. Then, also I kept on upgrading the pods continuously. By playing this game, I learnt that as the game progresses, the risk also increases. Likewise, to develop and to protect a community, it is important to manage different aspects. As there is more development, the risk involved also increases. Therefore, timely protection and insurance to be given when required. Also, we should be able to recover when we incur losses. proper attention is required to complete this task. Dedication towards accomplishment of the level is also much more important in this game. According to me, this game is constructed correctly. But given a chance, I suggest that may be the pods size can be increased or the plot could be increased so that many pods can be built. Also up gradation of many pods at a time takes longer time. It can be made faster. A guard can be made available to protect the pods. But not for all the pods, only one pod with time limit. "

It was necessary throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time available to make sure this risk protection was limited.\nAlora falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.\nThe power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it.

After many faults, I realized that I had to change to adapt with\ncurrent situation, I started to concerned and researched on comets such as severity,\nchance of hits and predict time of collision to had a wise choice among\nmethods. In higher level, the game went harder, concentration was must have due\nto complicated development and the choice of method should be exact. For\nexample, I might apply “Insurance method” to buy insurance at medium cost for\nmy pods if did not have enough time to prepare and upgrade my village land to\nhigher level. In short, the lesson learned is we should have deep consideration\nbefore choosing any methods such as copping, knowledge, insurance as well as\nprotection and apply it flexibly."

The game covers the concept of risk management in all the levels, thereby giving me an ultimate experience of different stages of risks and their after-effects. A strategy game that instructs within itself the challenges that could be symbolically related to the instances in our daily life. \nBeing the Luminator of Alora, the task given was to develop the community by predicting risks and to make sure that there is advancement in the society. It was a very challenging game as it enables us to take decisions and take the right amount of risks by researching on them. By building pods, the rate of development would increase and thereby making the environment much safer.\nIt was important to note that there should be a sense of balance throughout as we had to check for few constraints before we could develop and safeguard the land. This aspect taught me the significance of accountability that we possess in our lives to take care of the environment we live in and also to take considerable amount of risks on an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the community to bear the shocks but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It is indeed really important to research on the risks that come our way and eventually develop on a protection plan to minimize the damages from it. Insurance is also a key element in the game, as it ensures and safeguards the land from major damage. It will be cheaper and quicker to rebuild the pods after damage. Striking a balance between them all and performing each action with utmost care was indeed a very challenging task. \nWhile playing the game, it was also important to do proper time management as we had a time constraint in developing the land of Alora and also to protect them from the waves caused by the meteors. So within the specified time, good research, protection, development and insurance against the damages were to be done in the best possible way. Good research was mandatory as it educated us with the performance and the severity of the meteors and how it could affect the environment. Preparation of risks also helped in money management. Building the right number of pods with the given budget and also to insure them was a decision that we had to take after much reflection and thought.\n By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage. \nIf I were to develop a new version of the game, I would have made it comparatively more realistic by introducing real life situations of protecting a city or environment and have obstacles and risks in relation to the real-life scenarios. I would have also introduced few other concepts in which the players could make some money as they deal with damages. \n"

I confronted multiple trade-offs against the development of the community as represented by the development bar, through constraints in both time and money, which had to be spent for preparing against shocks on research, protection and insurance. These measures slowed down the rate of development of the community, but have been instrumental in coping with shocks in a very efficient manner. "

Insurance can also be used for recovering after a disaster, but financing the costs of this tool should be kept in mind.

A trade off was necessary between knowledge , protection and insurance  Before taking actions and spending money on them , we need to first decide the proper measure between knowledge protection and insurance to save our island alora from the comets attacking our island . i confronted with the problem of resources which are scarce in existence like we have to decide that how we have to spend on insurance so as to protect ourselves from the fallling comets and on protection which costs one dollar for 1 % and we needed enough protection so that it matches with the severity of the comets so that no damage happens to our pods .At the same time , we also need to see that in the face of building resilience , we also need to focus on development of the island by building it costing 200$ and then upgrading it from time to time which costs 295$ ,422$ etc.And all this we have to manage within a short span of given time so time is also an important factor for managing risks .\nI have played this several times to understand its concept. After playing for the first time , i get to know how to protect my island from comets in a more organized way  than before .At the first instance , I didn't understand how to confront all of things together i.e. research, protection and insurance for development.But after playing again, things became clearer.Each pod that i built helped to increase my development level.I got to know that by obtaining insurance , pods damaged from flooding will be quicker and easy to rebuild .Moreover insurance also recovers lost development time after the pods are repaired .Therefore, in a similar way, we will expertise in the field of managing risks if we do it consistently like in  this game we did.This game taught us that by using these three weapons in concert with development we can create a healthy community. The only way to succeed is to find the perfect balance at the cost of our precious resources.Hence risk management is a powerful tool for development.\nThe one thing that I would like to add is the number of risks in this game to make it more challenging and involving.Like other than the flood , other risks such as earthquake and other epidemics can be introduced which we face in our daily lives and more insurance schemes can be introduced to increase the awareness of insurance. The place where i live is a place which is trapped in droughts.So people over here has got no incentive to  take risks and undertake a new project because of lack of water.So insurance an be provided from the loss arising out of the epidemic.\nHence I can say that risks are a concomitant of change and opportunity.\n"

In particular, it seems you have come to understand the importance in striking a balance among investments for protection, insurance and research. Not clear whether you played the game more than one or not. However, some of your final reflections might need to be informed by more evidence. When you say that research added small value to your effort (presumably based on a few games), your conclusion seems to be in contract with what both specialized literature and the course  content itself seem to suggest. Likewise, your suggestion to borrow money from other altruistic countries seem to be a bit oblivious of the ongoing global reality where competition for development funding has become quite fierce. Also, looking for external funding might also introduce some more variables of risks and dependence in the medium- and long-term. Therefore, what I suggest is to make the limitations (if you see any) of your conclusions more explicit when presenting your arguments. Once again, thanks for your ideas and contributions. Good luck with your final project and the successful completion of this course!",

From the game beginning it's too boring for education game, at the same time i could read something about Risk management and get more useful information. Anyway i should make report about this game. Cerainly, main role in this game assigned for risk management (because it is main theme of our course). In the world of Alora you are obviously King and should decide sharing of resources between three things - exploring of comets, using protection slider and using insurance (i ve bought twice insurance, and in both times it hasn't helped me). Player getting resources for building and upgrading pods, but when pod on upgrade - it doesnt give money and we should have, in my honest opinion, 5 pods and try to upgrade it as fast as we can, but dont forget about main objective of this game and spend resources to get no damage for our pods. I ve made very simple sharing of resources, because insurance didnt make a sense for me. I held medium level on protections slider and maximum exploring of comets to get more time if comet ll not miss. Risk management doesnt interfare in game beginning, because almost all comets in the game beginning miss. Then your game depends of your strategy with pods. I mean decision to make a lot of 1 lvl pods, or 4-5 pods and upgrading it. Second strategy are more success. Anyway you starting to feel risk management since 3-4 level, because on Alora falls too many comets and you can't explore them all just because of the time it will take. The main thing I learned from this game - insurance doesnt work, spending fo resources. I played about 3 - 4 times. The main thing i changed in every next game - pods building strategy. My first time decision to rush all island with 1 level pods and then start to upgrade it led me to fiasco. Its funny simple model of risk management, but i get bored of playing it 4-5 times, when one of aspect doesn't work. But at the same time pretty nice that my game on fourth level depends of my decisions on the first. If i get task to develop game, i would allow independent exploring of comets to be possible make another comet exploring, because watching for 30 seconds on comet when in few seconds you ll got 5 hits can stop you, if i have enough resources i want explore all of falling comets. I live in Russia and its very hard to say, seriously. Sorry for my English knowledge, it probably make you cry."

Then, in providing feedbacks based on my observation;\n1.\tStrengths:\n•\tYour reflection is clear to understand\n•\tIt is very good that you understand the central idea of the game as you stated that it is important to make balance actions between (community) development and preparation for risk on the one hand and balancing the use of different risk preparation powers/strategies – research/knowledge, protection and insurance on the other.\n•\tIt is very interesting that you have suggested the consideration of the role of self-help groups as risk managers in the construction of the new version of the game. I think it is very insightful propose the risk management process of self-help groups reflected in a game so that it would be supportive in exercising risk management in a real world from the perspective of self-help groups. I appreciate a game incorporating the concept of self-help groups in risk management game because self-help groups within the community are immediate and the most nearby actors to be affected by shocks at the same time, as they are immediate actors to manage the risk of shocks given that their capacity is enhanced. Thanks for this idea. \n2.\tWeaknesses:\n•\tRegarding the 2nd question, it seems that you stated the challenges you faced in terms of technical mastering of running the game. Rather it would have been better to state in terms of the conceptual challenges you faced or what conceptual mistakes you made in the first playregarding risk management preparation or in applying the three powers for risk preparation; then what did you learn from your first play and then what conceptual changes  (for example in balancing between research, protection and insurance) you made in the second play to achieve better risk management. Regarding the lessons you have learnt from the game, while you have indicated that you have learned about different strategies and measures, you did not show that what strategies and measures should be used and how \n•\tRegarding the 3rd question, while it is innovative to suggest to represent self-help group risk management within community, I think you failed to show how the self-help group risk management could be played as a game and how different concepts and/or strategies of self-help groups’ risk management could be represented or incorporated in the game. Again, you failed to show how your suggestion matter in the place you live. \n\tIn summary, I suggest that when you are given assignment like this game, it is important to ask first what goal is planned to be achieved or what information is planned to be conveyed in the course under study. That means what knowledge can be obtained from doing the assignment that can be applied in any other related context than in specific context like in context of avoiding the risk of hitting comet in the game.  \n\nWish you all the best! \n",

Development and risk were hand-to-hand, sacrifice was definitely\nnecessary and you had to learn from your mistakes and more importantly make use\nof them for your future decision-making process. I always prioritized insurance\nafter getting hurt by the shocks during my first trial. As for protection and\nknowledge, I tried to keep them balanced and parallel with the severity of the\nshock but when I had the time, I always filled the research bar to the end. I\ndid take risks by disregarding several of the relatively minor in severity but\nvery fast-coming shocks when there was a bigger one following it at a slower\npace. I should say it worked out well for me each and every time. In addition,\nwhile managing risk I always tried to develop the community as much as I could,\nstarting out slowly but growing faster as I had the money and when the\nenvironment was shock-free.  However, I\nalways kept enough money so that I would recover fast if my insurance failed to\ncover the loss completely. The interesting thing was that at times when I was\nnot 100% ready for the shock, the coping between the community members\nminimized the damage done. Had I not played the game, I would have underestimated\nthe power of interconnectedness and risk sharing. Also mentioned above, after\nmy first trial I’ve come to realize the effectiveness of having insurance and\nbought the 75% option every other time, and tried to maximize research as much\nas possible."

As you encounter many obstacles along the way, the game allows you to reflect and try different strategies to overcome them. It is particularly this repeated obstacle-reflection-strategy triangle that helps you to learn by playing.\nTaking all this into account and looking at the questions that were given as a guideline for writing the short assignment, the main shortcoming of your essay is that it is missing the 'reflection' part that is the goal result of learning, application, and insight.\nWhatever your motivation for studying this course, do not despair - take your hard-earned factual knowledge and learn to apply it, reflect on the struggles, learn from them, and have another go.

In terms of making choices, after the creation of the community, the next step was to buy an insurance policy although, the system was programmed in a way that one has to buy insurance at every level/stage. After buying the insurance it is also necessary to invest on security and simultaneously make researches to have knowledge of the incoming threat ,to know the level of severity of the disaster on the community, and also to know the possibility of the crises. In doing this, it is sometimes good to trade-off Insurance for knowledge and protection but it is of opinion that more concentration should be on the knowledge as to know the level of severity. Meanwhile the preparation of risk management affect development of the community through a collective effort of the people in the community immediately and after the disaster. The community involvement is one factor that a society could leverage on for development after a disaster had occurred in order for people to be able to cope immediately and after a disaster."

Cooperation between houses was a great ally to in order to recover from damages caused by the comets - this showed how the community must be engaged in order to help to recover the losses and get back on track. Another interesting point was that of growth opportunity: I had to know the right timing to protect the village from the commets, build new houses and invest for improvement of the already built houses. Also if a house was hit or damaged by a commet, I had to know and use my resources in order to repair it in due time. So, many tough decisions were made in a small time spin."

Other option is to buy\nan insurance so if there is a hit the repairs will cost less.

You must keep some\nmoney for repairs of your building too. The main thing that I learned from this\ngame is that there must be balance between development and risk management.\nWhen I was playing the game for the second time I bought an insurance (the\nfirst time I wasn’t) and also I was paying more attention to the meteors by\nobserving them (it was good to know if the possibility for hit is high or low\nand it also gives me the opportunity to made more connections just before the\nhit). If I have to develop a new version of the game I will add the possibility\nof buying an anti-meteor rockets so that you can have one more options for\nprotection. This week in my country – Bulgaria – here in the capital city –\nSofia was a terrific hailstorm which caused damage for nearly 60 million only\nfor the insured vehicles (there are other casualties including the life of one\nman).

The\ngame very interestingly combined the different aspects of risk management i.e.\nResearch and Knowledge, Protection and Insurance in order to help understand\nthe concepts even better. It is very much a simulation of a real world situation\nwhere the risk is that comets will hit the ocean and destroy the city. So the\ncitizens need to plan and prepare for the risk, protect themselves before the\nsituation strikes and make sure that they are financially able to cope up with\nthe losses if such a situation comes up. There is some amount of wealth\nallocated for development of the city which is directly a factor of time; hence\nthe more time we have the more wealth is generated to be spent for the city’s\ndevelopment. Also, in order to protect the city from the waves, the city\nplatform can be raised up to certain height, however this requires resources. There\nis a research lab which investigates the probability and severity with which a\ncomet can hit the waters. However since the research takes time, a decision\nneeds to be made if by we need to protect the city by investing our resources\nin raising the city platform or by buying insurance. So, a lot of trade off had\nto be made into making this decision. For example, a low severity and low probability\nevent could be mitigated by raising the platform but for a high severity and\nhigh probability event, a combination of buying insurance and raising the\nplatform will be a more effective strategy in terms of utilization of minimum\nresources. But the preparation of risk management did come at a cost, i.e.\ndevelopment was stalled because the resource i.e. both time and money had to be\ndiverted towards it. But the cost benefit of investing in managing the risks proved\nto be of immense value."

Maybe if you are a former gamer or have experience in strategy games, the time would not be a problem because of, along the time, you develop and upgrade pods faster, and thus you have more time to research the comets. \n\nAt the beginning, I had as priority getting the full insurance package and develop just a few pods, but I spent more time rebuilding than upgrading the pods. Then, I change my strategy and I built all the pods in order to obtain more money and invest in higher levels of protection. In consequence, I can\npass until de third level, where I was hit by a powerful comet just before time was over, so I can’t rebuild and reach the development level required to keep me in the competition. \n\nAs unfortunate fact, I have to say that, afterward I review peer’s advises\nin the forum, I play again, but my internet connection fail the entire weekend. So, I can accomplish my goal at the time of getting this reflection done. Thus, I only can suppose that the best strategy is build all the pods, get the minimum package of\ninsurance, and keep the protection at least to the fifth level. Furthermore, it’s very important focus on the comets with high severity and change-of-hitting levels; because the time you spend on repairing is a lot, especially when you have all the pods\nbuilt. From my experience with the game, I may suggest add more information to allow the gamer evaluate what is the more cost-effective option. For instance, I like to know how much I receive from each pod’s level, in order to decide upgrade the pods,\nget a better insurance package or improve my protection. As well the real challenges that actually face policy makers, information allows them obtain better result with a short experience curve. Right now, I work for a the planning office of the national\npublic institution for health sector surveillance, where we focus on getting the right information that allows us take the best decisions in order to protect the life of our citizens."

The growth goals for the levels are quite hard to meet and trying to go completely safe by getting a good insurance, building up a lot of protection and researching all of the larger impact threats is futile. The Strategy I adopted was to expand housing as fast as possible while keeping some money ready to buy insurance. I checked all threads as they appeared and ignored low impact ones. at the first really high impact threat I would buy insurance and if the probability of impact is high try to research it to the highest level to allow for good last minute preparation. Due to the high growth rates required it was hardly possible to build up much protection. Here I would only invest, after the growth goal for a level had been reached or if an extinction threat of the highest level approached and It was already completely researched."
