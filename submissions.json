Personally I found some of the richest strategies are:\n1.-keep your network healthy:  A healthy network is recognized way to find support in high risk environments and keep you without damage. Individuals cannot act alone. It is compulsive  concerted support and action from surrounding social and economic systems. The build of this network cannot be realized  without strong institutions and policies that focus on the long run.\n2 Knowledge and Continuous research helps: as the meteor goes down, and with several metheors and allows to distinguish between different risk levels\n3.- When the hit occurs, management activities or risk coping thanks to the insurance network.\n4 Knowledge allows prioritization: allows to Identify the types of obstacles that often impair risk management and prioritize.\n5 Recognize actions and reforms that can improve risk management and reduce the obstacles to it.\n\nFailing to follow simple preventive measures like take care when a hit is going to happend, to difficulties in mobilizing the  community to engage effectively in fragile states\u2014  are obstacles and constraints that stand in the way of responsible and effective risk management.\n\nI often underutilize this knowledge: significant progress in risk analysis, from better forecasting to more experience and knowledge about what happens when a hit occur retrofeed my actitude to new events.\n\nIf you don't have the rightincentives,the rightinformation, or if you have behavioral issues,then it might be useless or even counterproductive to justlook atthe resource only. And that'swhy in this series of assessments ofthe obstacles, we suggest that the assessment ofthe resource issues arrives last.\n\nUncertainty is a fundamental issue with risk management, and it needs to be confronted and accepted and dealt with, not disregarded, even\nthough it might be a difficult thing to do.\n\nPolicy action: two principles to keep in mind when designing risk management strategies. \nThe first one isto be realistic, and in cases where some simple solutions can work, even though these solutions might not be the optimal ones, maybe simplicity issomething that we should follow. That is especially the case in low capacity and low\u2010income governments where very sophisticated policies or tools might be very difficultto implement and practice.\nThe second principle isto build foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficultto design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will\nreact and how the contextwill change.\nImplement basic policiest hat focus on what's most important, like setting  the right incentives for people to manage the risk well or making the information available, and to make sure the policies are revised overtime regularly to correct, overtime, when more information is available or when we observe that some policies might have some negative side consequences.\n\nThe impact ofthese shocks can be amplified orreduced depending on people's external environment,their internal conditions, and whatrisk management is in place. There can also be important feedback effects overtime. So,for example,the outcomes of pastshocks may affect the propensity for future shocks. I'll use an example to help illustrate some of these concepts.\n\nI think this  game is useful, particularly in how it shows how risk management can be central to the transmission of shocks and the impact that they have. The question then is: Is thaht way how does effective risk management look like?\n\nEffective risk management needs to combine capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards. \nPreparation includes knowledge, getting information on risk, but then using that information to make judgments, obtaining protection,\nmeasures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, or obtaining insurance, measures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times."}, "47": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "This game is about\nfinding the right balance between spending resources on development and\nspending resources to protect the development using risk management tools\nprovided on the game.

I realized that for sustainable development to take place in my game community, I needed a good knowledge of all factors that may have a positive as well as a negative impact on my objective. The falling comets had the potential to negatively affect the development of my game community. After identifying the comets as a threat and assessing the probability of impact as well as the severity, I was able to make good decisions as to which comets had to be given priority. I had to take adequate measures to protect my game community by raising the land well above sea level. This measure costs me money, which I could have used for further development, but I also realized that it\u2019s a lot cheaper to be proactive and put in place adequate protective measures than it is to be reactive to the occurrence of an event (comet impact). I also realized that taking out an insurance policy on my community development actually made it more resilient in that I had to pay a lot less in the event of a risk occurrence(impact) and recovery was a lot quicker.\n\nAfter playing the game a couple of times, I had to learn to keep my eyes on the Big Picture and took a broad view of my community while still carrying out all my grass root developments. I had to ensure I wasn\u2019t too carried away by building and upgrading Pods and not looking out for the falling comets (Risks).\nIf I had the chance to make a change or add a feature to the game, I\u2019ll put in the option of added risk protection measures with their associated effectiveness and costs.

The risk management was important to improve and make a better\ngrowth of the community. It was about evaluating the risk of the every asteroid\nfalling down and make some decisions regarding the actions to do to reduce the\ndamage. In this case as in life and commerce in general, the damage was not\nonly the physical damage to the buildings but the economical damage to the\ncommunity in general. Personally, when I managed to pass the level, I put a lot\nof efforts and resources in insurance and protection whilst the knowledge was\nless important to me since the alley (or the unfortunate event in general) can\nhappen at any time and the community must be ready for it, no matter the\nknowledge of the asteroids scenario \u00a0In\nfact at the beginning I was a bit to confident I could make it with a low\nprotection level. After some time I realized it was too dangerous and I had to\ntake some measures to cope with risk and damages. Having played the games a few\ntimes, I increased progressively the level of insurance and the protection, spending\nless in growth and much less in knowledge. The result was a slower but safer\nand more robust growth that could keep going for so much time. In general I\nhave learned from the game that the very first thing to do is to learn the\nrisk, the damage and the severity and the probability. It is important to know\nwhat we are facing, what we can do and what we cannot do, the protection we can\nadopt and the insurances available that can protect us and our interests. The\nsecond step is to assess the balance between the amount of money that is spent\non growth (or on investments in general) and the resources spent on safety and\nprotection. This ratio increases with the severity of the damage and the probability\nof the event. Sometimes the risk must be faced with a great investment in\nsafety, almost the same amount for the growth itself. This is the case of disaster\nwith huge impact (nuclear reactors, Wall Street servers and so on\u2026) where we\ncannot allow any kind of doubt or possibility that a disaster might happen. If\nI were asked to develop a new version of the game and to update one thing, I would\npropose to create another kind of damage that no one can take control of. In\nlife, there are always a few things that are out of control and, no matter how\nprudent we are, they hit our life in such a way we cannot defend ourselves. In\ngeneral, this game does not foresee this kind of danger, but every business\nfaces unknown events or threats, be it a financial, structural or liquidity danger,\nthe resignation of an employee or any kind of threat we cannot defend ourselves\nagainst. In the game, even if the damage could be so hard, the probability high\nand the event frequent enough, there was always a way out of it, increasing the\nprotection and the insurance. It would be interesting to figure out a way to\ndepict a different and maybe harder scenario where some unknown events might occur\nfrom time to time and there is no knowledge, prevention and insurance against\nthem. The only way out of it might be saving some resources to start over again\nand differentiate the investments and resources.\u00a0"}, "96": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "2", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "I must confess that I didn't really understand what was happening in my attempts to play the Risk Horizon game. \u00a0However, I did learn pretty quickly that doing nothing got you nowhere. \u00a0(My first 'play' consisted of observation as I didn't know what 'the rules' were). \u00a0 \u00a0My subsequent attempts were played by engaging in constant activity - pressing as many buttons, sliders, comets as I could. \u00a0 The tutorial did not offer much assistance in knowing how to play the game. \u00a0After a number of attempts, I achieved Level 2 but without insight to the overall dynamics. \u00a0 I did not continue playing but note from comments in the forum that I was probably over-insuring. \u00a0It seems I had not mastered control in manipulating protection level either."}, "97": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "The conceptual understanding was immensely an eye widener, the person has learned a lot not only from the game but also from the course.\nThe hidden message behind the game was clearly understood.\nThe video attachment could have been used for the final projet but it is an honor for students like us to have viewed it while evaluating.", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The role of risk management in this game was evaluating and eventually choosing to which extent I should protect the recently created village against comets (natural disasters).\u00a0"}, "98": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "The reflection clearly showed that the student understood and connected the concepts of risk management with the game.

And doing all this while the main resource - TIME - is running out quickly !!\nAt first try i started to build only part of the island, because i was afraid of the risk from incoming comets and the damage they will cause. Then i understood the importance of community connections ans restarted to build with all the available money (hoping that if i run out of money i will be able to lend money from the World Bank). Then i protected the island from the invadind comets while studying the comets for better protection in the future (knowledge is power).\nThe role of risk management in the game was to balance between all the available resources: Money to build the island, research of the comets that threaten to destroy or damage what has been built, protection of the buildings and finaly buying insurance that will reduce the cost of damage because protection is never 100%. And all that with time running out quickly.\nTo prepare for good risk management you have to research and study the risks. Preparation for risk affect development  because this takes time, money and efforts - on the cost of developing the project. So one change i would propose to better represent the risk management choices in an improved game is that the comet research phase will run in parallel to the development, because in reality the research group of people is not the same as the building group and they can run in parallel time (not  in parallel money).

When it comes to the development of the community (in the game) I believe that balancing the insurance, upgrades of buildings and protection is really important, because once you get out of hands and just started focusing for example on upgrading the buildings; you can risk money, time and the development process for when a meteor comes with a strong severity when it comes in contact with your community, you will lose. So it balancing is really important to risk management, I conclude.\n(2) So basically what I learned from the game is that when it comes to community development in relation to risk management it is important that: a. I balance everything, b. Be more alert for unexpected and expected events that will come; c. Strategic planning is a must when it comes to risk management. I believe these three things that I have stated is vital in not only for the game but also for the real world when it comes to risk management. I also learned that when it comes to risk management sacrificing things is a must whether it's money, buildings etc. Sometimes sacrificing is a good thing for the development in the long run in the community. So when it comes to risk management, I believe you also have to be prepared to sacrifice things, but you should be careful and think critically on those things; will it benefit the community for the long run, or short run? or will it really benefit the community at all? \n(3) Probably if I had the opportunity to make a new version of the game that I played, I would add some agricultural businesses, health establishments and natural disaster events (floods, drought, earthquake and typhoons). I believe this new version of the game with the things I mentioned would probably be a more realistic version of our contemporary society, which can help us be more strategic and critical when it comes to risk management and developing the virtual community in the game; and the outcomes and strategies we can learn from the game, I believe, will also help us apply the things we learned in the real world."}, "120": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "Good job.

Risk management was mostly centered on preventing the infrastructure from being ruined or halted from its development and dealing with the after effects of the meteors. When it came to money i was divided between construction of new buildings, improving old ones, buying insurance or some other means of risk prevention. Development was affected both in the long run and the short run, being limited to continuing on a project, fixing an old one, upgrading or starting again. Risk preparation was a limiter to continuing the project but also one that helped it continue after a meteor strike. The times I repeated the game, I built less buildings and focused mostly on research of the meteors, buying insurance and other measures to prevent a large impact on the project. Also the few buildings I made I continued to improve and upgrade them until I had enough money to build smaller and cheaper new ones. As for Risk Management in general it is a constant and never ending process, even after a project is finished. Being constantly ready to notice a possible event that will hinder the place where the project is moving forward. Not only that the stress this causes is considerable which also means that any risk manager must have a clear mind, iron will and sound judgement. It was interesting how the time researching took from the time to build and improve, even when some buildings where already finished. Which I think makes an important point on how to manage ones time when managing risk. The brings me to my second point, the tactics one chooses to create their risk management \u00a0strategy does not have to have a lot of elements in it, just a few right ones will do.

I would leave the same geographical location for constructing the infrastructure, also I would limit the amount of measures that can be taken after increasing the different things that can be done to prevent a catastrophe. I would expande the research tool to be used on varios factors in the game, in order to make decision making much more challenging and resource managing even \u00a0more so. Probably the thing that I would like to add but find difficult, would be human interaction as a form of risk management, like a lawsuit, an accident or shareholder disagreements. A bit complex but those are factors that arise when taking on a task, people as a a source of risk. Not to be negative but it is a real life dilema and learning how to deal with it is something that is not taught in most schools.

While I was able to complete the levels without too much concern, I was also unsure of what events necessarily improved or reduced my ability to fill the green bar by the time the clock expired.  My strategy was mainly to build up my city as quickly as possible, maximizing my stream of income, and consistently holding my \u2018protection bar\u2019 above the damage level from the average comet.  For more dangerous comets, I attempted to maximize the time available to send communication through my city.  Even for comets with little risk, I researched two to three bars to minimize the risk as much as possible.  As I was never presented with greater than three comets at a time, it was advantageous to select either the quickest moving, or most dangerous comet for initial research.  There was always sufficient time to gain knowledge, and my protection was sufficient to avoid damage.\n\nIf I were to play the game again (which likely occur after this paper is submitted), I want to test if having a smaller, more advanced city proves superior to a city which contains the maximum number of buildings, but few of which are fully upgraded.  I assume this limits the \u2018communication\u2019 aspect, making it easier to improve my \u2018protection\u2019 statistic.  Less buildings should mean quicker communication, and also less financial burden if a comet were to damage my city.  I found it interesting that I never needed to purchase insurance through the five levels I played (I received a \u2018Fatal error: null\u2019 message upon completing level 5, which froze the game for no apparent reason.)  My protection levels were sufficiently high so that by the time I had to communicate comet hits, I successfully avoided damage from each.\n\nThe change I propose, which may not be so simple, would be to add a behavioral challenge to each level.  In reality, it is a requirement for most leaders to please the people they govern.  It would be interesting to have a rating scale in which your actions affect the city\u2019s opinion of your leadership.  If this number is sufficiently high, no issues arise.  However, if this rating scale drops below a certain point, the people could begin to reject your choices and you would fail.

I must admit it\nwasn\u2019t that easy for me. But once I figured out how to prepare for\ncomets and how to cope with the situation once the Alora gets hit, I was able\nto develop and upgrade my pods more safely, I mean at least without trembling\nfor a catastrophic hit. I think the most fundamental choice, trade-off that one\nhad to face in every second was between taking an action for development i.e.\nbuilding a new pod, upgrading or for avoiding risk i.e. increasing long-run resilience,\nbuying insurance, observing the hits for clear information. And in this respect,\nthe color of the development meter that indicates whether I will manage to\nreach the target in given time was one of the elements that I used for\nguidance. \u00a0If the meter is yellow-like or\nworse and I feel that I\u2019m moderately safe, I focused more on building and upgrading\nmy pods while relying heavily on research, keeping an eye constantly for the closest\ncomets. If it\u2019s green-like or better, I made investment for long-term\nprotection. If there is an emergency and a catastrophic damage is at hand and I\u2019m\nnot adequately resilient, I took insurance, or extended its coverage for\nrecovery. That helped really much for the compensation. Otherwise, the repairment\nexpenses became overwhelming and I failed to reach even the pre-disaster\nconditions given the limited time that I had. Since I opted for an extended\ninsurance as a last chance, compared to protection and research that I mostly preferred,\nalso more affordable when applied effectively, the benefits of insurance was also\nimmediate, similar to research in this sense. Observing and gathering\ninformation provided immediate advantages in terms of reducing uncertainty,\nreleasing the tension about what is the best to do next. The benefits of\nprotection were rather remote, but most effective I would say. I played the\ngame more than once, actually many times. The thing I learned about research is\nthat it is not enough just to click once on the comet and rely on the first\nimpression. That frequently led to underestimation of the potential damage, and\nalso misleading results for chance of hit and severity. About the long-term\nprotection, I learned that there was an average level of protection that has to\nbe maintained, given such a habitat. It was also better not to make a big payment\njust before an approaching hit. It is quite possible that you will crave for cash when the repairment is necessary.

With adequate research one can evaluate the adverse of an incoming risk,the severity of the risk on the developmental process, and the impact of the risk on the people.When adequate research is carried out, it affords one the opportunity to create community connection even when hit by the potential shock.secondly, getting insurance from private and other organisation helps to reduce the cost of adverse potential shock on the community and hence getting insurance is an efficient and effective role of risk management.\n\n2.What i did differently the other time of playing the game was investing more time into research which affords me to create community connection when hit by severe shock.\nThe main things I learnt from the game is that TIME is an important factor in development face and investing the time wisely helps one to build a better society.And that every thing done requires finance.\n\n3.The change i will propose are:\na.

The role of risk management in this game seemed to be preparing for the shocks that came from the comets hitting the planet, minimizing the damages that may occur, coping with what happened if they did impact the planet, and trying to avoid damaging effects. \nthere were obviously other components to the risk management strategies like  building communities before strikes in order to strengthen the community and allow for optimum growth through networking afterwards. the research component was also a large factor in managing the risk. by knowing as much about the possibility of strikes or the likelihood of it hitting were great contributing factors to not only minimizing the detrimental impact but also knowing how to prepare for example the level of insurance that may be required.\n\nAs I played the game several times there were trade off that I made in each situation. I realized that doing research was essential but not spending to much time on comets that were unlikely to hit or if they were going to have little impact. Raising the level of the village was useful only sometimes and at a certain point it no longer paid off but actually cost more to raise it for protection. Getting to much insurance left you with little money to rebuild after multiple strikes so you had to trade off the level of insurance with the needs of building and rebuilding the community.\n\n2. As I played several times I realized what each of the options gave to the player in regards to value for money spent. At first I thought insuring at a high rate which resulted in costing less to rebuild was essential but realized quickly this was not the case. Changing the levels of insurance as the levels of the game changed was much more productive to 'risk management'. Connecting the pods as quickly as it was affordable turned out to be a good strategy. Getting ample knowledge through research on the highest risk comets made me more successful gaining higher levels in the game. Knowledge is essential in managing risk.\n\n3. There were several thing I felt I learned form this exercise. Beyond learning that there were several components to be watched at all times and it was like having juggling balls in the air and if one fell or you took your eye off it the others were soon to \"crash\".\n\nOther things I learned were taking preventative measures is imperative to success in risk management. \nKnowledge is very important and by using  this strategy it can improve your ability to take action in protecting against whatever you are dealing with. Although you can't spend all your efforts and energy in \"research\" as it will take your concentration off the other important components.\nHaving the right type and correct level of  insurance can certainly help people either take more risk or recuperate from disaster. More insurance   or over insuring is not always helpful or beneficial.\nCoping ability comes from a variety of sources and there have to be sustainable methods in place to help people, communities, societies and countries survive. Coping is strengthened by the bonds that people have with others\n\nIn closing I found this game to be frustrating and challenging but very effective and invigorating as a  learning tool. It certainly illustrated the concepts of the readings and lectures in the course work in a very interactive way. I spent considerable time getting to the level I did and then trying to better my 'score' and hopefully learning more about the need of all the components of risk management and what it takes to be successful.\n"}, "228": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "The individual demonstrated engagement with the game and understood the need for trade-offs in the promotion of development.", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "I took a about five hours to reach level 4, broken into two attempts. \u00a0The first attempt was for four hours where I reached up to level 3. \u00a0I decided to stop the game and reflect on the actions that I have taken during those three hours. \u00a0The next time, I was more aware and sensitive to the different variables that are interacting in the game. \u00a0There are at least seven variables that one has to monitor, evaluate, analyse and subsequently decide on the course of action to take. \u00a0These eight variables are the (1) number of pods, (2) the elevation of the community to protect from the incoming surges, (3) the protection of the pods, (4) the severity of the incoming comet, (5) the chances of hit of the comet, (6) the research on the incoming comet, (6) the insurance, and (7) the cost of the course of action for each of these variables. \u00a0"}, "229": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "-Understanding that risk management allows to maximize the realization of opportunities.\n-Risk management in the reflection appears impassive, \"hobbled\" in the game experience. \n427 words 2519 characters", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "-Understanding that risk management allows to maximize the realization of opportunities.\n-Risk management in the reflection appears impassive, \"hobbled\" in the game experience. \n427 words 2519 characters", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "Risk Horizon: lessons about risk management"}, "230": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "This reflection points out the importance of the risk management emphasized in the first  two weeks of the course.

I did invest too much time on knowledge gathering. I would still do but I will do that if I see that very few risks are coming and I have time.\nI would rather invest in insurance and keep upgrading it. Time is also very important.

For example, if the severity of impact is high, the value at risk (100% of 3 pods = 600) should be shown in the option. It could have been put like one chart saying this option costs this but saves that much etc. We cannot put\nnumber for human life.

However, the island is continuously subjected to the threat of comets. When the comets strike and hit on the island, the pods built will be damaged and the island will be scorched and turned uninhabitable.  \n\nSo, ways must be thought out to build pods on the island on the one hand and protecting the buildings from the threat and damage done by the comets. Ways of protection will involve risk management.           \n\nThe risk management involves a few basic steps and requirements. \n\nThe first step is to do some research on the comets in the sky.  The power to look out into space and learn the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet will give some idea to the player whether to neglect the comet (with little chance of hitting) or step up protection for the comet (with high chance of hitting). Also, the longer you do the research on the comet, the higher chance for you to mitigate the effects of the hit after the comet strikes on the island. \n\nThe second step is to do protection. If the slider on the bottom right of the screen is pressed and held into the upright position to raise your island. By matching the level of protection with the severity of the comet, one will prevent one\u2019s pods from being damaged!\n\nThe final step available is to obtain insurance for the pods built. The insurance policy must be carefully selected so that the smallest premium spent can offer enough protection against the comets striking.\n\nHowever, the preparation for risk will affect the development. When you do the research on the comet, the development will be halted. When you uplift the slider on the bottom right, the development cannot take place at the same time.\n\nAlso, when money is spent on insurance, less money will be spent on the development. \n\n\n2.  If I play the game more than once, I shall do something differently in the second time. In order to achieve optimum progress and wealth on hand, I shall research every comet and neglect those comets with less likely impact possibilities. I shall only raise the insurance coverage had I been sure the coming comet will cause a disaster. Also, I shall raise the slider to raise the energy level to mitigate the impact of the hitting comet. However, I shall upgrade the pods whenever possible.\n\nThe main things are the balance of the risk and protection. In order to obtain the optimum result, one must balance the resources on hand and sometimes moderate risks have to be taken. \n\nAlso, I learnt from the game that time management is important. This is because each game has only 3 minutes and time must be utilized wisely to build up the community and to mitigate any impending and afterwards loss. \n\n3.  This game requires a delicate balance between the various available options in order to build a healthy community. However, if I were to change the game, I shall do replace the \u201ccomet\u201d with \u201ctyphoon\u201d. Typhoons come every summer to my part of the world and if the impact is direct, much disaster will result on the land area. The research on the \u201ctyphoon\u201d will be similar to that of the \u201ccomet\u201d.\nThere is one more thing I would add is the option to construct/enhance city drainage in order to mitigate the flooding brought by the typhoons.\n"}, "273": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Great reflection!", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Great reflection!", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The game was effective in drilling in the lesson that when faced with limited resources and ever-present hazards, there is always a trade-off one needs to make in terms of allocating resources toward growth and development, acquiring knowledge about the hazards, protection of existing assets, \nand insurance.

Diverting some resources from development toward protection led to a decrease in the growth in the short-term, but the benefits were obvious in the aftermath of a disaster. Lesser damage to protected structures allowed for faster and cheaper repairs, allowing the rate of development to return to normal quickly. Purchasing insurance presents a similar trade-off.

While managing the growth of Alora, I tried to establish the town to its full size in level 1 and while doing, researched the comets. Good side about researching is it doesn\u2019t stop your development unlike protection which enabled me to reach to the required level way before the time stopped.  However, starting from level 2, I had to both spend money on insurance (75%) and protection. No matter what, the town strongly depended on insurance more than protection to continue developing. Again, I reached the cap before the stopwatch. In levels 3 and 4, I followed the same pattern with 75% insurance and unlike some comets hitting it, none were able to damage the town.\n\nInsurance always saved my life and minimized amount of protection to the level where I hardly depended on it let me continue to the game with a decent flow of cash while researching the comets and enjoying the growth of the town. In level 5, I thought I was spending too much money on insurance as nothing had been able to damage the town before and I wanted to make a difference and bought an insurance plan of 50% and wanted to concentrate more on the growth of the town as I wanted to grow even faster than before. Well, that ended my growth as one comet hit the town hard and hindered my growth for good. It was too late to raise the protection to the right amount when it hit the town despite the amount of time spent on research it. So the end came.\n\nAlthough I didn\u2019t mention how I played the game in the first trial, I played the game 2 times and reached to level 5 at most. In the first trial, I worked more on the protection and minimized the amount of insurance and couldn\u2019t even reach level 3. On the second try, I did the vice versa and reached level 5. I understood that even though personal protection is important and should be done, private help from the state/government/communities in means of insurance is a must to deal with large shocks and help the community to look to the future for continual growth in the game.\n\nIf I were to change one thing, I wouldn\u2019t decrease the importance of protection that much. Protection shouldn\u2019t change the level meter to red. It\u2019s understandable that protection decreases the growth rate but so does insurance by spending money on something rather the growth. By spending on protection, by raising the hill, you, in a way, are opening up canals that would bring water which are need for the growth of crops as well as your town. The game, from my point of view, was underlining the importance of insurance more than the required amount. It is clear that insurance is important but I, kind of, came to realize that this game was all about the huge importance of insurance while paying little to nothing to personal protection.

The international community can help governments\nand countries that lack resources and capacity for risk management, because the impact of damages affect to all of us and our property, induvidual, community and worldwide. When we prevent in long term we have benefits not only in our purse or pocket, we can use the money in other activities like research or community business.

Development needs resources, resources need technology and technology needs research. A community struggling for its setup can not think of investing in research areas because of its high costs and complexity. Investment in Research arena is a huge challenge and is full of risk. After crossing through this start up phase, resources can be pooled accordingly and then be invested in the research area. In the context of the game,a balance was needed between the growth in the development percentage and the level of the ground barrier( symbolizing technology) to be raised. Moreover, Research was also important because it helped the community to tackle and cope up with the losses. The more time the community spent on this area, the better information it had accumulated. Plus, preparedness through research also enabled the community to spare some time towards better communication and faster rehabilitation. An area to be focused by any developing community is the importance of having a good communication network. An Adhoc Network must be set up in every disaster prone area to have an emergency contact with the habitats. Sometimes this emergency network can prove to be life saving medium of communication post a disaster. Survivors can help each other during these crises time so that losses can be minimized. During a disaster, their is a huge loss of life and property. Life losses can not be prevented, but after shocks due to loss of property can be minimized. One of the effective way is to undertake a better insurance policy which will help to cope up with the losses in minimum costs and investment. Insurance provides a back bone and courage to actually adopt risk for a better opportunity. An insured person can undertake more work and can utilize resources in a better manner. One hard truth that nature displays is that the time and resources that have to be utilized for the development scheme,some of them have to be used for preparedness against any disaster. That results in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, rather slowed down, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I had reserved some resources for research and preparedness. Most importantly, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. Sometimes, after shocks of a disaster leave a long lasting effect on the life of the effected people.The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game.

Risk management allows planning and strategizing the long-term future for the newly created community. \n\nWhat choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?\n\nThe balance between the multiple choices was quite difficult. However, with the information on resources and cash in-hand allows to do the trade-offs. The knowledge on in-coming risk had provided support to protect while raising the ground 40% and give 60% towards insuring the assets. The other option to increase the strength of houses been used as an alternate strategy in risk management.\n\nIn what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe recovery was swiftly handle accordingly with insurance coverage. The strong structure of the upgraded building enabled to re-build and update the damage impact. The increase frequency of disaster were handle promptly as recovery time was shorten with more resources on ground. The communication networks also contribute due to the closely built housing with-in the community. However using multiple level upgrades near the housing circles also reduced the impact.\n\n2 -If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?\n\nI selected between raising the ground and paying the insurance coverage. The repetitive game playing allowed me to be precise in balancing between both options. Furthermore, investing in upgrading the building infrastructure is also very crucial role to handle disasters. Overall three type of support available during the game and they are categorize as follows:\n\n1-\tPre-disaster approach -Upgrading the building structure and buying the insurance coverage\n2-\tDuring the Incident - raising the ground to higher levels\n3-\tPost event recovery \u2013 rebuilt and recover losses through insurance payments\n\nI learned that proper planning with a better knowledge of incoming events could provide fruitful future for the community. The awareness and publicity campaign must well planned as people have short memories of the past events. The trade-off between long-term and short-term objectives brought up-front with the community to build consensus.

What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?\n\nI will select to show the past trends about the events happened, the dashboard will clearly show the frequency chart along with calculated impact on resources spend. The dashboard approach will be active to send alert and updates to the player. The prediction mechanism will work to generate upcoming events and with recommendation approach to balance between the available support and protection. Timeline dimension will provide strong capability to enforce strategically for the future incidents.\n\nA recommendation dashboard to protect for the future risk will be fun thing to have. Dashboard with multiple gauges and dialer showing temperature, pressures, season of the year.\n\n"}, "341": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "Risk management within the game was\ndesigned around safeguarding a targeted revenue stream, whilst trying to\nprotect the assets required to generate the revenue.

It is made evident that knowledge about comets, their impact and chance of hitting was essential to keep on developing towards the needed score. Knowledge of comets made it possible to prepare for its impact accordingly. Whenever there was a moderate chance of hitting or moderate damage, I would invest money on protection for two reasons; one reason is that protection level stays the same in case the comet misses, so any money invested in protection will be used in the future and second reason is that even if the meteor hits, the impact will be less and only one level of security is lost. However, when the severity of the crush impact was high I would invest on high insurance since investing money on protection might not be as effective as the 75% return of insurance.\nI played the game twice, so the second time I did some things differently. First of all, I always made sure to have enough money for the highest level of insurance. Even if i had money to upgrade my land or higher the protection level, I would keep the minimum insurance money in case there was a comet with high severity that would make a crush unavoidable. Then I would buy an insurance to protect my income. Secondly, I would try to upgrade my water producers as soon as possible instead of building new small ones, in case of a comet hit I would only have to repair a few. The main things I learned from the game is that there must be a balance between money invested for growth, protection and insurance. Overspending money on insurance that I could avoid by just raising my protection level was a valuable lesson. Another important lesson was that sometimes it is acceptable to take some damage on insured property than overprotecting.\nIf I was to make a new version of the game, I would definitely add the option of \"black swan\". A Black swan is an unavoidable event that could not be predicted. Knowledge of comets is fine but sometimes knowledge cannot cover everything. For example, say that we research a comet and it's impact is low and chance of hitting is low, so one does not buy insurance and invests on protection. Then it turns out that the impact of the comet was far greater that no one could predict because knowledge has its limits. Then the consequences would be severe and our income will suffer great loss. I think that option would make \"gamers\" a bit more alert and to keep in mind that not everything can be controlled but being always prepared can mitigate the effects of a disaster."}, "351": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "A) The key strength of this reflection was the description of the elevation of community as analagous to in real life, as a risk mitigation tool.

The choice between these actions depends in part on how the (certain) costs of preparing for risk\ncompare to the (often uncertain) benefits of doing so.12 In addition, risk management requires considering different risks and the relative need of preparing for each of them (box 2). Given limited resources, setting priorities and making choices is both\nunavoidable and necessary. For instance, a family living in a violence-ridden community faces safety, health, and property risks and must choose how to allocate its limited budget to protect and insure against each of these risks. Likewise, a small country\nprone to torrential rains and also exposed to international financial shocks must decide how much to spend in flood prevention infrastructure and how much to save to counteract the effects of financial volatility. When risks are taken on voluntarily in\nthe pursuit of opportunity, another trade-off emerges: expected returns must be weighed against the potential losses of a course of action. This trade-off is intensified when a higher return is possible only if more risk is accepted. That is often the\ncase with financial investments, where a lower yield is characteristic of a more secure position, and higher yields with riskier positions. 13 A risk-return trade-off may also be perceived for certain development actions: for instance, public opinion\nand certain experts may link the pursuit of higher economic growth with lower environmental protection or higher inequality.14 Although this and other risk-return trade-offs may not be present, risk management entails addressing them as a legitimate possibility.\nRisk management involves not only considering trade-offs but also taking synergies into account. These can make both preparation for and consequences of risk less costly. They can also diminish risks and increase expected benefits. These \u201cwinwin situations\nare widespread and should be emphasized\u2014 which is not to say that they are costless or always easy to implement. Investments in nutrition and preventive health, for example, make people more productive while reducing their vulnerability to disease.15\nSimilarly, improvements in the business environment, such as streamlining regulations and improving access to credit, can induce the enterprise sector to become more dynamic and grow more quickly, while also making it more resilient to negative shocks.\nThis is all from my side.

Knowledge about the risks, protection against the risks and getting insured against the risks are important tools for risk management. Here, the chances of damage due to hit of a comet was a major risk hampering the development. Another important risk was flooding. Investment in the research to increase the knowledge about the comet helped in reducing the risk of hit with the help of timely development of protection measures. It does costed but helped in reducing the damage. Getting insured prior to the risk emergence helped in reducing further the damage due to the risk. The delay in research, protection or getting insurance leads to higher damage due to poor risk management. Timely investment in research and development of protection measures reduces the damage due to the risk and also reduces the time wasted in the aftershock after the occurrence of risk. I was not able to move quickly due to technical problems and so the damage was higher as I could not take timely measures.   \n\n2. I played the game more than once. However, due to technical problem with the computer I could not take quick actions and so the damage was more and could not reach the level 2. However I learnt that you have to identify the risks in advance and get insured prior to the risk happens and continuously invest in the research about the risk for increasing the knowledge for taking protective measures. It does reduced the damage in next games but at the same time it also affects the development and makes it slow. In the next trials, I started investing early in reserach for increasing the knowledge, using the protection measures to reduce the impact and inveting in insurance earlier for the risk which were likely to cause damage and leaving uninsured the risks which were less likely to cause the damage.\n\n3.\tThe game is very interesting and helping to learn with fun and experience and so will be having long term impact on the knowledge and memory. It covers the important aspects of risk management such as prior knowledge about the risks, investment in development of protection measures for protecting from risk and investing in the insurance against the risk. The game explains about the risk mitigation measures, the importance of their timeliness and quantity in which they have to be taken and what are the factors that hamper or delay the development process. Flood and earthquake are important risks causing damage to the development process in our areas. So I would like to add some measures for reducing the risks due to these risks. for example information about the rainfall and likely inflow of the water shall help in advance to take prevetive and protective actions so that the damage to the life and property can be reduced to the minimum. The game needs some smooth software platform so that the technical problems can be less  and the game can be played for learning an important topic by all including those having lower version of software and hardwares.\n"}, "379": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": " The key strength of this reflection is that the game does not reflect the crude reality where the communities are very poor.

First of all you had to be prepared for the comets because they may come in full speed and if you were not prepared they may hit your pods. You should be prepared in many ways, even if you are prepared for an imminent danger, in our case the comet, as it approached the pods it may change its characteristics (the severity, the chance to hit the pods), and for this reason a good research is always essential, as also in the game, this teach us that no matter how much measures have we take there is always a chance that things may go wrong, or in the other way you may take all the appropriate secure measures and in the end not to use any.

Although the game may seem very simple and childish, the impact for the fundamental principles of the effective risk management was very serious. \nI think that if I was asked to develop a new version of the game I would add the human factor. Now a potential damage only destroyed the pods, in real life on the other hand there are always human losses and casualties; this may lead us taking the risk management more seriously. Even if we think that the measures taken for effective risk management are costly, the repairing of the damages always cost more. Additionally we have to bear in mind that if the people in a community, city, country feel secure in it, usually they try to do more and contribute more so these places are usually lucrative, which can makes us see the risk management also as an investment.\nIn my place, I believe the most important thing that needs to be done in my opinion is to proper inform people about their obligation to implement the risk management in their everyday lives.  \n"}, "390": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "2", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The role of risk management determines the success of medium\nand long term development goal. \u00a0However,\nthe effective risk management coping strategy relies very much on the\ncombination of the knowledge on risk, protection from risk and transferring risk\n(insurance).

A country needs to be well protected from any sort of natural disasters and this can only be protected by means of insurance. A timely insurance covers the entire risk at the time of natural calamnities and disasters. There may be tidal waves, earthquakes, floods due to heavy and incessant rain , destruction by fire and other uncertain circumstances. Protection from uncertain risks is a bare necessity. A country needs to take enough protection for the safety of the environment after taking into account the climatic condition and the suitable environment that needs to be present in all respects. A country needs to change from the point of climate, economy and financial strength to overcome all the risk and difficulties\u00a0 that may come on the way. In this respect it is insurance that plays a vital role in protecting the country from natural disasters .The insurance company assesses the\u00a0weight of such disasters and protects by way of compensations. Until the risk is covered fully by way of insurance whatever the loss may have incurred will be made good by the insurance company. It only needs a timely assessment of the loss suffered and made good the loss so as to bring peace to the community and the world at large. Risk management thus needs much importance for facing unforeseen difficulties that may come in the way. It\u00a0is also important to say that risk management indeed is very helpful and advantageous if it can be rightly handled at the right time and at the right situation. One has to understand and study\u00a0the density of the situation that may arise due to the natural disaster and that too without fear. It is the independent decision of the experts who are engaged and specialised in world disasters and who can easily predict as to when and where such natural calamnities may occur, To overcome such risks , it needs to gather knowledge in a much wider scale, it needs to be well protected to ensure that such natural disasters may not arise in future and it needs to be well insured to the fullest so that any sort of natural disasters that may occur may be covered and compensated with proper assessment at the right time and at the right place. A country's prosperity depends much more on the efficient risk management which is the need of the hour. A close watch and good observance is needed to see that a country is well protected from any risk that may come on the way. .Insurance plays an important role in determining how much loss has or may have incurred when there is every probability of compensating the loss so that the good may be restored in due course of time. Thus, in the light of the above discussion, I come to a conclusion that it is knowledge, protection and insurance that plays a very important role in fighting out the risk and disaster\u00a0 that may or may not arise. If there is no such natural risks and disasters, the country is saved but if it does occur, it needs immediate protection by way of insurance at the right time for the benefit of the community as a whole and the world at large .It is insurance that will give full protection from such risk and compensate in due course\u00a0."}, "452": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The writer understood the premise of the game.\nThe essay could be written a lot clearer; an analysis of the writer's experience of the game would have been nice.", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The writer understood the premise of the game.\nThe essay could be written a lot clearer; an analysis of the writer's experience of the game would have been nice.", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "I have played the Risk Horizon game, and now I will address the three questions asked.

Each pod has a cost to build, and as these pods are built, the initial sum is reduced by the cost of the built pod.  While pod building, comets appear in the sky, headed for the island.  To win the game, the player needs to build pods to a designated value and protect the built pods from losing value below this needed value. Pod value is reduced by damage done by colliding comets.  The player has 2 and 1/2 minutes to achieve the need value.\n\nEach comet, as it appears in the sky, has knowledge associated with it.  This knowledge includes the damage severity to the pods if the comet collides with the island and the chance of comet collision.  The player needs to use this knowledge to decide on options the player has to minimize the damage that a collided comet will have on the built pods.\n\nThe options to minimize the damage to the pods from the comets are to obtain protection and/or to obtain insurance.  The player can obtain protection, but to do so requires time.  Time is important because the game lasts only 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Obtaining protection requires substantial time that could otherwise be used to build pods.   In order to win the game, the total value of the pods built needs to reach a designated level within the 2 and 1/2 minutes.\n\nHowever, increasing the pod-built total value takes time.  So, there is a time-used tradeoff between building pods and obtaining protection.  Obtaining too much protection might mean not leave enough time building pods to reach the required pod-built value.  Not enough time building protection increases the potential damage to the built pods when a comet collides with the island.\n\nThe knowledge provided to the player on each comet is crucial in deciding how much protection should be obtained. The knowledge includes the damage severity on the built pods if the comet hits the island and the chance of island collision by the comet.  This knowledge is a guide to the player on how much time to build up protection \u2013 the higher the severity and the collision chance \u2013 the more protection (and time) needed.\n\nShould a collision seem likely, and if the player believes that protection may be insufficient to minimize the pod damage on collision, the player can buy insurance, using up some of the funds and time otherwise needed to build pods.  The purchased insurance, however, will reduce the severity of the pod damage from the colliding comet and protect some of the value of the pods.\n\nThe strategy I would use, and eventually did use, after playing the game initially, would be to obtain sufficient protection where comets with high damage severity and collision chance appear.  \n\nA key point learned is to quickly obtain knowledge on each comet and to be concerned about those comets that have high severity damage and collision chance.\n\nIn a new version of the game, I would put more emphasis on being able to reduce the chance of collision as I acquired more knowledge about the risk (the comet).  This new aspect to the game models well actual conditions where more knowledge often helps prevent the risk (the collision) from taking place.\n\n"}, "480": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Key strength is the concept behind this game is well understood.

What I learnt then is a minimum insurance is necessary, but medium to high is unecessary if you have other measures like protection and knowledge working together. Knowledge or research as its called in the game, was useful to minimise the risk, the more knowledge one had of the impending comet, the better prepared and hence reduces the severity and likelihood of critical hits by the comet. Furthermore, if ample research has been conducted before the comet hits, there is likelihood to prepare and educate the inhabitants about the comet beforehand but also repairing the damage once the comet hit. The element of \"community\" where the villagers stay connected to each other helped with reducing loss from the damage caused by the comet. However, spending too much time on research was also detrimental if the knowledge learnt is not being used to develop or build the properties and upgrade them at the same time. With regards to the protection element in the game,raising the level of protection based on the severity of the incoming comet, did help to a certain extent because it increased the likelihood of \"misses\" by the comet but also the severity of impact.

Risk management consisted of protecting the pods from being damaged by comets(risks) and in case of a hit repairing the pods. The choices involved spending money on developing and upgrading the pods, researching the comets to gain knowledge about its severity and chance of a hit, buying insurance and also protecting the pods by raising the level. Initially I focused on building as many pods as I could. Then I spent time intermittently  researching the comets so that in case of a hit, I had sufficient time for building community protections and upgrading the built pods so as to reach the development goal. While researching the comets, depending on the severity I raised the protection bar accordingly. If I spent too much time on risk preparation tasks like on researching comets or raising the protection bar, I didn't have enough time for development. Likewise if I spent too much money on insurance or protection, I didn't have enough money to invest in development. The first time I played I didn't focus much on research instead I focused on development, protection and insurance. Because of that even on being hit by a comet I didn't have enough time to build community connections. Thereafter I focused more time and money on developing the pods and researching the comets while having a minimum protection of atleast 4-5 bars which got me through 5 levels. I spent money on buying insurance only in the last 2 levels where the chance of multiple comets hitting at the same time was more. Balance between all the three risk management tasks i.e, knowledge, protection and insurance is necessary to confront the risks. Raising the protection level to the severity of the comet, prevents it from hitting and damaging the pods. Even in case of a hit, damages to the pods can be prevented if sufficient time has been spent on gaining knowledge through researching the comets. Buying insurance helps cut down a part of the repair costs in case of damages to pods. In this game researching the comets gives information about the severity and probability of a hit both of which are relevant to taking decisions with respect to risk management. Whereas in real world not all times historical information about a particular risk is available, for SARS epidemic in 2002-03. This factor could have been incorporated in the game. Dealing with situation where information about the severity and probability of a comet is not available and protection bar can't be raised. Similarly all information available need not necessarily be relevant to confront the risk faced. Effective decision making to confront risks involves being able to distinguish relevant information from the irrelevant information and also using the relevant information effectively. This type of situation could also have been added to the game.\n"}, "489": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The reflection about strategies is not clear", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "The Risk Horizon Game"}, "490": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "The games somehow was frustrating also for me at the beginning, but later when I combine  protection, plod growth, insurance, research , level of risk and time  keeping the green level was fun!.

Next step was to upgrade the pods as this is more profitable. I did not invest in insurance even at level four and found that it was a total waste of money, that could be instead used to raise the height. I managed to reach level 5 using this strategy - Keep on developing fast (Invest all resources on development), any remaining amount that cannot be used to buy or upgrade a pod can be used to raise the level. By this strategy insurance is not required. Once or twice when the pods did get damaged by the comets, I did not notice a huge impact on finances due to the cost of repairs.

It demonstrated in a simplistic way that risk management is a complicated task affected by many factors. At first I leaned more towards a defensive strategy focusing heavily on protection but I quickly saw that I needed to find a balance between the three to master the game. Moreover, I witnessed that one's strategy must be ever evolving. Each outcome is unpredictable and the results may influence one's following decisions. Perhaps you focus more on research and purchase cheaper insurance due to the heavy damage from the previous comet. Perhaps you opt to build more as your previous strategy of protection, research and insurance successfully allowed one to avoid any loss. Perhaps you buy more insurance because you observe several oncoming comets of high severity. These trade-offs are effectively demonstrated in the game play and thus the game illustrates how one must use all three skills to adapt one's community to mitigate risk.\n\nI played the game multiple times and as I stated previously, at first I focused more on protection especially in the early stages of my community's development. However, this exhausted resources and prevented me from multi-tasking which inhibited me from building more, earning more and even buying proper insurance when needed. I adapted a more balanced plan as I became more accustomed to the game. I saw that knowledge indirectly affects protection as it gave the community time to communicate and respond properly to oncoming comets often preventing damage. This was a cost efficient way to adjust to disaster. I could build better homes. Also, with the additional resources I could purchase better insurance for the most severe of comets. Ultimately, this illustrated to me that risk management is a complex strategy that requires the proper amount of flexibility, planning and preparation. \n\nIf I could change anything about the game, I would want to have an explanation as to why I lost a level. I did not get past level 4 but it was not clear to me why the bar was below goal. I think this would be helpful in understanding in hindsight what prevented success a scenario. For instance to apply a real life example, if I moved to a a home in new area but wasn't aware that a creek nearby floods once a year, I may not buy flood insurance because I lack knowledge about this risk. However, once disaster hits, then in hindsight I can learn from this experience and prepare for the following year. It would be helpful to know why you lose a level so that you can adjust your strategy if you opt to try again."}, "500": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "This reflection is really good.

I also kept a good level of protection 6/7, or higher if the asteroid coming had a higher level of menace. While the villages were developing I always kept a look at the sky for new threats, and always as soon as an asteroid appeared I looked at its characteristics and tryed to make as much research I could on those with higher possibility of hitting the planet.

(However with meteorites of higher severity research is the only thing that can at least partially handle the problem.) Research, as far as I could tell, allowed me to minimize that damage for the meteorites with created severity. Insurance fulfilled a similar function. I found insurance particularly beneficial and made a pattern of insuring at the maximum level - that allowed me to lift the funds restriction on growth potential after a catastrophe. However increasing protection implied that the water increase was placed on hold while the level of the elevation went up - hence the pay-off for safer territory was very costly when taking into account time restrictions.

In terms of the tradeoffs, the main tradeoff was in terms of maintaining the cash levels for development while at the same time having enough cash for the risk mitigation measures. There was also another level of trade off involved which was among knowledge, protection and insurance. My strategy was to invest heavily on protection and knowledge to minimize the damage caused by the impact and hence afford a lower insurance cost. The impact this strategy had on development was that there was a rush/crunch towards development pre-impact while there was always little or no damage because of the impact.\n2. The game drove home a clear message that risk, though of varying magnitude (strength of impact of the comet), is inevitable.  Some risks are prone to a particular area while others happen sporadically (chance of hit). But for successful growth of a community, opportunities have to be pursued in this risk-filled environment.  Risk acts as a great impediment to development but there are always measures to deal with risk both pre and post occurrence of the risk event (comet impact). \nThese measures become even more effective when they are pooled together by a community (the island in the game) rather than an individual (pod) as it may be difficult for one individual/household to adopt measures of such high magnitude. One proactive measure of risk mitigation is to create the necessary infrastructure based on the risks that are repetitive in a particular geography \u2013 one example would be using proper construction techniques/materials in higher seismic zones similar to the angle of elevation on the island. The second measure would be community/state driven investments in warning mechanisms, like the research tab in the game which can be compared to the tsunami alert systems installed across the globe. \nSometimes, it is very difficult to cope up with the impact left behind by the occurrence of a risk event. But if the community can predict the frequency of the risk event, then insurance provides the best possible mitigation. One of the best examples is the rainfall insurance in countries like Ghana and India where the frequency of monsoon failure is very high. \nIt is amidst all this risk, that opportunities for growth and development are present. The construction and up gradation of the pods on the island cannot stop because there are risks of damage being caused by a comet impact. Instead, it is important to pursue these opportunities by taking proper mitigation measures, like the ones listed earlier, and cover for the risk event. \nIn conclusion, the game was a close replication of a real life scenario in any community and educates the importance of risk mitigation measures and community pooling of risk in order to pursue the opportunities for the great good of the society as a whole.\n3. One change that I would bring in to the game would be to create a cost benefit ratio for the risk event thus showing the importance of analyzing the extent to which risk will affect development and take the precautionary measures in a measured manner (neither over-invest nor under-invest in such measures).\n"}, "541": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "The key strength was that he recovered after some couple of falls.\nWell, firstly, there is no luck in the game since every proper decision making about the right trade offs to make is available to you: You had a choice of either concentrating on research, protection or insurance.\nAlthough the game reflection is not properly communicated especially say to someone who at a glance would want to see. \nIn one of your lines, you mentioned an avoidance of insurance. Pls note that no element of risk mitigating factor should be avoided, as such may result to a coping that will cost ten times higher than preparation.

Comets were observed so that you had a better knowledge/understanding of the severity/potential damage, as well as the likelihood/chance of being hit.  At the same time, you had the option to buy insurance and you were expected to continue development throughout.  By taking the time and money to prepare for risk (observing the comet, spending money to increase your severity, and purchasing insurance), pod development had to be postponed.  But then when the pods got attacked, you were able to recover much faster because of all the steps you'd taken.  So it was much easier to recover from a disaster.  To succeed at the game, you also had to balance everything, you couldn't just focus on one or two tasks exclusively.  Instead, you had to do all of them together and quickly go back and forth to manage your risk (from various angles - observing the comet, increasing severity and purchasing insurance) and increase pod development.\n\nIf I were to play the game again, I would make sure that I do all of the above (pod development, observe the comet, purchase insurance, and increase severity to match).  Initially, I didn't spend enough time on comet observation, but once I did, then I got more time to recover from attacks and thus sustained less damage.  I'd also spend more time watching comets that have higher chance of hitting (i'd focus more on those).  If a comet is less dangerous (less severe and very low chance of hitting), I would observe for a bit, but then I'd focus on other tasks.  Whereas if it was high-risk (then I'd spend time observing and matching severity).\n\nIf I was to make one change to the game, I'd add financial risk.  While natural disasters such as comets are risks, in today's world, particularly, the financial market is such an embedded part of the world, that it consists of a risk.  You could enable this risk by the pods not always returning a consistent stream of income, and instead sometimes they don't give you the revenues/growth you expect.  It might be too complicated to implement this in the game, but a simple addition would be to add a random multiplicative factor to the $ coming from pod development, and that factor can very between 0.5 and 1.25.  This way, you could demonstrate the financial risks that impact people's salaries and firms growth prospects."}, "571": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Very well explained and clear feedback provided.

This strategy doesn't work for me since buying insurance lost money which could be used for development or building new pods. For the second time, based on the knowledge of severity of attack, I chose the protection level matched to severity and didn't buy insurance at all. Most of the time, this strategy works, however, the knowledge is not accurate enough (uncertainty) sometimes. I tried to use two different strategies, one is buy insurance, the other is increasing the level of protection and making protection higher than the predicted severity. Both of them worked in some way, From the game, it is quite obvious that if we can protect well without vigorously affecting development, we can pass the level for sure. Once the damage occurred, it is very hard to recover, especially if the damage happened in later stages. Buying insurance would help recovery, but the effect is limited. I feel like good preparation is the best way to reduce damage and for overwhelming damage, insurance is necessary. In the game, it is hard to determine when would be a best time to buy insurance. Just as in reality, insurance won't be executed for approximately half of the times. Also, I found that if I build more pods at the beginning and even though each of the pod won't develop very fast, but the overall green bar grows faster in this way(compared to less pods with higher levels) I think this may implicate that the wider-coverage protection with lower level would be more effective than partial protection with high level.

The idea is that any community is faced with a lot of risks during its development continuously. An inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals.

Now, there are two ways to mitigate that risk: by raising the level of the community in terms of height, and by buying insurance against damage. But there is a catch-22 situation here: these mitigators of risk themselves present a risk to development. While faced with a shortage of resources (money and time here), adopting the aforementioned measures against risk would mean a wastage of these scarce resources in the event that the community is not actually affected (as in the case when the meteor does not hit). Thus, there is a trade-off between protection and development. However, it has to be duly noted that the more knowledge the community possessed with respect to the risks it faced, the more likely it was \u00a0to make an informed decision, that would be beneficial. Again, gaining additional knowledge involves some costs, in the process diverting resources away from development. Another risk is development itself.

I was lucky enough to be born in a country where natural disasters are extremely rage phenomenon and for the bulk part of my life the public sector financial crisis was an \"unknown\" word for me and for my fellow citizens. As a result, when the crisis began affecting the state which I used to live, things changed unexpectedly.

It gave me more time to raise my protection level and develop my pods, If the severity level and ch the chance of the comet hitting of the comet were high, I made sure I had insurance covering 75% of the loss. Moreover, if only the chance of the comet hitting was high but the severity level was low, then there was no need to expend on protection. Protection against waves was needed only if the possibility of damage was high. Therefore, to save money for development and insurance, it was important to match my level of protection with the severity of the comet to protect my pods against the possible damage. In such a situation, when risk is uncertain and complex, I decided not only to gain knowledge, but also to use the information with me to make judgement.

Another thing that I learned from the game was that making some connections with another pods and getting more knowledge about comets we could make more time in order to identify them, and also diminishing the uncertainty on how a comet may cause damage.\n\nI would add a simple thing in the game that is make more accurate the knowledge, protection and insurance in real life, I mean, adapting that situation to a real life scenario in which we can identify not only the damage cause by a natural disaster, but viewing the cost of the damage, the human beings affected, those things that usually an organization reports after a natural disaster, but basically the game teaches us how to prevent a disaster, talking on risk either insurance, deaths, knowledge, protection, or others aspects in risk management in order to overcome a disaster and getting the less damage.\n"}, "629": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "It appears you played the game, and as you said had trouble understanding what you were to do.

My goal was to achieve the minimum level requested for each level and have enough money available for recovery in case of damages. \nNevertheless due to limited resources and time I could not have an healthy and enough fast development and using protection, insurance and research at the same time. Therefore I had also to evaluate which one among the three protection tools was the best.\nI invested more in protection instead of research and insurance. Protection was for me the best measures to prevent pods for being damage: it was an enduring protection in every level. In my option the trade-off was related to the ability in using insurance and research only when strictly necessary, in the specific case only when the impact\u00b4s severity and chance of hit by a comet were both high. Indeed, I didn\u00b4t understand how it worked the connection among the pods in case of hit by a comet. However I saw that more I clicked and more I created connection (I suppose that the green clouds on the pods were the connections) with the results of reduce the shocks of the comets \u00b4impact. It worked also very well. \nHowever I noticed that risk management concerned not only the costs but also the Timing: the decision to invest more in insurance and research had not be taken too late, otherwise their impact would be pointless.   \nEven if I live near a big river, now there are not many risks regarding natural disaster: Thank to what government did in the past (monitoring of the river flood, building banks, etc\u2026). I think that was a good example how  risk management is important for community development.\nThe risk management was necessary in order maximize the use of limited resources, but also the times in which resources should be used.

I found that there was a diminishing rate of return from protection, particularly when the threat was severe. I also learnt that the severity of risk did not always equate to the size of the damage. While playing in Level three, I found that it was very difficult to generate wealth in the community.  While investing large sums in the community, the rate of return on investment was slow. \n\nI played the game numerous times to try out different strategies. I tried just buying insurance and building a community as quickly as possible. Sometimes this worked, other times it didn't as it didn't generate significant wealth.

Earthquakes will roll underground  across the screen, at various depths and severity, monitored by a seismic recorder, which will let you know the severity of the quake.  The timeline for building each floor, and the amount of money available will be similar to the comet game. The one thing I would include in the game is an evacuation strategy to be included in the build.

I reached level 5 after three failed attempts to pass level 3 once I realized that 1) I could not focus solely on creating and improving pods, 2) purchasing insurance was expensive, and if the buildings were damaged I would have to pay more, 3) that defending the city by increasing the height above sea level took time and money, and 4) it was very important to research comets prior to their arrival as it could improve the city's defense. Preparation for risk often involved taking away precious resources of time and money away from development. However, during these failed attempts I came to realize that a strategic combination of all four would be needed to pass level 3. \nIn my successful venture I followed the following procedure. In the first level I developed five level one pods, which is how many you can make with the initial investment. In previous attempts I had developed as many level one pods as possible, but that did not allow for adequate risk preparation. I raised the city to level 3 protection in between researching comets. I took advantage of the end of the level after I had already reached my goal, because I had enough income and there were no more comets. In level 2, I improved the existing pods and developed the rest of the land with level one pods. I raised the city to level 5 protection. I usually tried to research comets up to level 6 to ensure I would have enough time to form enough connections. Otherwise I relied on the city's existing defense if the comet's damage was low. I continued this strategy of developing my pods, researching comets, and building my defense up to level 7 until level 4, during which I first purchased insurance, because the comets were becoming stronger and more frequent and I did not have ample time to build the city defense. In level 5, I purchased the maximum amount of insurance for $852 and after a level 8 comet damaged my city, I had to pay $161 per building for repairs. This burden of cost and lowered production created a major setback and I was unable to reach my goal. In addition, the time it took to improve pods to level 5 was much longer and after the attack, I did not have ample time and money to improve all the pods. \nIf I were to play the game again, I would try to focus on improving city defense manually because it is the cheapest option and not to buy insurance because it is quite costly and after the city is damaged, it takes more time and money to recover which can be a fatal blow. I would also try to accumulate an excess income prior to level 5 in order to allow enough time for all my pods to be upgraded once more to reach my goal.\nIf I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, a minor change I would make to better reflect the place in which I live would be to add the possibility to add more types of defense like missiles to intercept and explode the comets prior to impact.

In my first attempt, I could not achieve the desired results since I had allocated a major chunk of the resources on development and in the process had overlooked the preparation required to mitigate risks. Inspite of initial growth, this led to massive destruction in the later stages.  Also I was consistently trying to optimize the resource utilization by giving each and every Power i.e. knowledge, protection and insurance equal weight without classifying the comets on the basis of their severity of impact/probability of hitting. \nThe next time I played the game I was able to comprehend the game better. I allotted the resources wisely to reduce and mitigate the risk as well as took the opportunities available for the growth of the community Alora. \nThe main learning from the game was that managing risk is an equally important part in the development of a community. In the case of Alora, it was seen that the community simply perished in the absence of proper risk management. Risk management is mostly seen as a cost/waste of resources. However this is not the case. An active preparation of an event before it actually occurs and an action plan in case a catastrophe hits, should be in place. Also all the constraints should be understood properly and only then an action plan to reduce risk should be developed.\n\nIn India one of the major problems is drought. A lot of farmers are dependent on rain for the crops. However rainfall in India is erratic. There is a high risk since in the absence of regular and continuous rainfall, crops perish. This leads to high rates of farmer suicides during such periods.  For the survival of crops, this risk needs to be managed actively. This can be done by reducing the dependence on rains by having water canal systems and artificial means of water supply. Such measures will keep the farmers prepared for drought like situations, thereby reducing the level of impact and leading to higher levels of production. This risk due to uncertainty in rainfall is one feature that can be added in a new version of the game.\n"}, "710": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Good thinking and bravo for your hard work.", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Good thinking and bravo for your hard work.", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The main idea of the game is based on the two essential objectives of Risk Management which are produce resilience by\u00a0"}, "711": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Nicely articulated with clarity and explanation, easy to understand,  knowing the subject very well and since there is always room for improvement so it can more professionally articulated by giving examples of risk management in real world scenarios.

One of the aspects of risk management is to manage natural risks which are intrinsic to the region, in this case the risk being the meteor strikes. So to develop the community or in other words to advance to the next level in the game we need to have enough resources which are gathered by the pods, but the meteor strikes hamper this development by damaging the pods. So we need to find the right balance between development and managing risk by using tools such as insurance and community co-ops etc., which are provided in the game. The main choice which I had to make was how to balance between development and protection(managing risk). If more resources were to be spent on risk management alone then the rate of development would lag and we would fail to advance. So at times instead of completely averting the risk it was easier to manage the after-effects of risk once it has been realised, through means such as insurance and community co-op which are provided in the game.

I used maximum Protection, I think if we conscious about the future happen we can minimize the risk and I save my plot and pod from the comets.

The powers of research, protection and insurance were the strategies without which risk could not be managed and would have resulted in greater loss due to disaster. In order to maintain the balance between development and protection, several trade offs were faced along with managing the finance for risk management, protection from shocks, insurance and development of the community. The limited financial resources called for their distribution in an economical and efficient way. The most important trade off faced was between investing in development and in protection. In order to protect the community from the disaster and the following loss, providing protection was inevitable. The insurance helped in reducing the extent of damage caused as the insurance companies provided with monetary aid to repair. As a result, these activities involved in risk management affected the development by reducing its pace. Development of community stagnated for a while when the finance was being used for protection and insurance. However, the development did not show any depleting trend. Playing the game four times taught me the importance of development within the limited time frame. Keeping a pace with the development level along with the protection and insurance level was an essential to win the game. Thus, by taking this factor in account I accomplished three levels and reached fourth. I lost the game twice while I was about to reach the fifth level. The game taught the essentials of developing a community with keeping every aspect in mind particularly the risk management for the potential danger that could accompany severe loss. The game was self explanatory which was its best quality. The good difficulty level showed that the strategies of risk management require both time money and resources. \nIf tasked with development of new version of the game I would like to add up some more risk management strategies apart from the powers of research, insurance and protection. Migration of the people living in the community to safer areas when the warning is provided \u2013 is a component important to risk management. By adding this dimension to the game people will avail the opportunity to safeguard themselves by moving to safer ares.Improving the research facilities and early warning systems could strengthen the protection.  Also, improving the after damage aid will provide a commendable assistance. \nOverall, the game experience was challenging and memorable.

The one risk I had trouble managing was the rising of the planet surface to assist with the protection of the planet.

There are\n3 ways to do so, namely was by either protecting the settlement by raising it\non a platform, purchasing insurance, or by upgrading pods in order to get a\ngreater amount of return. Knowledge on how each of these mechanisms performed\nwas crucial to certain choices. For example, in the initial stages, it was\nimperative to sink a significant portion of capital in to insurance and\nprotection in order to protect whatever little pods were present (just 2 or 3).\nHowever, care need to taken to not overdo this as low wealth can be crippling\nto development. Next, it became clear that the focus shifted to the actual\nconstruction of pods and their development. It seemed more prudent to upgrade\nall pods to certain stage before moving on in order to prevent disparity.\nAdditionally, the balance between insurance and protection played a key factor.\nAs time progressed, it was apparent that although a certain level of protection\nwas required, a medium level (about 5 to 6 bars) was sufficient to mitigate\ndamage by pairing with the highest level of insurance. This optimization allows\nfor the cheapest repairs though protection needed to maintained at 6 bars\nconsistently in the event of a meteor strike.\u00a0\nAnd finally, knowing which type of comet was going to strike was very\nimportant. Comets with low damage and low probability could effectively be\nignored, while those with medium to high damage required the most attention, regardless of probability. Patterns start to arise once the game is played\nmultiple times. For example, with an impending strike of 2 or more comets\nconsecutively, it was more prudent to repair immediately after the first strike\nat earlier stages (when protection was lower) otherwise there might not have\nbeen any pods to repair at all. But once protection was sufficient, repairs\nmay be handled after the second strike in order to reduce costs. The game\nserves to teach that knowledge is most important and that a certain balance of\ninsurance and protection are extremely important (having only one or the other\nis not sufficient to mitigate all of the risk). Also having connections were\nimportant too, though having a smaller impact. I would change the connection\nmechanism within the game.

In the game, Risk horizon, I identified the risk to the community as falling meteors which causes flooding and created a buffer by way of \"Insurance\", I analysed the risk by way of \"Research\" and responded to the risk by way of \"Protect\".\n\nInsurance: this allowed me have adequate disaster recovery plan. No matter,the level of destruction caused by the falling meteors, insurance made rebuilding and upgrading easier, faster and cheaper.\n\nResearch: allowed me to quantify the risk by evaluating the meteors and prioritising the level of risk and uncertainty and quantify their frequency of occurence and impact. It also was the fastest way to turn the indicator light from red to green thereby reaching your goal faster than would have been possible.\n\nProtect: allowed me to develop response to the identified threat by raising the level of the island in order to either eliminate the threat, deflect the threat or accept the threat and be prepared for it by raising the protection bar level. Raising the level of the community decreases the risk or impact of destruction. Though it seems the best option, it takes too long to get a bar on the protection scale and takes longer to reach your goal.\n\nIn level one, I quickly discovered that knowledge makes the task easier and completes faster so immexiately after building pods, I got a good insurance plan and then proceeded to get knowledge in order to reach my goal faster. I actually did more of research and less of protecting because the time between the sighting of the meteor in the horizon and its impact was  short.\n\nImmediately the game started, I went for an insurance plan to give the community some level of coverage. I alternated between research and protecting because I needed to balance both in order to achieve my goal.\n\nI played the game more than once and I,realised  the mistake I made was that not properly balancing my options lead to failure to complete the given task.\n\nThe most important thing I learnt from the game was the power of insurance. I realised that the cost of repairs and upgrading was far more cheaper with a goood insurance plan. \n\nIn the game itself, I would give more time to complete each level and make the acquisition of protection bars faster.

There would be limitless choices as to how one could manage the land and the people. \nHowever, for this game, it turns out it took me three turns to reach level three and I fell a minute step behind what it required to reach level 4.

I was tempted to build and upgrade and ignore the insurance and protection the first time I played. Lets say, I didn't do too good. I realised it is much better to prevent damage than to repair as it just used up much more money and moreover, time was another constraint. At the end of level 3, I ran out of time twice. Hence, I made sure that the amount of damage was negligible or did not occur at all. By level three it was also more difficult to get the 75% insurance coverage as most of the funds were tied into upgrading. So it was a tradeoff for development versus insurance. The next time round that I play, I think I will prioritise insurance to upgrades and see what happens.\nIf I were to develop a newer version, I would insert agricultural aspect to it. It would become more challenging as there would now be a tradeoff between shelter and food. As Maslow's hierarchy puts it, the fundamental need of humans is shelter and food security. It would be interesting to see how gamers would balance between the two most important aspects of life...save the home? or save the food?

After aquiring new knowledge throughout the course we exercite our knowledge by applying the best techniques in risk management to our land Aloria.\n\nOne of the things that I think it's very interesting is the bar that measures the development and the levels that allows us to win the game by developing our pods. This simple thing is very important because it reminds us our main goal is the development and not the shocks themselves. Our goal is not to avoid the damages but to develop through the shocks. Development in the game has two basic componentes just as in reality: quality and quantity (of the pods) which we must manage in order to go further in the game because they both require time and diferent amounts of money.\n\nThen we have three factores when a meteor enters our orbit that are very interesting and that became our main difficulty: Research; Insurance and Prevention. We must decide, we must choose wisely in order to avoid the damage but at the same time we must continue to develop our land, that is the real challenge: to manage all the resources we have wisely in order to develop more and more. I think if we only had to defend or protect Aloria it would be an easy task, the problem here is that we must protect but at the same time we must develop it and as usual time and money are always missing when we need them the most.\n\nThe shock is defined by three diferente factors when the meteor hits: Severity of the meteor; Probability of hitting Aloria and Research, the amount of research we get defines the time we have after the impact to react to the shock and diminuish eventual damage. We must manage and use this three factors in order to decrease the impact in our development.\n\nThe insurance has three modalitys: by a small amount of many we get a cover of 33% of the costs, by a medium amount of Money we get a cover of 50% of costs and by a big amount  we get a cover of 75% of costs. However we don't want to have to use the insurance because even with the best insurance our development suffers a lot if we get hit by a meteor and don't have adequate protection.\n\nThe elevation is the best way to protect our land and our development however it's also the most expensive and requires more time than all the others but in my opinion it's worth it.\n\nAfter playing this game a number of times I've tried diferent strategies however besides the strategy, luck played an important role just like in reality where we cannot guess some variable factors.\n\nJust like in real life we have to start the elevation (the preparation) in the beggining of level one, in the beggining, before we get the chance to be hit by a meteor and the first meteors may fail to cause any damage however it is the most important thing in the future as the game goes on.\n\nThe only thing I would add to this game would be habitants because their reactions also matter a lot in reality and we need to manage them too.\n\nAs so, this game is a simple replica of reality that allows us to practice and aquire practic knowledge about risk management."}, "867": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "The key reflection for me is \"Risk management is critical for development.\"\nI think if you use space (like paragraph) more efficiently, it's easier for me to read.\nBut, I think you have deep understanding of this game!

The risk in the game is portrayed through the meteors that may hit your development. The player has to manage the risk of the severity, likelihood and the timing of the damage happening. All this of course while staying on a tight budget as well as a steep goal to reach in terms of the development to successfully complete the level. \nThe player has to make choices as to what to prioritize: Knowledge of the meteors, Insurance, Safety, Opportunity of developing the establishments. Of course there had to be trade-offs for being able to finish the levels, and I played the game multiple times to find out the best approach to complete the task.\n\nInitially I thought before the meteors hit me, I would build as many pods as possible and in their basic state without upgrades, My next priority was to keep an eye on the meteors severity and likelihood but not accumulate the knowledge but to focus on improving my safety by holding the protection bar. I also purchased the most comprehensive insurance available.\n\nI quickly found out this wasn't the best method to avert the danger and at the same time develop my habitat successfully.\nNext I tried out building a solitary pod, buy the same insurance as before, but this time raise my protection to 1 bar  only and then get the knowledge about meteor to 2 bars. Then upgrade my pod as funds are becoming available. If meteor isn't likely to hit me (likelihood is not higher than 3 bars). Then I would rather improve my protection than get more knowledge about the risk.\n\nThis method didn't work out as well as I would have thought, finally I decided to limit my pods to 3, get 50% insurance coverage, and balance my time and money between developing the 3 pods and improving my protection to 2 bars, and then get as much knowledge as possible for the more severe meteors. The preparation for risk initially didn't affect my pods development much as I focused more on development and less on the meteors. But my final methodology meant I had to slow down on development a little and focus on risk management to get my habitat to the highest level of development in the end (after the meteors hitting me and the time running out).\n\nIf I was tasked to change or add one thing, I would change the way the protection bar works, I would make it more practical / meaningful than having the player to just click and hold it or the way \"make the connections\" to improve safety works. \n\nOverall I think the game did in a simple, fun and an imaginative way ingrain the fundamentals of risk management in me.

At the first glance it looks like any normal internet game with levels, but as I dived inside it, the game became clearer. It represented the basic instinct of taking risk, let me say how, it takes guts to clear your balance to set up the base camps, but the more difficult it gets to protect them, so there is a simple trade off between the ability to take the risk and go ahead with the construction of the camps or else decide judiciously the direction of the attack previously and build the camps at the strategic places . Therefore, no doubt there is always a human desire to be protected , but it comes with a cost, either one needs to take the risk or be safe , this is the general misconception , but it should be in the human nature to have a balance between the two, he/she should take calculated risk (like done in the game), because nobody wants to be out of the game in a single round :). So, effective risk taking strategy comes with effective planning of your ideas and concepts. The game taught this thing very nicely, and i really appreciate it for giving me the insight into the core of the risk strategies. If i played it again i would plan more carefully when to build the camps and allocate the budget tactfully.If i need to modify one thing in the game, i would add more adversary conditions with each passing level , like addition of more attacks, however at the same time i shall include some strong mechanisms to combat those, but they shall come with a price. This addition shall reflect the decision making capacity of a manager at the time of heavy disturbance, and by taking a small risk he/she can go upto the last level, but by avoiding some thing it would be harmful for them, and they shall introspect their decision later on."}, "895": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The Student had the chance to do the game again but did not used it, so the descriptions are not well enough.", "reflection": "0"}}, "reflection": "Hi, I am Heung Mo from Korea.

As I played the game, I began realizing the roles of risk management in the game. I think the major role of risk management is to first watch out the risk coming and to analyize the fast moving risk throughly to prepare for the some protection measures so as to minimize the negative impact of the risk. After investigating the characters of the approaching risk, I started thinking about the best possible options of what to do to protect the village from the impact. I should decide wheather a severity of the risk or the chance of the hitting is considered first to make a plan for the coming risks. I thought I should give higher priority to the severity of the risk because the more sever the bad impact of the risk is the the more damage the risk create though the chance are rare. I could not trade off knowledge and protection for insurance only because we could leastly depend upon the insurance if we would have enough knowledge and protection tools for the risk at hand.\u00a0 I believe the preparation for risk can affect the development instanly because we can predict the damage the risk may incur under the worst situation if we can fully prepare for the risk. I can definitely say a stich in time saves nien whileconsidering risk management.

It is the diversion from the expected. For anyone to effectively manage it, there has to be a trade-off between protection, research and insurance. None of these methods can work in isolation. All risks have to be researched and identified and then prioritized according to the probability of occurrence and severity of impact. Preparation of risk affected development in that I could not start managing risk before starting any development as there is no risk. However, after development, I spread out my developments so that there is no systematic risk as well as put up few developments that I could sufficiently cover using the insurance. However, for the developments that were hit and damaged, it required additional resources to restore them to the position there were in before. This also affected the level of protection to the whole development. Where there was damage to the pods, the protection that I had accumulated reduced making the developments more vulnerable even after putting in resources to protect them. However, there more developments I put up, the better it was to cope with the risks as the cluster would enable collective coping mechanism to any risk encountered.\nI played the game more than once and therefore I was able to learn that there needs to be a tradeoff between knowledge, protection and insurance for effective risk management. Moreover, for each aspect of risk management, I need to have adequate resources not only for development, but also for employment of effective risk management strategies. Moreover, different risks have to be handled differently as they come with different levels of impact and severity. Prioritization has to be done so as not to concentrate resources on a risk that although had a high level of severity, the probability of occurrence was very low while putting little effort in management of a risk whose level of severity was low but the probability of occurrence was very high.\nI would change management of risk through protection. In the game, the level of protection can only be increased but not reduced by an individual. This is because, in cases here there is no need of a lot of protection, and resources can be diverted from there to insurance or knowledge. This is so that, there are no resources that are underutilized which could have been properly utilized to manage the risks.\n\n"}, "921": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The changes suggested for the newer version of the game is applausable", "reflection": "0"}, "1": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The changes suggested for the newer version of the game is applausable", "reflection": "0"}, "2": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The changes suggested for the newer version of the game is applausable", "reflection": "0"}}, "reflection": "Delia Didier-Nicholas"}, "922": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The presentation of materials is good.", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The presentation of materials is good.", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The risk is to prevent the pods from damaging from the comets.

I tried all 3 levels and found that optimization is possible once the comet hit pattern\nis better understood and coverage is managed accordingly.\n\nThe most impact from damage was provided by the protection %. However this was the most expensive as well. In some of the tries, I ran out of wealth resources using too much protection.\nProgressively,the reserach on the comets, helped to vary the protection percent based on the chance of hit. This freed up resources for devloping the pods.

It seemed knowledge was the best way to increase your amount of monetary reserves and at the same time saving further development of the pods until there were only low risk comets in the atmosphere. Also you should not over buy insurance. At the lower levels it seemed you only needed the second level of insurance until the higher risk comets came and you developed your pods more then you needed the third level of insurance. I think that one issue that the game did not capture and an issue I have frequently confronted when I have been involved in risk management decisions in the New York City area is that certain areas and certain populations are more vulnerable to natural disasters than others and often when you only have a certain amount of money to allocate to all areas of the City you need to prioritize.Generally, the low lying areas (more prone to flooding) and also the poor, elderly or disabled are where resources are most needed. I think the game treated all the developments as though they all had the same risk even though some were closer to the water's edge than others and in that instance you might expect those properties to be more vulnerable.You also need to somehow be able to evaluate which actions will have the most impact and that may have been what was missing in the game. For instance, if had taken my pods to the next level of development as soon as I had enough money, would that have sped my rate of return on my investment and then maybe I would have been able to be better protected? Or if I had distributed flyers to all the residents of Allora about how to prepare for disasters (preparation at their own expense to some extent) and where to evacuate to in the event a disaster hits should that have raised to score as well? Communication is often an inexpensive form of risk mitigation that cities can undertake and I think it would have been helpful if the game focused on that aspect a little more. For instance, many neighborhoods and cities in the New York region have distributed flyers that describe what type of things people need to have on hand in order to be prepared for a natural disaster and also communicated the cities' central emergency centers' locations and where to register with the fire department in the event you need assistance in evacuation which the fire department has said has been an enormous help.

I played the game twice and there were different strategies that were adopted. In my first attempt, the main aim was to build the communities as quickly as possible. I thought that having more communities would help in agility, cooperation and sharing of resources when comets struck the planet. But at the same time, I bought the insurance that offered the least protection, because the first comet that came near had a low probability of hitting. But the strategy back-fired in the second level of the game because I had spread my resources too thin by starting too many cells and had to incur high damage costs for each of the communities because of low insurance. This caused the failure to move from Level 2 to Level 3. While developmental activity was on, the damages caused the future potential of development because significant resources were spent on repairs and damages and the threat of another comet ruining the new developmental activities did not encourage any new developments. As a result the Level 2 failure could be blamed on inadequate planning, preparations for comet strikes and spreading the resources too thin. The second attempt involved ploughing back the learning from the first attempt. This time, the game was played with a phase-wise expansion of communities and taking the highest insurance available. Also, the elevation option was exercised, which had been ignored in the earlier attempt. All this helped in crossing the second level, but the third level again caused problems to the developmental activities. Also, the comets were regularly monitored to check for the probability of strike and preparations were made accordingly. \nThe main learning from the game were that insurance would help mitigate the damage that is caused because of risks that are uncertain and are beyond the control. The lower damage costs would save the resources that could be exploited for better opportunities. Apart from this, proper planning and preparedness helps build resilience, which otherwise could cause chaos. Communities that can share resources and cooperate have an edge at surviving calamities. \nIn the game, it was observed that the comets struck at the same intervals and at the same intensity when the game was played twice. If given a task to recreate the game, I would design it in a manner that would make the sequence and the intensity of the comets striking a random event, so that the uncertainty in the game can be maintained.\n"}, "939": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "This reflection is a very clear, articulated and deep analysis of key concepts/elements of risk management and their interrelations.

The game \u201cRisk Horizon\u201d demonstrates the four aspects of risk management as described in the World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development.  The four aspects are knowledge, insurance, protection and coping, which in the game have to be in balance with investment for economic development.  As I played the game, I bought full insurance, which seemed inexpensive in relation to its benefits.  I increased protection to the level of the highest threat, when it was possible to do so without undermining my economic growth.  As for knowledge, I prioritized the most dangerous of the meteorites.  What was difficult for me was finding the balance between protection and economic development.  In the short term, protection reduced the rate of economic development of my small country, but it allowed me to avoid the drastic costs of large scale disasters.  The second time I played, I tried to be a little less cautious, and although I advance further in the game, it turns out I still invested too much in protection and ended up failing.

The player would have to choose between using their time for gaining knowledge or for preparing the communities.\n\n\u201cRisk Horizon\u201d allowed me to reflect on the diverse benefits of knowledge, insurance, protection and coping to risk management, and my failure led me recognize the lost opportunities that occur when we invest too much in risk reduction.

We know that risk management includes both preparing for risk as well as coping with the consequences of it. In the game we had the choice of buying insurance which was supposed to help deal with the consequences of the disaster (in this case the meteor shower), as well as the raising of the floor level, which was supposed to help with preparation for the said risk. In this sense we had been provided with tools to manage risk by preparing in advance and coping with damage after disaster struck. The last element of risk management is collaboration at the community and other levels to deal with contingency, risk mitigation and coping mechanisms. This was also provided as a tool in the form of 'making connections' in the game. These three elements/tools were packaged with 'research', which was essentially the use of experience and forecasting to predict the occurrence of the disaster to improve preparedness and maintain control of the situation. I found that knowing the level of severity in advance allowed me to decide by how much I needed to raise the floor level. This element also mimicked real life quite well because information about the meteor shower got more accurate with time, which is true of all disaster forecasting. This created a very real and immediate trade-off between the amount of time I could spend researching the meteor and the amount of time I could spend between doing other things like raising the floor level for disaster preparation, building more assets (pods) and upgrading existing pods to increase wealth. What I learned over time was how to improve the balance between the time and energy I could allot to each of these things.

If the risk may result in aiding the society in which it occurs, it is equally important to understand how best to make use of this, so that the society can prosper as much as it feasibly makes sense to. In the game, knowledge about the comets is the first step to preparation and greatly benefits the overall outcome. Once knowledge has been acquired, the amount to spend for protection and insurance needs to be figured out. During the game, protection and insurance are synergistic on the whole. However, I found that protection is often preferred to insurance in this case. Appropriately protecting the land reduces the amount of coping necessary after the comet. That being said, insurance is still necessary; more risks could be taken to improve upon the land if it was insured. \n\tOnce the three mechanisms affecting risk management are understood about a specific comet situation and preparation is in place, it may be feasible to allow the town to grow. Taking a positive risk is just as important in this game because it allows for more income, which can in turn be used to protect and insure it from larger disasters. Therefore, a lot of times, a trade-off may be necessary. If the comet\u2019s chance of hit and damage caused is low, then it makes more sense to spend funds on expanding the town, and vice versa. In the worst case, when a disaster hits and results in damage, community support is essential to rebuilding what is affected, especially if the town does not have that much funding for reparation costs. \nAfter my first effort playing the game, I changed my strategy to allow for a protection that is more general and can protect many different shocks, as opposed to preparing specifically for a single shock. With the limited funding, this turned out to be more effective and efficient in the management of resources available. If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to acquire better knowledge about the comets to be able to make even smarter decisions regarding expenditure on protection and insurance."}, "981": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "the player tried to master the game thereby tried to manage risks\nlittle more emphasis could have been given about the protection", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "the player tried to master the game thereby tried to manage risks\nlittle more emphasis could have been given about the protection", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "Research,protection,insurance and building were 4 ways to\ncope with the collision risk in the game.When I started the game, first I built\nas more constructions as I could, because with more buildings we could connect\ntogether and made the insurance effective.Second, I kept raising the lever of\nprotection before the comets came, which could reduce the damage while collision\nhappened.

The game calls for thinking strategically i.e balancing between preparing for these inevitable risks and investing in community development on the one hand and also thinking about the different tools one can deploy to confront these risks on the other hand. \nI often more than not started each level with Insurance, as one progressed, the insurance policies I chose depended largely on how much was available with the need to have small funds on hand for the inevitable repairs coming a distant second in my consideration. More funds tended to be made available if one leads off with purchasing an insurance policy option which I then channeled to properties. Property development was then done and continuously improved as opportunities presented themselves. Research was a sine-qua-non at every opportunity while protecting (raising the island) often came after the green meter is filled. In preparing for inevitable risks, I often slowed new developments but consolidated on existing community awareness relationships often by raising and holding the button on the lower right briefly and leaving it before the green on the upper left completely turns red. Toggling this button intermittently seemed to help occasionally.\n\nThe game could be addictive though, but one learned to thread the fine line between risk preparation and developing ones community which is quite a thrilling challenge once you get in the game. Spend too much on building and upgrading pods and you will be exposed to comets when they hit. Any damage sustained from comets hinders progress and often means rebuilding at great costs. On the other hand, spending too much on preparing for risks leaves one with not enough money to develop the community sufficiently to make it to another level. \nOne simple thing I would want added is building of flood barrier or levees, at a cost of course, as well as underground bunker housing. The former greatly reduces flood devastation while the latter reduces casualties in the case of direct comet strikes (given advance warning through research, people can be directed to such shelters in time before the comets or floods hit).

Risk management is an essential tool for development that is exposed to many risks, and an inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals.

We must decide the proper balance between taking on risk and preparing for it, or\nacting only after a shock has occurred. The choice of how much risk to take on will be affected by a trade-off between risk and return\u2014by reducing the riskiness of the development, we may also diminish the potential return we can\nget. Risk management can enhance development, allowing us both to decrease the risk we face in the game and to improve return. We have three options for risk management:\n1) Research (Knowledge), 2) Insurance and 3) Protection. To manage the risk these are the tools. Through research we get the information regarding severity and chance of shock. It helps us in making choice between development,\ninsurance and protection. Sometimes, it is seen that on account of economic constraints we make trade-off between protection and insurance. With less protection, damage occurs. But insurance will cover the cost of repairing. Thus\nwe can transfer the risk. Sometimes development becomes riskier if proper protection is not taken. Investment in preparation for risk mitigation means less investment in development, but the decision pays dividend in the long run.\nDisaster is mismanagement of development, while risk management of development is risk aversion. It is strategic planning in the game where we have some options from which we have to make our choice to get the maximum benefit.

Comets that flew in from the sky and infrastructure development were some of the few portfolios to consider. Poor management of these risks would certainly develop inevitable crises on the horizon.\nProperly managing such risk saw the horizon escape all the possible crises, but rather turning them into opportunities. Utilizing these opportunities contributed to the development and accumulation of wealth. Properly acquiring knowledge on the comets that threatened the horizon through research provided lots of information TO ENHANCE BETTER preparation thereby increasing resilience and protection against the shocks.\nPlaying the game improved my understanding on the importance of knowledge acquisition in solving problems. Effective research on potential shocks solves about 40% of the possible cost in damage that a community could possibly suffer from any risk. In the game I realized a possibility to develop more protection against threats after researching and obtaining confirming information on the approaching risk. I could conserve lots of resources and also raise the appropriate protection in required measurement making necessary preparation ahead of the threat.\nProper and effective networking was another way of minimizing the weight of crises. It is very important to act fast and accurately in other to beat the effects of all shocks. There are some threats that appear abruptly leaving the horizon with little time to make proper preparations. The good thing about this type of development is the ability to test the strengths of whatever systems set in place to counter any shock that appears with such a pace. From playing the game and progressing through the levels, I had total control with a good insurance plan and adequate funds to raise protection against such shocks only after suffering similar threats at the previous levels. This strength was only identified when I was able to cope with the shocks received from the threats already encountered.  \nDevelopment was affected in lots of ways throughout my attempts to lessen the impacts of the incoming shocks. There was an immediate loss in resources but an increase in revenue after threats are dealt with from claims in the insurance packages purchased. There were instances where I began to construct new structures even when I knew greater shocks were advancing at faster rate. That management approach was entirely wrong since protection was not heightened due to the absence of resources. It was only appropriate for me to continue with my development goals only when I had built great resilience through proper research and heightened protective structures backed with good insurance packages. It is always better to focus on development when better protective schemes are instituted to cater for any incoming shock.\nThe game has a very good way of introducing any player into carefully managing risks whiles improving on developmental plans. But I I think the introduction of comets made it an unlikely threat to consider. Situations presented in the course of playing the game are real and they all reflect on real issues in our everyday activities. In choosing a threat for such a game, I will suggest an everyday environmental threat like storms, tsunami, hurricane and earthquakes be presented. In doing so the player gets to relate more with the possibility of facing the threat seen. One threat that will perfectly fit into that of my community is rainstorms. Rain storms are a major to my community. Many houses are destroyed when we are visited with such threats. A lot are rendered homeless and lots of households are thrown into poverty. \n"}, "1036": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Nicly written\nNot all issues were referenced", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Nicly written\nNot all issues were referenced", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "Riskhorizon reflects the difficulties of risk management within a developing world with scarce ressources very well.

Nevertheless, they are indispensable as development is very likely to be destroyed if hazards hit the community and cause widespread damage. At the same time, community leaders do not only have to decide whether to invest in development or in risk reduction measures. They also have to decide with risk reduction measures to chose. So primarily, they have to decide whether to invest in risk transfer measures or in protection measures. The game actually showed how difficult it is to decide whether to invest in one or the other.

The first task was, in fact, the identification of risks and then the identification of a proper path for development. Building pods, imho, was necessary but they were too exposed to comets and floods, so the had to be upgraded with the best budding techniques, but they had to be insured, too. Not having much money I thought that a less than 50% insurance could do better that no one at all. Also research on the comets and uplifting the ground of the pods were important, even if it came with a cost. That is why I succeeded best when I did not build as many pods as there could be fitted in the area. \n\nI had some difficulty in playing the game, because on the first time there was no button for insurance and on the last one I could not upgrade any building, but apart from these bugs (or maybe it was my fault, who knows) I could see that the way it went in the best way it was when I built only three pods, developing them through the whole game. I couldn't get very far anyway, but I had the time to start another game I would try to get the insurance from an early stage, maybe the cheapest one, and to build just four pods. Anyway I am afraid that part of the game was to be played without much thinking, because the transposition from getting educated ideas to clicking on pictures lost something and I was really belied in having to play this after hearing the cases used as examples in the videos.   \n\nI think the best part of this game was the net of protection, but I found it too strange, because some part of it started in places with no pods. I think that an improvement in the game could be building community around the pods, seen as an aggregator for people as well as a form of economic development. I would like to see a closer connection from community (and their deeds) to risk management efforts.\nThe idea of a distant planet, as I said, proved good to introduce the problem of starting risk management form zero, but the aim of the game could be understood better than it was if only there had been a more comprehensible connection between the actions of the player and the turning to green of that sort of thermometer, especially when there was no money, no comets and nothing to do to influence pods or insurance for longer than a minute.    \n\n"}, "1120": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "I enjoyed reading the various successes and challenges the writer encountered in playing game as they mirrored some of my own experiences, but I wish more space had been dedicated to personal reflection than the detailed description of the game activities.

We need to upgrade the pods steadily and we also should not focus only on building pods without caring about how to protect them from disaster and how to recover them at the minimized cost. So we have to do the research to understand the potential damage the meteor may cause and have a good plan to use the money effectively. Because the better we know it, the more effective our plan becomes; so I think we should do the research of the meteor before we do other things for example: buying insurance, upgrading the building and so on. It becomes more difficult to make a good decision when the damage the meteor brings forth is high while the chance of being hit is low. Whenever I'm in that situation, I just buy the insurance and research it to reduce the damage I could do.

In the game, the primary role of risk management was to foster balanced risk prevention. I focused on strengthening protection while at the same time\u00a0developing several plots\u00a0and securing insurance. Protection, as a preventive measure, was of crucial importance to sustainable development because once a meteor struck, it was already very challenging to restore and take enough time to prepare to deal with subsequent (possible) meteor strikes. In addition, when the level of protection was high, there were only few occasions on which a large sum of money had to be spent repairing damaged plots.

Investing in greater protection could guarantee that no great harm would come to the population, but this would come at the expense of societal growth.  Therefore there is a trade-off to be made, to improve the lives of citizens investment in protection will not always be maximised.  The role of insurance can help smooth these decisions.  While some protection is needed to ensure that small level damage does not continually hold back society, investing in large scale protection can sometimes be too expensive, and thus insurance can make lighten the load.  However, when adding greater knowledge through research the decision to protect or insure becomes easier.  When you have perfect knowledge of what will happen in future there is no need to take out insurance, unless you will be unable to protect yourself.  This means in this game insurance should only be taken out when it is clear that a real threat exists that you cannot protect yourself against.  The advantage of using protection over insurance is that protection not only helps in the short term, but continues to exist in the medium term, therefore the investment made continues to reap dividends as the game progresses.\n\nThe more I played the game the less insurance I used and the more research I did.  Once you knew what was going to happen you could make accurate investment decisions in protection, and only seek insurance for extreme events.  Thus the more you play the game the more you realise that information is key to making decisions and the risk is taken out of them.  Insurance is only needed when you don't know what will happen, or you can't prevent it.\n\nThe game allows you to obtain too much information too easily, this element of the game can be reduced to make decisions harder and thus more realistic.  Also, while having so few elements makes for simplicity adding in other events, and investment decisions can again complicate he game and thus again make it more realistic.\n\nThe game did remind me of the floods that recently occurred in the South West of England.  There are flood defences there, but they are not designed for extreme events.  So when more rain fell than the defences could cope with the area flooded.  The government has clearly made a decision not to invest in greater protection and allow for insurance to pay for extreme events.  But the damage from these events, doesn't just cost money it sets growth backwards as investment is required to get back to normal.  Therefore protection is always superior to insurance.\n\n"}, "1245": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "This reflection is sequenced well, in terms of the order in which each of the points were put forward.

It turns out that if the pods get damaged, it will cost a lot of money to repair, and the development level will drop dramatically, sometimes leads to a failure in the level. So I believe it is always a good choice to fulfill the protection level first. I usually don't buy the insurance, as my protection level is high enough to prevent any damage. However, I do experience some time that the severity is so high (such as full severity but I usually just keep the protection level for about 70%-80%) that I get a little bit damage, which always result in failing that level. I usually do not spend much money on research in the severity level of the stars, but just check it very quickly and make sure that my protection level is 20% higher than that.\nI have played several times on this game.

Personally, I felt that the trade-offs were protection vs insurance (how much to protect vs whether one should buy the most insurance), protection vs upgrading (the cost of protection vs the cost of upgrading), upgrading vs insurance (the cost of upgrading vs the cost of insurance), as well as imperfect information in the game (i.e. whether to protect/upgrade more when there's an impending meteor strike). In my opinion, preparation for risk affected development immediately - for instance, short term costs included the opportunity cost of upgrading/buying new pods. However, in the long term, the insurance/protection paid off in the end.\n\nI played the game more than once - I scored rather badly the first time due to spending \"too much\" on insurance despite copious investments on protection, which then resulted in a lack of development of pods. After losing the game, I changed my strategy by balancing the need to develop and the need to insure. For instance, I tended to focus on protection rather than insurance per se (e.g. I would invest around 33% or 50% on insurance instead of 75% - this helped save money and besides, the amount of protection mitigated the insurance).\n\nI would add (economic) risk management to the game. Living in Singapore, we do not have much natural resources or natural disasters (as depicted by the game). Rather, as Singapore is a major trading hub in Asia, financial or economic risk management should be included. Moreover, I feel that diversification of assets can be included in the game (i.e. other than pods, perhaps there could be other forms of \"development\" with different \"resilient indexes\" to meteor strikes)."}, "1286": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "2", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The game that was designed to practice risk management was very informative and exciting.

If I had to change on thing to better represent the risk management choices would be changing the assumption of only one risk. There are currently a multitude of risks present and some of equally high need of attention, given limited resources, sometimes they compete and you have to prioritize. Adding to this you have distributional effects, the area and population are wide and disperse, it is hard to protect all at once you have to start on some communities and build on.

The insurance cost won't be too much of a problem for lower levels because the development is relatively easy speed up. However, for higher levels, the large upfront cost for insurance takes too much resources and impedes development significantly, especially higher level pods take longer to develop and therefore the cost in time is more pronounced. Additionally, although insurance covers a percentage of damage, it still needs time for repair and in the meantime, the development is slowed down. \u00a0Protection (leveling up the base) does not have upfront cost and can be adjusted to cope with the potential damage from the meteor.

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?\n\nThe game required the player to identify risk and evaluate them in order to protect their environment. The risks were the result of the comet hitting the land/water and causing waves which produced flooding. I worked through the tutorial a few times before\nstarting the game, fearing that the game would be played out much faster than in the tutorial, but this was not the case. The key trade-offs were between money and security. When I initially played the game, I either did not focus on insurance or undervalued\nthe cost of insurance relative the potential damage caused by the comets hitting the land. After a few iterations, it was clear that it was considerably more beneficial to buy a large amount of insurance and interesting, the game seemed to be played faster\nat that point. Also using the lever to raise the island \u2013 another means of disaster mitigation was very effective and even though there was a cost associated with this intervention, I seemed to recover wealth very quickly. The least effective decision\nwas simply to build pods and to ignore the comets. \n\nIf you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game? \n\nAs stated above, after playing the game a couple of times, I realised just how important insurance was to protect the pods and recover from the damage caused by the comets. I initially underestimated the risk the comets posed and was surprised about how damage might vary \u2013 in some cases it was over 70 per cent, then it fell to some 25 per cent and in some cases the damage was zero; again depending on the level of insurance purchased and the degree to which I have elevated the island. \n\nThe game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live? If I were to play the game again, I might suggest introducing some other threats so the players need to choose between more types of intervention. In this instance, the trade off was calculated in terms of financial cost. There was no attempt to introduce other costs e.g. if one had to choose between paying for education, health care etc. or disaster insurance.

If we spend to much time and money on thoughtless and exagerated risk management, our economy and society evolve at a very small rate, or maybe remain at the same place. So, the more i prepaired for risk, the less i developed my virtual country. I decided to modifiy my strategy, and it worked. First of all, i didn't spend precious time and money on builidng an escessive protection when the time for a strong one still didn't come. I directed the biggest part of mye efforts to the development of my pods, and bought the assurance only when it was necessary. The second important thing i deduced was, that there is no nedd to build a protection of a very high level, even on the 4th and 5th stage. Instead, I tried to research the comets that represented the biggest level of risk, so, when it felt in the water, i would be prepared to build as much community connections as possible. Doing this, my protection level prevaled the severity of the comets, and after that i just put a few efforts to increase my protection by one ore two levels, because it decreases automatically after the comet hits.

So you can think of insurance as a buffer, that helps smooth out shocks, whether they are positive or negative.   \n\nI think the readings basically have told us that there's much more benefit in protection than there is in insurance, simply because the cost efficient of protection is much much more, while insurance is guaranteed to be probably 1:1.  By 1:1 I mean for each dollar of damage that occurs, 1 dollar of insurance is used to pay for that damage, while protection often times the ratio is 1:3, where for every dollar spent, it saves 3 dollars of damage.  \n\nJust my two cents.

When you are trying to get first is building your main source of income, then build the protections needed, next use insurance to cover losses, and the last is increase your income here. In the game, protections become urgent when the meteors in a higher level hits your buildings and you will need insurance to at least reduce your losses. If you don't do that, your losses will be very hard to recovered back from its former state. At the first time, I was focused on building one pods, then do not use protection, because I was thinking that the protection wastes money, and I was using insurance alone. I suffered a lot and cannot reach at least level 5. My income was very slow because of meteors' attack into my building. The second time I played, I was diverging more pods, but still focus first on one to ensure my income is strong, then I buy protection and insurance as the game plays, I was failed in the level 5 because I don't have enough time to repair all the losses that I were suffered from meteor attacks. The key here is to protect your income from losses that could occur in the real life and don't hesitate to buy it as early as possible because you can't predict risk at all. I learn that protections are very important because it could help me (and my family) from suffering too much losses. Insurance helps me to cover losses faster, and I was able to create faster income when the losses are covered.

The player needs to determine a balance of taking risk to develop the community against the uncertain external risks posed by comets/water damage.  From researching potential comet impact (knowledge), allocating wave protection costs and finally determining appropriate insurance coverage, the player must balance risks and opportunities according to available resources.  These choices force trade-offs between development, conservation of resources for insurance and rebuilding while providing protection and information gathering.  Preparation played a major role in managing risk and opportunity as purchasing insurance and mitigating comet risk were critical to moving forward in development and higher levels of achievement.  The roles of risk management were present in all aspects of the game and a key requirement of a player's success in managing development.  The game also showed that it is helpful to learn from experience to effectively mitigate risk while engaging opportunities.  \n\n\nAfter playing the game a couple times, it became apparent that while developing pods, it was critical to address incoming comets as these produce damage that consumes resources and time to recover.  It is especially necessary to allocate time to protecting against comet strikes while finding suiting timing to continue development of the community.  I learned that the elements of risk and opportunity needed to be balanced to ensure successful, sustainable development.  In particular, it was far more beneficial to address comet strikes as they occurred rather than attempt to rebuild and repair after strikes.  The time and cost needed to recover far exceeded the costs to prepare and address comets and flooding as they occurred.  Preparation was key to successfully navigating the development in the risk environment.  \n\n\nIf I were to propose any changes to the game in a new version, I think it would make sense to assign varying levels of risk to different development locations.  For example, properties located closer to the water would require increased risk tolerance, insurance and recovery costs.  Further, I would recommend differing insurance rates for different properties.  These suggestions would likely complicate the game's clear message of risk management but would perhaps mirror risk management in a manner more aligned with actual practice.  Overall, I think the game is a good representation of risk management and the functions of research, protection and insurance as they relate to development.  The concept works well as an interactive exercise to demonstrate these principles and their context in a simulated environment."}, "1456": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "It was nice and simple.\nPlease try to elaborate a bit more in you next assignment.", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "It was nice and simple.\nPlease try to elaborate a bit more in you next assignment.", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": ""}, "1457": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Great assignment and very good suggestions!", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Great assignment and very good suggestions!", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "Risk Horizon"}, "1458": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "2", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "Note: I only got to level 2 and my code is wTktNq9\u00a0"}, "1459": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "While the response was strong in terms of answering the questions posed by the instructors, I wish the reflection had been written in integrated essay format as opposed to fragmented Q", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "While the response was strong in terms of answering the questions posed by the instructors, I wish the reflection had been written in integrated essay format as opposed to fragmented Q", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "Question 1:"}, "1460": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "", "reflection": "0"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "2", "reflection": "0"}}, "reflection": "The role of risk management on this game was helping to be prepared to the effect of the hit of the meteorite.

We also need to understand that knowing the key components of risk management is not enough to enhance development and coping with certain shocks. From the Horizon game, the key to a successful implementation of risk management comes only when there is a balance of the key components being used in managing such shocks before and after they hit. As a matter of facts,  the most important components of effective risk management includes; \n\nPreparing in Advance by Researching on comets, gaining Knowledge on the possibility of these comets hitting the ocean that causes floods, its Severity, obtaining Protection against this shock by raising our land to reduce the impact of the Comet on our pods, obtaining Insurance which makes it cheaper and faster to rebuild our damaged pods in order to find a balance between growing our community \nand at the same time, preparing for these potential shocks in the form of comets. During my game play, I made choices of researching Comets and knowing their severity which helped me on the insurance plan to obtain and the level of land raising protection I will need in case the comet hits. Also as a result of preparation I noticed a reduction in damages from 80% (my first game) to a subsequent 50% and 9% intermittently.\n\nIn continuation, if I played the game only once and when I am to play again, what I would do differently is to try as much as possible to raise my land in prevention of the potential shocks that posed a challenge for me during my first play. Playing the game more than once improved my understanding to an extent in which I realized we have to always consider all the components of risk management in order to find a balance between them to enhance development and the possibility of coping with shocks. I realized that whenever I focus too much on protection due to a potential shock by comets with high severity, it became difficult for me to win a particular level. Hence I always tried to minimize protection and focus on research, building pods and obtaining a high value insurance to help rebuild my community whenever i sensed a high severity comet.  This strategy worked for my progress.\n\nTo add, if given the task to develop another version of this game, I would increase the rebuilding speed of the pods which are virtually slow as compared to the speed of the Comets which approaches the earth faster than you could think. This puts the player in a state of jeopardy and one could end up making choices in a hurry which in reality we need to use the information from research to prepare and cope with shocks. Despite these, the game is very interesting and a great learning avenue. I would love to play it again and again.\n\nConclusively, I learned from the game that; whenever a shock is imminent it might be too late to protect or buy insurance but we can still make community connections in order to cope with damages or shocks or even prevent some of these shocks. In my community, we are challenged by the shock of Flood when it rains. To this effect, our community has been creating networks with nearby communities to jointly produce a solution to the problem. The major challenge has been; not enough resources and people loosing property for better drainage construction."}, "1473": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "I have played the game couple of times, but either it is too difficult, either I am not very good at games, the number of levels I have passed is small.

You can not spend all of your resources on protection or on research because then there will not be sufficient money, time, or other resources to build or upgrade the pods. In reality, you would be best off having ample insurance. During the game, I combined both high and low levels of insurance with more or less focus on other protective management tools in different game attempts. Ultimately, I discovered that the lower insurance policy was best because it is better to prevent, or developing ways to minimize effects of shocks, instead of having to deal with it afterwards. Concurrently, as the tutorial mentions, it is best to repair the pods immediately after the comets cause the damage.

As the houses were cheap, it resulted in fast development. Research allowed me to dodge the impact of most meteors, meaning that I could pass level one without too much difficulty. However, the lack of protection and insurance meant that if a serious shock hit, it would spell the end of the game for me. In other rounds of the game, I instead concentrated on building a few buildings to their max. This made it easier to rebuild after a shock, and allowed me to spend a bit more on protection. I conclude that even if the shocks can be foreseen, it is impossible to brace against them on short notice if no prior measures had been implemented.\nA community should therefore invest in efficient, durable upgrades first, with emphasis on investments that provide the most value for money, based on expected return. For example, insurance in the game was often not required for the first few levels, as protection provided enough resilience to withstand the shocks. Since protection did not expire at the end of a level, it proved a better investment, as it could help withstand more shocks later.\nHaving a small amount of very developed infrastructure also made it much easier to repair after a shock had hit. This could also be true in real life, where more developed and resistant structure would result in less maintenance cost, operational costs, and repair costs after shock damage.\nThere is also something to be said about the last minute benefits that can be gained when facing risk. Research in the game allowed more time to create links, which in turn resulted in better protection. Even if this protection was ephemeral, it is sometimes the difference between success and defeat. The real life parallel is that a community should always be ready to react and enact last-minute policies and preparations when a shock is imminent.\nThe game presents many aspects of risk, and still more parallels could be drawn from it. Real life is of course much more complicated, due to the many different sources of shocks that can compound and come up at any time, but the same principles apply. Between knowledge, preparation, protection, and insurance, the negative effects of shocks can be greatly minimized, and opportunities can be captured with much more efficiency, resulting in a better quality of life for everyone involved."}, "1521": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "0", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "Risk management helps to avoid damage or at least reduce it, so recover and reparing are fast and cost will be less important.

First of all, you have to build the pods and then manage them. you have to manage the risks by observing the comets, for example how fast is the comet, what is the severity, and how much research is needed. The way i tackled it was based on the severity of the comet. If it was very severe i spend my every dollar on insurance, i researched it thoroughly and kept the meter on the right on its pace. The more time i spent observing it, the more time i got in the end to recover it which reduced my damages very much and in some cases very severe comets did not affected my pods. The trade-offs were obviously money, to upgrade my pods or buy insurance. In some cases, the speed of comets was fast and i did not have much time to gain knowledge about it. preparation for risk helped very much. If you have enough resources and you are efficient in managing those resources the effects of these comets can be minimized. The main thing which i learned from the game was how to manage the resources that i have. Initially i was not spending some time on research and my recovery time was only few seconds. Then i spent time according to the severity of the comet and same is the case with the insurance. I bought expensive insurance which covered more for severe comets and vice-versa. I also learned that we can upgrade the pods the second time i played. It helped a lot in recovering fast. A person may not see a comet hitting earth in one's life, but if it would be an earthquake or a flood it would be more realistic. The pods can be changed to a house, or something valuable for us. My point here is that a person should feel the \"what if\" scenario here. What if he was there in a situation when you know a tornado is coming to your town. From my point of view it would be more realistic. \u00a0\u00a0"}, "1527": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Well done.

The role a Risk management is to balance all of the choices as best you can to maximize coverage and limit the damage at the same time, while rebuilding your encampment or whatever it is you are protecting quickly as to limit costs, downtime, labor, liability, and the total human impact. I played the game 3-5 times, and I did not make it past the first round, due to limited time for the day. My first game I did quite badly, and did not get more than\u00a0two\u00a0pods build and just assessed the game. Once\u00a0I had learned thru that first initial play I thought for a minute and planned.\u00a0\u00a0I did learn quickly you must make quick decisions on the comets based on a quick assessment, research them better to limit the damage they cause,\u00a0and prepare for the impact. Fast planning was another key, I did develop a quick plan based on the game itself and every play after that I gained knowledge. After the first round of play I grouped the and built the pods quickly and tightly, bought insurance, scanned the sky, made assumptions, and made protection in between as fast as possible. I did upgrades in the later rounds to the pods as it helped me improve my encampment faster thru increased revenue.\u00a0Movement helped, If I did one thing to long I paid for it, if I\u00a0watched the sky, I\u00a0did not protect as well, if I built to much I could not track the sky. If I could add to the game or develop a part of it I would add more of the ability to multi task. You can watch some\u00a0things and slightly monitor others at the same time, while every thing else is going on.

We can make a priority that can be done when idle to face disruption or disaster. Of the three elements that can be used, namely knowledge, protection, and insurance I could make a priority to minimize the negative impact of the disaster. The first time I did was make a purchase insurance. Why purchase insurance? It is very clear that when the disaster came, to fix everything needed funds. If there are things that can be covered by insurance, it would be useful to reduce the cost at the time of repair. Then protection. It is also important to be able to minimize that when a disaster or disruption coming, the negative effects can be minimized.

Now this can be done by building foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all. Because the problem is uncertain, because the problem is complex, it's very difficult to design a policy that will manage the risk properly regardless of how different people will react and how the context will change.\nSo we really need to implement basic policies that focus on what's most important, like setting the right incentives for people to manage the risk well or making the information available, and to make sure the policies are revised over time regularly to correct, over time, when more information is available or when we observe that some policies might have some negative side consequences.\nTo me the game should be simplified, with a real life scenerios or the game should be community based prototype approach, where all the features of a semi-urban community should be captured clearly, and I also recommend that when that is done it will go a long away in spreading the knowledge and create or raise awareness, prepare people mind on the impending risk we faced as individual, community, state, nations and as a globe which could either be financial risk, natural disaster, climate change or health related risk e.g the sub-Saharan AFrica is faced with an epidemic of EBOLA disease outbreak a very deadly disease ravaging the whole region, now since the spread is moving fast, the  second principle is to build foundations for risk management without trying to solve the problems once and for all.

I made made a number of choices and some of them include creating a healthy environment by accumulating the pods (development), which shows on the balance scale (left lower side of the screen) and preparing for the threats/attacks which are represented by the comets in the game. In terms of knowledge, protection and insurance, certain trade-offs were made. For example, while I was creating a healthy environment, I had to trade-off certain amount of dollars (resources) in other to ensure that the impact of the threats/damages is reduced to the affordable minimum through insurance. At other times, I ensured that knowledge was sought through research so that the impact of the potential threats (comets) was known before they actually took place. In this way, certain measures are put in place to ensure adequate protection. Preparation for risk affected development immediately it was done. This is because while preparing for risk, there is a little delay in the time that was meant for development to take place through the upgrade of the pods. Moreover, the resources that were used in preparing for risk also had some effects on the general development because they could be otherwise used for development.

The object of\nthe game was that you had to build your buildings and watch out for\ncomets which could potentially damage your buildings. In order to\nprepare for risks you had to protect your buildings by raising your\ncity up and buying insurance in case damaged was taken. Because I\nonly had so much money, both times I played I sacrificed building so\nthat I could protect the couple of buildings I did have. You could\nresearch each comet to evaluate the threat, which helped some. But no\nsooner was I past a minor threat, when a bigger threat showed up. An\nactual hit put me back financially and slowed me down from being able\nto build more. The first time I played I felt that insurance that\noffered 50% coverage would suffice, but when more dangerous comets\nappeared I found I needed more insurance. I had four or five\nbuildings that time, but I lost really quickly. Only three of my\nbuildings were upgraded. The second time I played, I purchased the\n75% coverage right off the bat, but that then decreased my money\nright in the beginning. I could only build three buildings, and I\nthink I might have upgraded one. All this is done against a timer,\nwhich I pretty much negated, since I couldn't really survive the\ncomets, anyway. There's a specific balance needed in order to build\nyour city, as well as protect it, and then insure it on top of that.\nI think I could achieve that, but it will take another couple of\ntries. I think one change that could be made that would help the game\nbetter represent real life would be to take into account the\nindividual buildings. Currently in the game, if there was damage from\na comet, I could quickly just repair it before the next comet (I\ntried to always save money for repairs, if nothing else). With\nindividuals to take into account, there's then the possibility that\nthe people in one building wouldn't be able to make the necessary\nrepairs before the next comet. If previous comet damage, or any other\nunrelated expensive decision, left the family too broke that they\ncouldn't make the repairs in time, I could end up just losing my\nbuildings. In other words, make it so that I send the money for\nrepairs to the building, instead of just directly making repairs.\nThen, put in a time limit for how long it takes for a building to\nrepair. Some buildings will get repaired, but one or two will take\nlonger, and so you have to work harder to protect the town. This\nwould be an annoying change, however.

The aim of the game, which is to maximize development by minimizing damages due to potential risks, is very much in line with the goal of risk management.The latter as we all know is all about increasing the benefits and decreasing the losses that people experience when they face risk.\n\nOnce a risk or a comet was seen on the horizon, the first thing that was done, was gaining information about the potential of the risk. Next came the choice or rather the trade off between protection and insurance. Both were a must and were resorted to, much before a risk appeared, but the proportion in which each is to be used, greatly varied depending upon the severity of the risk.  Effective research and preparation for risks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment for future safety. Insurance not only means protection but also facilitates the necessary repair work, whenever there are damages. Apart from all this, effective coping mechanism (promptly joining all the golden ovals to each other once a comet was hit) greatly mitigated the possibility of any damage.It is important to bear in mind at all times that development is the prime concern.Developmental activities must go on at all times. \n\nRepeated iterations on the game would make one more adept at striking the right balance between protection and risk. It will make one more prompt in development activities as they are the source of fund and eventually time translates into money, so the faster the development happens, the more money one gets. It will also make one more fluent with the coping mechanism. It is also important to understand here that as one reaches higher levels in the game or as society reaches a certain level of development, it needs more fund than before to protect itself from potential risks and to grow further at the same time. Therefore at those levels, the magnitude of risk management should also increase accordingly.\n\n Even though the game models risk management very well, a further scope for improvement cannot be ruled out. There could be more variety of risks in the game. Apart from comets and rising water levels, there could be earthquakes and so on. Opportunities could also be dealt with similarly. There can be a sample matrix correlating the risk with a given severity, the damage protection levels, and the level of insurance required.

Common for all attempts was a constant re-investment in upgrades of the pods in order to increase the resources available for more upgrades of both pods and preparations. In terms of my protection strategies I tried emphasis on research in order to increase community connections; I emphasised insurance to see to what extent a sustain-and-rebuild strategy would fare (not very well); and finally I also emphasised protection to better sustain impacts.\n\nPlacing the emphasis on one element of the three was not a viable strategy. I found that an emphasis on knowledge would nevertheless mean I sustained heavy damage from major events also with good community connections. A focus on insurance meant insurmountable impact on the development scale and costly rebuilding. Finally, a focus on protection also reduced the development levels, even appearing (imagined or not) to slow the revenue stream down (I assume this is part of the cost referred to in the instructions).\n\nThe strategy I found took me the furthest (just short of completing level 6) was an emphasis on both knowledge and on protection. I would re-invest generated revenue in protection, especially after the level bar was full, and I constantly kept research bars high relative to the severity of the threat of any given comet. I only invested in insurance where I judged the severity and likelihood of a major event surpassing my protection were sufficiently high.\n\nIf I got to add one element it would be fluctuating insurance costs which I did not get the impression are in play. If, like me, the player chooses to take out the insurance only after finding that one of the comets is a high likelihood/high impact event, then the cost for the insurance would go up substantially.

This game must meet external time-constraints which only having a few minutes to reach decision. In practice, the quality of the move decision usually improves the further the games look ahead. How safe is the move? The goal is to minimize the risk from a threat and at the same time is to maximize the gains from putting a pod. For me, as fast as possible, I put a pod before the threat comes. Once the threat comes, I click the threat and hopefully I do not get hit by the threat. I immediately react once the threat come. In addition, protection is added in full to minimize the damage that is caused by the threat. \nIf I were given a chance to play again, I consider to upgrade the pod as soon as possible instead of build several pod. Thinking too much about the protection of the threat might not a best idea to maximize the gain. If we have a chance, then we should go further to build and upgrade the pod and of course, we need to pay for the insurance to cover it. In addition, we need also to consider the cost effectiveness in building and upgrading the pod. Shall we build a lot of pods or build a few with upgrade pods? We can build pods with upgrade enhancements if we have already bought an insurance to reduce the damage from the threat. The investment of time and effort to decide should be kept minimum or in other words, we need to react before the threat comes. I learn how to predict the accuracy of the risk, how to prevent and minimize the risk, how to react if the threat comes, and also measure the likelihood of type of the threat. \nWhen assessing the risk, we should take a look at several alternatives that can preserve our capital. I would add a bonus to increase our capital, so we can build and upgrade in a faster method. In addition, there should be another ways how to prevent the threat hitting us. For example, we can add more alternative ways to protect our pods. Not just the insurance to protect, but there should be another alternatives besides insurance to cover for the risk. Additional information such as how to measure the dependency of each move should be known to player so the player knows the likelihood of the threat, how strong is the threat so the player can prepare for an assessment to reduce the damage. In conclusion, Risk management is a good practice tool to increase our capital and at the same time to reduce damage.

Initially \u00a0my \u00a0 choice \u00a0was to \u00a0focus on protecting \u00a0the \u00a0structures \u00a0more than \u00a0anything \u00a0and spending heavily on insurance. \u00a0 \u00a0However after repeated efforts \u00a0to \u00a0finish a level, the \u00a0fact that \u00a0got \u00a0highlighted was the importance \u00a0of \u00a0knowledge of the \u00a0inevitable \u00a0impending disaster. Seeing that \u00a0disaster could not be avoided came the realization and clarity,that first most \u00a0important \u00a0thing is to understand the \u00a0risk. , then \u00a0how to reduce the effect of the risk and \u00a0lastly \u00a0handling \u00a0the after \u00a0effects The rate at which the \u00a0damages \u00a0were \u00a0repaired \u00a0directly affected to the availability of more resources.This is \u00a0what \u00a0one should look into.Just like \u00a0in a simple \u00a0case of \u00a0spread of a disease.Faster \u00a0the recovery rate, faster the people get back to work \u00a0and lower the chances of the \u00a0country \u00a0suffering from \u00a0economic crises due to \u00a0lower productivity of the \u00a0population The cost in terms of insurance and protection \u00a0reduced \u00a0tremendously the moment \u00a0I understood the \u00a0point behind the research of the \u00a0comets. \u00a0Playing this \u00a0game over and over again was \u00a0a learning experience \u00a0and \u00a0the biggest lesson being \u00a0the trade off \u00a0between protection \u00a0against risk and preparedness. \u00a0It is better to be \u00a0prepared than \u00a0be over protected, The opportunity \u00a0cost \u00a0lost is more \u00a0when \u00a0you are over protected \u00a0than you are prepared. As one is more \u00a0prepared, \u00a0the impact of the disaster \u00a0gets lesser. The reason being that \u00a0as \u00a0development \u00a0takes place based on \u00a0 continuous research of the \u00a0comets, \u00a0one is able \u00a0to \u00a0build structures \u00a0that \u00a0can \u00a0withstand the effect and \u00a0hence lesser \u00a0expenses \u00a0in rebuilding. This \u00a0saving can be further \u00a0put \u00a0back into developing structures \u00a0which are \u00a0stronger. If i was to play \u00a0the \u00a0game again, \u00a0I would \u00a0pay more emphasis \u00a0to \u00a0first \u00a0get knowledge on the \u00a0impending \u00a0disaster, research and then look into \u00a0ways to mitigate the disaster. Natural disasters can neither be predicted nor be quantified. Depending on the \u00a0geography of the \u00a0place, economic and social systems \u00a0need to be put in \u00a0place \u00a0whereby the whole community works together. Knowledge of the topography \u00a0and \u00a0climate \u00a0conditions will help \u00a0as well. However one \u00a0point \u00a0after playing this \u00a0game that \u00a0comes \u00a0to \u00a0my \u00a0mind \u00a0is that knowledge cannot be \u00a0applied \u00a0if the general \u00a0level of \u00a0education is low. So \u00a0one way of protection is to spend on educating the people. \u00a0The \u00a0change \u00a0I would propose is some sort of warning systems, like a siren, when the comets \u00a0are visible. so \u00a0the \u00a0sense of sound can also \u00a0be used."}, "1708": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Excellent work!

The game had all the elements of risk management as it required preparation that included developing enough pods to generate revenue\nflows needed to purchase protection and insurance well in advance and also involved coping with consequences once the shocks materialized like community connectedness. In a risky world (in the game) where comets with differing severity and probability\nare frequent, in order to develop, risks need to be managed proactively, systematically and in an integrated manner. Mismanaged risks prove to be costly, but the measures required to prepare better, like a higher insurance plan, in the game, also come\ncostly. In the game, the need to be constantly prepared was very striking. However, by investing in the protection and insurance, the costs of coping were beneficial and the repairs even after the shocks materialized were cheaper thus making preparation\nbeneficial vis a vis coping in the game. This was an important trade off that needed assessment of the incoming risk and the decision to invest in protection plans. However, when the severity and the probability of the shocks were low, the investments\nin the protection and insurance plans decreased but as the uncertainty of the risks curtailed the certain costs. Thus risk management requires considering different risks and the relative need of preparing for each of them. Also, choices had to be made\nbetween purchase of a higher plan of insurance or a higher plan of upgrade of pods that also depended on the certainty and severity of the incoming shocks. Investing in a higher insurance plan, well in advance would be the thing to be done differently\nif played the second time. After the first time, we ensured that more resources are invested in upgrading the pods in which investments had already taken place as they fetched more returns. This in turn helped invest in better risk preparation. Also,\nafter some time, it was realized that when enough money is not available, time can be utilized to lift the land, as it does not involve huge amount and is progressive. The key learning from the game was that once shock materialized, the coping in terms\nof community connectedness had to be very swift and efficient. This highlights the importance of trained human capital and planning assets deployment in the coping phase. Also, the shocks come with a signal or an indicator. But calamities can take place\neven without notice like the rare but severe ones. In such cases full proof preparation might not help and coping efficiently is the only alternative. Insurance is not a full proof protection. It only helps reduce or limit the damage. Probability (chance\nif hit) is only an indicator and it is very hard to forecast shocks. Constant alertness and preparation and building from the beginning are some of the key learnings. Also development of a pod takes time. We have to plan in such a way that the development\nwork is done with advance preparation and hence the need to manage time, which is also an important resource in risk management. The costs of developing various pods are similar in the game. This is not true in real life situations. In actual situations,\neven choices have to be made in differing development plans based on costs and thus the priorities of development have to be set up accordingly. This element of differing development costs needs to be added in the game.\n"}, "1718": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "", "reflection": "0"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "2", "reflection": "0"}}, "reflection": "The risk horizon game gave me an well understanding based on risk management through meteors attack and defense.

The games also provides a simplified way of looking at risk management, which is in real world very complicated as actors do not make rational choices.  It would be interesting having to choose and make decisions in a more realistic settings, considering expenditures of jobs , education, health care etc. \n\nAs it is difficult to reach a higher level than level 3, and considering above comments I do not think it is fair to use the game results as part of the course grades.

I was mostly assured by the effect that protection has: it is an investment that you do in the beginning with a long term effect that is relevant also for future risks. The knowledge is only relevant for that particular risk and therefore less efficient.

In other words, the role of risk management here was to decrease the damage to Alora\u2019s development that a cometary impact could potentially have, thus safeguarding not only the process of development and progress but ultimately the survival of Alora itself. Risk management was intended here to either protect Alora\u2019s development entirely from the damage caused by a cometary attack or at least help it prepare for and cope more easily (that is, quickly and cost-effective) with the damages caused by the cometary impact so that Alora could recover quickly and cost-effectively from the negative shocks of a cometary impact and develop its society further. Following the logic of a virtuous circle, the more cost-effective the recovery (if any recovery was necessary at all), the more resources were available to invest both in further protective measures against future cometary impacts (thus indirectly safeguarding the development and survival of Alora) as well as in further direct societal development. There was a constant trade-off between allocating resources to direct development or allocating resources to instruments of risk management instead. While the priority was the development and survival of Alora, such development was only possible by protecting the community from and preparing the community for the repercussions of the cometary impacts. Another trade-off was between the various actions of preparation (ex ante risk management). The challenge was to balance appropriately between gaining knowledge (about the estimated severity and probability of actual impact) by virtue of research, protecting the community of Alora by raising the platform upon which the community was built (thus lowering the probability and size of a potential damage), and insuring the community from potential damages caused by the cometary impacts (by purchasing an insurance now to make a potentially necessary recovery less expensive in the future). Preparation for risk affected development at all times \u2013 while in the short-term resources potentially available for development were invested in risk management measures instead, in the long-term such investments proved not only to be highly cost-effective but to ultimately safeguard the further development and survival of Alora.\n\nWith each restart of the game I learned to better balance my allocation of resources between (1) risk management (indirect development) or direct development as well as between (2) research, protection, and insurance. Most importantly, I learned that research (even if its results are merely estimations rather than certainties) is a necessary prerequisite for more informed decisions about how to allocate your limited resources.\n\nLiving close to a river within an area that has become increasingly prone to floods, to better represent the risk management choices that my community faces I would change the initial negative shock in the Risk Horizon game from cometary impacts to rainfall.

The three key elements of risk management namely knowledge, protection and insurance formed the basis of any strategic decision making. It clearly demonstrated the difficulty of maintaining a balance between the three elements and on top of that the pressure of the need for further development. Seizing opportunities of cheap upgrades to the development was not always possible as more often than not, due to a lack of resources, development had to halt for the benefit of the highest possible insurance. So in return, once sufficiently insured one was almost lacking behind in development, played the other way around though meant  gaining a state-of-the-art development which was falling prey to the next shock and too expensive to rebuild without insurance. That said, even with insurance, if not enough importance had been placed on gaining knowledge, there was not enough time to tighten community structures in order to successfully rebuild the development. In other words, the aspect of coping after a shock played a vital role alongside knowledge gaining, protection building and securing insurance as well. I played the game a couple of times. At the beginning I focused on building as many different units as possible. This strategy worked fine in the first two levels but it became clear soon after that upgrades are desperately needed before they grew too expensive to shoulder. From then on I focused on a few units but upgraded them as soon as possible. Constant high insurance was another priority and making sure there were always enough resources to finance new insurance when needed (at the beginning of each new level) often meant not being able to develop further. The main thing I have learned is that although you might mean well, focusing on only one aspect of development has fatal effects. I you see each level as a term in office of a government you can understand how they would like to focus on building as much as they can as that is what is visible to the population, leaving future governments to invest in knowledge and insurance. Being short sighted is tempting but a balanced combination of gaining knowledge (of the nature of risks involved as well as its possible effects), protection (upgraded development structures, strong communities) and sufficient insurance is essential.\nAs I live in Europe, the resent developments in the Eurozone suggest that we are at a high risk of overspending. So if I could change one simple thing in the game, I would let contenders apply for credit that has to be paid back with interest at certain times. That way the temptation of building more than own resources permit is raised and the difficulty of letting \u201clater generations\u201d deal with repercussions of overspending is added to the resilience of the developments.\n"}, "1776": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "Student understands concept of Risk Management.

Firstly, preparation is key. It is always vital to research the factors of danger, which were comets in the game, as well as possible. Making sure to prepare using the information received from research can greatly aid one in preparing a solid and suitable contingency plan. However, research is not infallible, and original forecasts may be well off the mark. By the time you realize that the forecast is off, it may be too late to implement the necessary risk management policies. This occurred a few times in the game, where the severity of a comet may have been judged to be much lower than the actual severity. Unfortunately, I focused on short term gain (rapid development of the pods), rather than establishing a framework in which long term prosperity could be achieved. This event taught me the importance of insurance, where the costs in the event of a disaster are shared and this can prevent a large chunk of money from being suddenly spent. This approach definitely conserves more resources than a short-term one.\nAnother lesson was that preparation must also be made for low probability events, which may cause severe damage if neglected. One particular incident in the game brought my attention to this point: a comet with an almost filled damage bar had only 2 bars of \u201cchance to hit\u201d filled, but it hit Alora anyway. It caused severe damage and it was very difficult to get back on track. It would have been more frugal for me had I set better protection and invested in insurance. From this game, I learnt that while proactive risk management may cost a large sum in the present, it will set a solid framework for future development.\nFurther, I also found the approach to spread out developments to be more effective in beating the game. Perhaps this is also true for real life; spreading out developments prevents dualism from occurring in an economy, such as an advanced, rich manufacturing sector and a backwards, poor agricultural sector. As the old adage goes \u201cdon\u2019t put all your eggs in one basket\u201d. \nOne extra feature that could possibly improve the game is the implementation of more risks.

Risk, in this game, is a combination of likelihood of comets hitting the community and the severity of the consequence. In order to reduce the negative effect brought by the comets, the very first thing I did was to purchase the highest insurance coverage, which is 75%. Upgrading the pots was important because a community can be formed accordingly, and the power of community can be used to against the natural disasters. So whenever I had money after building a pot, I upgraded it. Trade-offs need to be made while performing risk management. Building as many pots as possible is good to the economy, but money needs to be saved on improve the bar of the silder. Spending time on research of the comets can help to increase time to build the community, reduce the severity of the comet hits and chances of comets hitting the ground, however, time needs to be alloted to increase the level of the slider to match with the severity level of the comet. Preparations of risk affect development either immediately, or after sometime. Community bonding acts immediately once a comet hits the ground. Damage can be spread over the whole community by clicking on the glow. Insurance was purchased beforehand in order to minimize possible damages happening in the future. Slider protection was prepared according to the status of the comet. It needed to be raised at least to the severity level of the comet damage. I played the game a couple times. The first time I tried, I didn't even pass level one. I realized that I didn't do enough research on the comets, instead, I continuously raised the slider way above the level needed to cover the comet damage. Money wasn't well spent and economy didn't get improve because of the lack of pots built in a community. Risk management is a balance act. In order to do well in risk management, one cannot focus on one apsect related to risk, but pay attention to all the factors and plan strategically and wisely. Time management is certainly important. Doing one thing ahead of another does make a difference. If I were to make some changes of the game, I would probably try to speed up the construction of pots, the faster pots are built, the faster they could be connected in a community to function together to avoid and reduce risk. I could probably use big data to find out which area has the highest probablity hit by the comet, thus upgrades of that pot could be taken as priority.

In order to ensure proper risk management I had to choose between building more communities so that each of the community members would act as each other\u2019s protector, or building a few communities and instead keeping more resources to protect against the risk of being hit and incurring losses, this involved . As I prepared for risk management, I engaged in research to understand the nature and strength of the comets that were coming. I also took on insurance to protect against any damages that would occur. However, I did not take enough insurance that would be commensurate with the level of damages that eventually occurred. I also engaged in reinforcing the structures already built instead of building more communities that would support each other in the event of a disaster, such as when the comets struck. \nIn this case, I played the game thrice. In the first case I lost. The reason being, I concentrated on research and insurance, and did little to develop the community. Here I ended up being hit and lost nearly 50% of developments. In the second and third attempts where I won both level one and level two, what I did differently was to balance between using resources to build communities and buying insurance. Whereas in the first case I bought insurance haphazardly, in the second and third trials, I ensured that the amount of insurance I bought was commensurate with the level of threat that was coming. In this way, I did not incur sever loses even when the comets hit. \nIn my place, the risks of either floods or drought are the most common. Therefore, the changes that would be relevant are twofold. First, the comets should be made to depict whether it\u2019s coming with dry winds and therefore drought or coming with lots of moisture and rain clouds, hence lots of rain and floods.

All Risk management is reflected in Risk Horizon through the three options of security through buying insurance on the damage caused by the comets, preparing for the risk before knowing it will happen by raising the platform, and coping with risk by conducting research on the comets as they are falling to improve the chances of having no damage. Preparation for risk using any of the three methods had the opportunity cost of not being able to spend the money used on protection for development or new construction, and even though research was free, while the research window was open no other game actions could be completed and therefore development was slowed in the short term by managing risk.

Alongside\nbuilding and upgrading the pods that would increase the rate of development,\nrepresented by the development bar on the left, there was a need to watch out\nfor comets that were what we call shocks in reality. This accounts for\nobstacles and constraints that stand in the way of responsible and effective\nrisk management, and tackling them. In an attempt to keep a balance between\ndevelopment and preparing for risks, I had to distinguish between three\ndifferent risk management activities; research, also known as knowledge in\nreality, protection and insurance. Using the power of research by keeping the\ncomet\u2019s box focused on the screen for as long as I could, I acquired as much\nknowledge as I could about the approaching comet (shock), assessing its\nseverity and chances of hit. In the first few attempts of the game I would\nspend only a two or three bars on research, however after a couple of tries, I\nrealised prolonging the time spent on research had a positive effect, reducing\nthe impact on the pods as I attained more time to connect to communities just\nbefore the comet would hit. However, the challenge I faced was that the more\ntime I spent on research, the more I was compromising on the time that could be\nspent on protection. Although in the first few tries of the game, I did spend\nrelatively more time on protection, in the latter few tries, I spent more time\non research as mentioned above. Given a number of insurance plans to choose\nfrom, what I had to consider was the amount of resources available at hand.\nTorn between choosing an effective insurance plan and protection that was\ndraining resources, I would choose to employ the insurance plan that may have\nbeen the most expensive at times but in the long-term it turned out to be the\ncorrect decision, as it reduced the cost of repairs for the damage caused by\nthe comets. This signifies the importance of long-term planning. At times, due\nto shortage of resources, I had to choose the cheapest insurance plan in the\nbeginning, but as I gained resources by developing and upgrading the pods, I\nwould change my insurance plan to a new and improved one. And on the other\nhand, at times due to a huge chunk of my resources being spent on the insurance\nplan, there was a lack of resources, limiting my ability to upgrade the pods,\nthus slowing the pace of development of the community. I learned that risk\npreparation is highly correlated with income, and most importantly there is a need\nof careful planning and management to balance the time and resources available\nin a framework of obstacles, by thinking more strategically about the return\nover a long period of time. Moreover, to better represent the risk management\nchoices that matter, I would propose to add another aspect of risk management\nthat deals with a positive change such as technological improvement or a\nresource boom, and an indication of how to take advantage of it, clearly indicating\nthe significance of developing upon new opportunities alongside threats. \u00a0"}, "1844": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "This reflection is very enthusiastic ", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "This reflection is very enthusiastic ", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "Risk management was so useful in this game for me.

Some people may be vulnerable\u2014that is, especially susceptible to losses from negative shocks\u2014as a result of their exposure, internal conditions, and risk management.\n\n Second Lesson : Risk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the ability to cope once a risk has materialized. Preparation (or ex ante risk management) includes a combination of three actions that can be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge, obtaining protection, and obtaining insurance.This is what is known as the interlinked components of risk management.\n\nThird Lesson: Protection and insurance can provide complementary means of managing risk\nProtection can decrease the likelihood of very severe losses, thereby increasing the probabi-lity of routine losses relative to extraordinary losses. \n\nFourth lesson :\nRisk management is cost-effective\u2014yet not always feasible Not only can risk management save lives, avert damages, and unleash opportunities, but preparation for risk often has high returns. \n \nIf I were to play this game a second time, I will first focus on three main things. First knowledge of the type of risk ; then preparation in order to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits ; and finally I will insist on insurance so as to face  potential outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty.\nWhat change would I propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live?

It also provoked an assessment of the  trade-offs to be taken when making decisions regarding risk management \u2013 especially in cases when resources are constrained. For example \u2013 does one invest in infrastructure (housing/ pods or broad protection) or does one invest in insurance? The game also made me choose between investing precious time in research or spending time in other activities such as building/ development, buying insurance or developing protection.\n\nThe more prepared I was for an event \u2013 through research, protection and by having insurance \u2013 the better I withstood the events. The community links were stronger and I was able to build on the community links after an event. This, together with insurance meant that the damage I sustained was much less when hit by a severe meteor. It also cost less to invest in broad societal protection, low insurance and research (which 'cost time') than paying for high insurance. I was finally able to advance higher in the game when I paid less for higher insurance and put more money into development (by spending more on pods) and by increasing protection for society (to prevent the negative event). The rewards or benefits were higher for reducing risk for society as a whole and developing it than for trying to deal with the consequences of a negative event. \n\nI did better when I had a higher level of development. Income was higher when I had more pods and when I had invested more in the pods. This generated more income for me and society prospered.\n\nI was able to gain more time to build community connections after I was struck by an event when I had spent more time researching an event. When I had more time building community connections after being struck by a negative event, the damage was often less severe. This was not only beneficial in terms of sustaining less damage, but it also helped in that I was able to focus on developing my island and preparing for other negative shocks.\n\nA lesson I learned was that the solution is not found in any one component, and that trade-offs are constantly being made in a changing context and under time constraints. This means that risk management practitioners have to be constantly analysing risks and opportunities, as well as changing obstacles to addressing or acting upon those risks and opportunities.\n\nI had played the game a few times and I tried a number of strategies to ensure success. However, I found that the game, like life, is somewhat unpredictable. I did find increased success with more development, research and more community connections. The game also highlighted the obstacles facing risk management. For example, time pressure made it more difficult to choose and undertake activities. \n\nIf I had to change on thing in the game to better capture one thing that captures risk management where I live, I would add a component to differentiate according to class and gender. Where I live, poor people and women are significantly worse affected by risk shocks than rich people and they take longer to recover. The game could demonstrate this by, for example, showing some pods being worse affected than others and taking a longer period to rebuild. Pods could also be different colours to show different genders."}, "1914": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "The need for insurance and the trade-off necessary to manage risk.", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "The Opportunity Game,\nAs a new colonist on Alora we had to build a new world facing several challenges. The task is simple, build a new prosper community facing crisis that occur on the horizon. These crises have a certain possibility of occurrence and we can tackle them to an extend by learning from the past crises and preparing for the new ones. The goal was to achieve development by taking the necessary risks and preparing for the crisis. So instead of ad-hoc measures, when it became clear that a meteor will hit the colonists applied a standard risk management plan. To achieve this we started to produce wealth to be able to grow and to prepare, there was a federal reserve of couple of hundred points to be able to invest-insure-repair if necessary. After the first hit, although we had a good insurance it was clear that only with insurance it not going to work so the \u201cearly observation\u201d  plan was implemented. As a meteor-crisis appeared on the horizon it entered under evaluation in terms of chances of hit and the severity of the impact and speed. Depending of the 3 combined characteristics different risk management options have been implemented, combining the tools of insurance with research, insurance with protection or in the cases of systemic risk which could have send us back in the stone ages of Alora insurance-research and protection combined was used. These preparations where needed to be done in a way not to hinder development. By insurance coping was much easier, lower loss of development and lower cost of repairs. By investing in research some crisis where tackled without any losses. \nAfter the first attempt to settle, the policy of investing in insurance and research was changed. It was a shift from investment to early insurance, but less effective to buying insurance later on but with higher coverage of the risks. We the colonists learned that only by insurance we are not going to survive so we started to invest in research to, as it became very cost effective. Investment in protection was possible after reaching a level of development, protection made it possible to resist to high severity crisis or at least to reduce the impact of it.\nFor Risk Horizon 2.0 to develop Alora I would implement a different way of approach of the consequences of a hit by meteor. Meaning that now the pods are affected in the same way by hit, I would implement a different scale of damage and price to build depending how close or far are from the shore. This would mean that there is a global policy regarding the early warning system, but different policies regarding where to build, where to upgrade the pods and how much to pay for insurance.

The role of risk management made clear that if you don't protect yourself through gaining knowledge of the chance and the severity of the comet hitting, your work on developing your buildings will suffer proportionally to the missing knowledge, protection and insurance. Of course, you can't always have all you want. That's why your rate of development decreases for a period of time, in order to pay for the insurance (I usually bought the insurance at the beginning of the game. 2nd level - 25%, 3rd level -50%, 4-5 - 75%), and increasing your protection. But the outcomes of such a temporary loss are greater than their neglecting. I can't compare the superiority of either insurance or protection, since I played only 1 game; but I can say that for me, insurance was on the second plan, even though I bought it first. I didn't want to risk the huge damage a severe comet would cause for developing 1 or 2 building. I'm sure it would've cost me much more in the end. And so, I put my emphasis on protection. Even though it diminishes your rate of development, when a comet hits, the damage done is less than without protection, or even none, and the money difference from a 50% and 5% can then be reinvested in developing your buildings, buying better insurance, and/or improving your current level of protection. I guess the incentive to get through as many levels as you can, pushes you to risk in favour of the development. I thought of strategising my actions as follow. As long as a comet didn't have a 40+ chance of hitting and severeness of 3 bars, I continued developing, knowing that my insurance and protection are more than enough to have no damage, or subsequently very little reparation. But if the comet had a very high level of severeness, even with a small chance of hitting, I worked on protection, knowing that even if it doesn't hit now, so I will be both prepared in advance and having the opportunity to develop the building without losing anything when the next one came. I can therefore say that thinking ahead and rationalising that the cost you pay now, will save you more than 100% of the money invested plays a key role on how people approach risk management."}, "1929": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "From your writing follows that you put a lot of effort and time into thinking about the optimal strategy to follow in the game.

The environment already has a natural disaster issue, those being comets that an sometimes be very severe. While they can miss the pods they can also cause a great deal of damage with both direct contact and after shocks. Since there was already a high risk which could not be controlled the pods insurance was of utmost importance. Insurance offered immediate results. If I was to play the game only one time I would make sure that there were many basic pods with as much insurance as I could afford. With each time I played the game I improved on both placement and improvement of pods. By placing pods a little further apart and improving certain pods and not others I was able to minimize the cost of damage when a comet hit. Each time I played the game I learnt the value of vantage points. As you learn more about potential risks you get a different vantage point which allows you to assess risk better. With each failure you have more information to better protect yourself in the future. I learnt the value of implementing research with each comet, preparing for the severity and likelihood of that comet hitting the pods and causing damage. I also learnt the value of repairing the damage as quickly as possible. I was able to ignore low risk comets and keep investing in strengthening the infrastructure of my buildings but at the same time get into high gear using reserves to add more protection for comets with a higher probability of hitting the pods and causing damage. While improvement was important after the pods were built it was also important to have enough money to insurance protection as research on comets indicated a higher probability of hitting the pods and causing damage. I would add the feature of walls and placement of the pods. This will allow stronger protection and also placement that may prevent all the pods from getting damaged when one was hit. Flooding would be an immediate problem in the place that I live. Given the fact that global temperatures have changed in recent years and there is a lot more rainfall in my area it would be wiser to prepare for flooding of homes. I would propose that research is done on adequate drainage in the area which will allow collected water and heavy rainfall to be funneled away from homes.

Since development cost money it was necessary for one to\ndistribute the available amount between the development investment and either\nrising the living space to save the house from floods or researching the\nincoming threats. The main focus was for me to develop the houses to meet the\nlevel goals. Because of this I started and build only a few settlements in the\nbeginning to see how costly their upgrades would be. After this I started to\nresearch the meteoroids, focusing on the once with the higher damage and/or hit\nthreat. Furthermore it was important for me to make sure my houses were at least\ninsured to a rate of 50%. Even though I did this in every level, I only needed\nthe insurance\u2019s help in the first round, since I waited with rising the living\narea until the second stage. I have the feeling, that it was very important to\nhave the financial security the insurance offered me and paid me back 50% of\nthe damaged. This gave me the opportunity to invest more money in the buildings\nand in particular in research. \u00a0After\nhaving played the game I realize that rising the living area above ground is a measure\nto safe the settlement in last second but at the same time comes at a high\ncost. The cultural development is stalled for the moment and money is lost in\nthe process. After a while it became more important for me to focus on research\nand leveling the buildings, though I did not follow this insight enough in my\nlast round and sacrificed too much of my money and even more of my development\non rising the ground, which lead to failing the round\u2019s goal within the set\ntime limit. The most (cost-) effective measure really was to do proper research\non the relevant threats. This way I could avoid most damages to my houses just\nbe being reasonably prepared. Concluding from these experiences and since I\nplayed the game only once I would definitely only rise the ground/protection in\nthe first and second round.

It gave us the chance to develop a community in a sustainable manner. Risk Management in the game was about maintaining the right balance among knowledge, protection, and insurance \u2013 the tools of risk management. The tools had to be applied depending upon the nature of the threat, ranged from mild to severe. It built community\u2019s resilience, thereby reducing the effects of adverse events, and provided them an opportunity for development. The communities faced and coped with risks for a fixed duration, making the time management for each and every action extremely crucial.  \nThe choices that were needed to make during the course of the game were dependent on many factors including severity, current level of protection, and probable time with which the comet was supposed to hit the ground, while making sure that the progress of the development of the community was being met with in the allotted time to reach the next level. Therefore, how much amount of which activity needed to be done at what time was critical to ensure the development of the community. There were certain trade-offs that needed to be maintained among knowledge, protection, and insurance so that the task of developing and protecting a community does not seems to be elusive. Knowledge of the comet helped to know about the nature of the threat and the likelihood of the risk, thereby reducing uncertainty. Protection, another tool of risk management, aided in mitigating and sometimes in thwarting the adverse shocks. Insurance on the other hand certainly gave us a cushion to come back easily from the negative shocks, comets in our case, and ensured that growth of the community kept on increasing despite a setback. Now, the trick was managing the use of all these tools in such a way that would foster development in spite of certain hiccups. Protection, for instance, sometimes had to be avoided if the multiple severe comets were coming in which the possibility of serious damage is pretty high, then you would made a trade-off between knowledge and protection, especially when it is taking too much time to raise your protection level, leaving you with little time for other things. One of the main takeaways from the game is that to address any calamity successfully, it is indispensible to shift from ad hoc approaches to planned and pro-active approaches. It is imperative to be cognizant of the negative shocks, giving you the time to build community relations, but effects of those relations will largely remain transitory if they are not backed with a decent level of protection. \nFinally, had I been given a chance to add one more thing, it would be risk taking ability of the community itself that could very well be turned into an opportunity for development."}, "2012": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "the reflection of game is described but you should write better and clearer related to role of risk management and the role of each components in game, Thanks", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "Question\nOne:"}, "2013": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "Very good reflection of the game\nThe reflection lacks flow, you start about the game, mix it in with the real life scenario and there is no apparent conclusion.", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "Very good reflection of the game\nThe reflection lacks flow, you start about the game, mix it in with the real life scenario and there is no apparent conclusion.", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "\u00a0"}, "2014": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "", "reflection": "1"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "2", "reflection": "1"}}, "reflection": "Reflections about the Game"}, "2015": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "This learner didn`t answer all the question, besides , the essey just 219 words. he/she didn`t gave us much reflection about how he/she palyed the game", "reflection": "0"}, "1": {"clarity": "0", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "This learner didn`t answer all the question, besides , the essey just 219 words. he/she didn`t gave us much reflection about how he/she palyed the game", "reflection": "0"}}, "reflection": "Risk management\nis the identification, assessment, and prioritization of "}, "2016": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "It is very good, very complete", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "It is very good, very complete", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "Reflections about the Game"}, "2017": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "Key strength of the reflection is that all the questions are addressed.\nInsurance doesn't minimize the chances of being hit.

So, risk management involved a combination of prevention of such disasters and coping from the after effects. To save the community, I focused on doing a lot of research on the comets to understand their nature of causing devastation and accordingly took protection measures (alleviating the land to save the pods) and availing insurance as an incentive to re-build the destroyed pods at a cheaper price. The trade offs I faced while playing the game was that even if I did a lot of research on the falling comets to be alert and took protective steps to alleviate the land to save the pods, even then there was destruction. Also, insurance wasn't sufficient to repair the pods, it being expensive (as most of the money I spent on researching the comets, building pods and alleviating land for saving the pods from getting destroyed). Preparation for risk did impact development of the community as focus was shifted to building shock resilient pods which could withstand the natural calamity. Lot of resources were channelized in preventing the effects of the comets by undertaking research, protection and insurance. The resources foregone in preventing loss did slow down development initially but with time, a balance was achieved between minimizing the impact of the external environment (loss caused to the community due to falling comets) and boosting the resilience of the internal environment by building up the upgraded pods. \u00a0"}, "2044": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "2", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n"}, "2045": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "", "reflection": "2"}, "1": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "2", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "\n\n"}, "2046": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "I like that you talk about balance.

Then, I wanted to protect the community to mitigate the damage if some \u00a0comet hit the surface. The last tool was about knowledge.

In short, my strategy was trying to combine those ex-ante tools in a way that I would be sure that the community would not suffer from a shock, so it will keep on growing and developing to it\u2019s fullest capacity and reach the highest score.

The different choices that had to be made to achieve this were to raise the island (protection), research the comets approaching so as to minimize severity of their damage (knowledge), or purchase insurance to minimize the amount damage and repair costs when they hit. Raising the island cost money and time, and put development on hold; researching the comets was time-consuming and often took time away from planning or advancing pods; and purchasing insurance cost a significant amount of money that could have been put towards development. All three had an immediate effect in terms of their cost but a later, and usually larger, effect in terms of benefit or pay-off. In regards to choices, only one of the three could be pursued at a time, and the order in which they were pursued greatly impacted development and the player\u2019s success in advancing to the next level. For example, in some levels it would have been possible to raise the island while you were still approaching the development goal, while in most levels it was only wise to do so after you reached your development goal and had extra savings/green to spare in case a comet hit and damaged your pods. Another choice that often had to be made was level of insurance - if a comet was approaching and likely to hit and damage your island, yet you could only afford the first level of insurance, it was best to purchase it but if you later wanted to upgrade to the highest level, you had to pay the full amount of the highest level, rather than the difference between the level you already had and the new one you were purchasing. Having played the game more than once, the first few times I assumed the best form of risk management would be to raise the island so as to prevent comets from hitting and damaging Alora at all. I didn\u2019t realize how much it cost or how likely some comets were to hit and so I never advanced past the second or third level. After the first few times, the game became more stressful as I learned to appropriately balance the amount of time and money I spent on each of the three resources. Oftentimes, I learned that it would be wisest to purchase insurance first then research the closest comet as much as possible and make sure my developments were in green before I attempted to raise the island - there were a few times when I didn\u2019t even get to raise the island at all during the level.This really helped me understand the concept and possible disadvantages of behavioral biases. If I could change one simple thing about the game, it would be the community connections part. I would make it so it would not only be tied to research, but was instead a general part of the game also somehow tied to protection and insurance. Also, I would try to make it so that it is not all or nothing - for example, I would vary the damage so that not all pods/communities are damaged completely or at all.

By investing in the community development, which in turn increased the economic return, one had to an also invests in protection to reduce the propensity of a crisis, by avoiding negative impacts from the shock (the Asteroid hitting Earth). Whenever time was not enough to cover building protection, then insurance was a wise investment, which could reduce the amount needed to cover the damages, thus allowing you to keep developing at a constant speed, instead of spending large amounts in repair. Preparing for risk as investing on protection took some time and resources away from investment in development. Preparation was in the end the best type of investment to avoid the risk not only in response to the direct threat. It had to be done ahead of time, as sometimes a high-risk of impact and highly damaging meteor could come very fast. Therefore preparation ahead of time was necessary and it was the biggest differential factor, more than insurance, \n\n2.\tI played the game several times and once I realized that the trick was to invest in protection to avoid damages from meteors, I did not spend any resources on insurance and had more available to further the development and upgrading of the community. I learned that time is precious when you invest in protection, you do not have the time to invest in the development of the community. One has to choose carefully where the community needs the most support according to the needs, imediate and future Balancing the amount invested in insurance, development and protection was the trick to reach the fifth level of the game. Research also helped, but whenever the development was being accomplished, in accordance to time. Whenever the minimum time limit was on red, meaning development was not taking place as it should, barely any efforts were given to research, a  commonly found in real life as well.WHen I was in Level 5, I was doing very well with a fully functioning upgraded community, but realized to late the protection from the asterois and tidal waves had gone down after a few minor hits and  a highly damaging Asteroid came.

However, I do work with Africa a lot in wastewater treatment and reuse as fertigation for areas with lack of rain and groundwater. I would like to see a game like this in respect to the effect that rainfall insurance cause in India though. I am not entirely clear on how it works. The fact that farmers can pay the insurance when there are crops producing is understandable. However, if it does not rain, and the farmer does not have any product to sell, how could he have had afforded the insurance in the first place? Therefore, I would substitute the pods for crops and the asterois for droughts to see how this system is working.  Is it true that farmers only get their security insurance payments in case of no rain and he has produced no crops?

It was also important to have enough money resources to allocate to \"development\" in order to meet overall objectives there within the given timeframe.\n\nIn addition, there were choices about how much to invest in each type of protection based on the precise threat encountered. Given that not all potential threats were realised, one needed to consider not just the size of the threat, but also in the potential for it to actually happen, as well as exactly when it might occur. As such, risk management choices paid off in different ways: \"protection\" mitigated damage against all threats in a general sense over time (but was relatively expensive), \"research\" increased capacity to deal with specific and immediate threats as they happened, and \"insurance\" offered a general way of dealing with the aftermath of a disaster.\n\nI played the game several times, and learned to manage risks better each time.

It firstly involved the pursuit of opportunity. This was done in the form of building and upgrading the pods on the planet. Secondly, it involved preparing for risks by acquiring knowledge about the comets, purchasing insurance and increasing the level of protection. Lastly, it showed how to cope with the effects of risks by repairing the damaged pods and receiving the benefits of attaining knowledge, purchasing insurance and ensuring protection. It gives a great insight into the process of risk management and its components. And gives players practice in risk management. The challenge in this game was to attain a balance. This refers to the balance between knowledge, protection and insurance. The time constraint sometimes limited the amount of knowledge that could have been obtained and if sufficient knowledge was obtained, it limited the amount of time available to allocate resources sufficiently between insurance and protection. The budgetary constraint resulted in a trade-off between protection and the pursuit of opportunity by the upgrading and building of pods. However, by preparing for risk, the effects of the comets were significantly reduced which made coping with its effects easier. By increasing protection, the percentage of damage caused decreased and by purchasing insurance, the amount of money needed to repair the pods was lower.\nIf I do attempt to play the game again, I would spend more time and money upgrading and purchasing pods. I believe the amount of time I spent preparing for risk sometimes hindered my pursuit of opportunity. Seeing that pursuing opportunity and coping are the definition of risk management, my strategy faltered in that area.  However, many lessons were learnt from this game. Firstly, it is good to pursue opportunity as long as you are well prepared for the risks that may be faced. Also, in preparing for risks, there must be a good balance between knowledge (understanding the severity and possibility of the comet hitting), insurance (attaining help to cushion the damage done to the pods) and protection (raising the level of the ground to lessen the effect of the wave caused by the comets) in order to cope with the effects of the risks faced. Knowledge must be the first element to be obtained. After this is done, the decision to allocate resources (those resources being time and money) would be done more efficiently between protection and insurance.  \nIf I was given the task of changing one thing to this game, I would include a risk return trade off. That is, I would show that in order to achieve a high return, one makes themselves vulnerable to a higher level of risk. This is evident in many countries particularly through the financial system. In my country, Trinidad and Tobago, oil and gas is our major source of GDP. The oil and gas sector is a very volatile and risky sector given that oil and gas prices are volatile. However, it produces very large returns which provide the main source of income for my country. Therefore to add to this game, I would give the option of building conservative, moderate or aggressive pods. The conservative pods would be cheaper to build, give a very small return (very small increases to development bar) and cause less damaging comets to attack. Whereas, the aggressive pods would give a very large return (large increase to development bar), be more expensive to build and cause more damaging comets to attack. Conservative pods would lie in the middle. Thus, players will be more aware of the challenges faced in pursuing opportunity."}, "2160": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "2", "comprehension": "2", "comments": "The Risk Horizon game appeared to be very simple.", "reflection": "2"}}, "reflection": "The Risk Horizon game appeared to be very simple until I started\nto get in to it after a couple of minutes.

I realised upgrading was the key to success, also,\nnotwithstanding; obtaining the insurance and topping up the protection. The preparation\nfor risk immediately aided me financially to purchase/upgrade the pods and\nit also aided with the time constraint, and I soon realised that upgrading the infrastructure\nis what really got you ahead in terms of progress and development. I also\nrealised upgrading existing pods, was slightly more important than just setting\nup new pods in large numbers, and not upgrading them. I maintained medium to high protection at all times while choosing a suitable insurance package. I also concluded that after some time my risk\nanalysis skills improved due to practice. This would be due to the\nknowledge of the game after several levels. With knowledge and strategy, I was able to progress through the game. I realise the purpose of the\ngame was also to perform under time constraints, while assessing and dealing\nwith risk thrown at me. I ended up playing the game more than once; therefore I\nwas able to move faster with regard to networking the community when disaster\nstruck, also analysing the severity factor and prioritising how I dealt with threats.\nThe main thing I learnt from the game is coping, multi-tasking and effective risk\nanalysis while maintaining financial stability.

During the game you learn how to prepare in face of a possible disaster and how to face the effects when the event occurs. What makes the experience unique is that in this process the game asks you to combine decisions in different but interconnected levels such as development, economic, knowledge, insurance and protection \n\nAs lesson learned, for example, in terms of protection you prove that it is important to make an effort to know the probability of occurrence of the event and also to measure the possible consequences. By doing this research it is possible to undertake protection measures that will reduce the impacts in case of a disaster.\n\nThe insurance is also pointed out during the game and shows that the more developments you have the more you have to pay for the insurance. This fact demonstrate that even is the cost of insurance is high it is a necessary action in order to avoid disasters affect the path to development. \n\nThe role of community is clear in the game because when a disaster occurs teamwork is key to reduce the impact in the society. \n\nSince I played the game only once what I would change if I play it again would be to be able to make more balanced decisions in terms of building new constructions and spending money in preparation. This because I think that may be I constructed new buildings too fast not always assuring its safety. \n\nFinally, I would only change a small thing about the game. My propose is to add a different kind of risk to the game so as you go truth the levels you have to take management decisions in a situation where you not only have to prepare and protect from a natural disaster because you also have to face with additional risk such as a financial crisis situation, or a technological disaster due to natural disaster such as in the case of Fukushima Disaster in Japan. \n\nI think this change  should be interesting since you can take more integral decisions in face of complex context that are more like the reality that we face in countries like Colombia. \n"}, "2166": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "0", "comments": "I am sorry you lacked the experience.

Also, it required a strategy, planning and implementing decisions so as to develop the village fully. In addition, risk management helps the community to grow while being cushioned against risks and if the risks occurred, then it would help in minimizing losses.  \nTo make a good decision, I had to consciously plan to monitor the environment, assess the risks and take corresponding action. After citing a comet, had to analyze possibility of occurrence and if it did occur, then what would the severity be. The speed at which I took actions to some extent contributed to whether I would be caught up and hit badly, lots of losses or I would be ready for any eventuality.\nI also noted having immediate savings helped me to minimize damage. In addition, formal insurance helped me to rebuild destroyed pods and at a cheaper cost. \nIt was necessary to balance all the aspects, as the severity in the comet increased, so did the damage if it hit the pods. As my risk increased, I also found it necessary to buy higher amount of insurance because savings alone would not help much.\n\nAs I prepared for risks, development slowed down but because I had to do research and also take protective actions. Later on it was easier to develop because I had taken necessary protection measures. I now had time and less worry about risks. This is because I was constantly aware of what eminent risk and potential losses and ways to mitigate as well as cope.\n\n2. Learning\nI learnt that it is important to carry out research constantly so that you can gauge the elements you are exposed to vis a vis potential damage in the event of occurrence and take the necessary decision on whether to protect or to insure. Saving was also important in reducing the damage. The higher the safer it is to, in addition to protection, transferring the risk through insurance. \n\n3.

Having paid for insurance meant I paid less to repair my pods and did not lose too much value on the pods.\n\nIn terms of a change that I would make; instead of the meteors hitting, I would have the lack of health care plans or health insurance as the possible hit.

If a comet did hit the ground,another goal was to learn how to cope with its effects by recovering from loss using the same elements. Some of the trade-offs I had to face were,for instance,giving up a higher insurance coverage in exchange for more protection and more resources to build new pods,or having to build less in order to be able to afford their insurances when they evolved since they became more expensive. Go as a consequence of these trade-offs,this led me to make some choices which had to do with reaching a balance between the deployment of knowledge,insurance and protection,thus making sure these elements were obstacles . Development was affected by preparation for risk in times when severe comets with high chance of hit come closer to the ground ,thus forcing me to spend great amounts of financial resources on preparation which did not allow me to achieve a continuos development. However,this was an effective decision since costs of preparation ended up being lower than costs of coping. After playing the game several times, I learned that the finest way to manage risk while encouraging development is by identifying the resources the resources you have and how they may help you to mitigate risk,making an even and moderate use of them,implementing development actions gradually but strongly,thinking strategically and learning from experience to become more resilient every time towards the effects of risk. In contrast to this game was to focus right straight into development without taking enough time to analyze how to manage preparation so that development would not be hindered.

When the comets appear, base on level of severity, and chance of hit I'll decide to make research more or less the levels. To prepare for risk of comets, gathering knowledge (research) is the most important, next is protection and insurance is last. Knowledge can tell you what you should do first, which is important and how you can do. For example, if severity or chance of hit is hight, or both of them, you have to do Protections rapidly first, at least same equal level with them, then make research the more the better. An advantage of this game is that you can research comets, upgrade the current pods and build more pod in same time. So, if you have money and time enough, try to do all the actions quickly. It helps your community has both protection and upgrading, this is the key of development of Alora. And if the threaten of comets is low you, maybe, just focus  on upgrading, building and protection.

To have a better represent in risk management in my country, the important thing is to change Cognitive and Biases of behavior. For example, people used to open hot water 24/24, do not unplug power, run the washing machine with too few clothes, use the freezer temperature too low.. they think this is normal, so do not waste electricity much. But if other 80 million people thought so too, the power consumed is not a small number while the country still lack regular electricity. Another example the habit of using plastic bags. Since the advent of plastic bags it proved very good its usability. However, its impact on the environment and health are huge but almost none of us noticed. Plastic bags harm from production because the production of plastic bags to use as raw material in the oil and gas, and other additives are substances extremely hazardous to health and environment human. When released to the environment plastic bags break down into smaller molecules of plastic, toxic and eventually contaminate soil and water. According to a survey by environmental agencies, the use of plastic bags bluff seems difficult to quit the habit of Vietnam. As environmental sector, investment demand for environmental protection in Vietnam is 85.000 billion dongs. Of the above, there are hundreds of billions being used to overcome the damage caused by plastic containers, plastic bags of waste into the environment.

Then I spent on buildings, and last (but not least...)\u00a0on research. The best trade-off I could observe was that highest insurance brought less damage and lower costs of recovery.

Resources have to be allocated to these needs accordingly. \n    The biggest challenge of this game is ensuring that rapid economic development is taking place while making adequate allocations for those measures which protects the subsequently created pods (infrastructure) from comets (natural disasters). Therefore sufficient allocation must be made for both ex-ante measures (protection by increasing the elevation of the settlement, insurance and research regarding the potential effects of a possible impact) and ex-post measures (coping) such as reconstruction of the pods damaged by the natural calamity. The need for the ex-ante measures is pressing as the threat from comets is perennial. Therefore procrastination with regard to these disaster management measures is suicidal. \n    The greater the economic development (read as number of pods), the greater will be the potential hit from a natural calamity. Therefore the policymaker (player) has to ensure a certain degree of proportionality between the expenditure on economic development and that pertaining to risk management.\n     In terms of choosing between the various options which are available with respect to risk management measures, I found insurance to be the most important one and, therefore, my first action in any level was to take the highest level of insurance possible. I found that the benefits of the same far outweighed the cost incurred in taking it as damage was certain at every level and the cost of rebuilding the pods would be the same as that incurred in the original reconstruction of the pods if insurance was not taken. Also the pattern of comet impacts was such that one was certain to happen at the very end of the level and this event\u2019s impact would almost always be massive. Without insurance, it is very likely that one will have neither the resources nor the time to reconstruct all the pods and hit to the development bar, in this scenario, is a big one and one cannot make a recovery sufficient enough to make it to the next round given the paucity of time after it. \n     I would rank insurance, protection and knowledge in that order in my preferences in this game. In a real life scenario, I think knowledge would precede protection in terms of importance primarily because knowledge is protection when knowledge is defined in broader terms and helps find ways to protect oneself. I played the game multiple times and I found speed of action as something that needed improvement on my side and this is what I focused at each successive attempt. I also increased the amount of research I did as it was a neglected area in my initial attempts. I found that I did not need to panic at the sight of every comet. This helped me better focus on economic development. This tells me that knowledge about potential risks and calamities helps me to focus on my strengths better. \n     I thought the game was one dimensional in terms of the source of risk. I think adding at least one more potential disaster would balance the game better and more aligned to reality. The disaster I propose is earthquake.

It was in fact it was a challenging experience to learn how risk management is important for one\u2019s healthy development through this game. The tutorial given for assistance helped to learn about the game more in deep. Being the luminator of Alora, my task of developing this community by meeting certain milestones in the ways was really hard and thought provoking.\nBefore considering ever building the pods we certainly need to ensure adequate measures like sufficient amount of cash is there with us. It was necessary throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time available to make sure this risk protection was limited.\nAlora falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.\nThe power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.\nBy undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage.\nPlaying the game for the first time you will certainly find it difficult to access the amount of risk involved and possible consequences of it you may have to face if hit by the unforeseen factors, But given a chance to play again you will certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damage based on previous experiences.\nMain things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different ways to manage risk etc.\nIf given a chance to develop a new version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups within the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each members with the group financially in times of need. They could also take up a group insurance policy to anticipate and manage their risk.

There were many obstacles in achieving the goal at each level. Comets\nwere the destructing element in the game. Escaping from such destruction was an\nimportant task in the game. Basically, the game aimed in protecting the pods,\nwhich are the households. Risk management helps in protecting the pods from\nbeing destructed by comets. At the same time it is necessary to make sure that\nthe currency also does not come down and ensure that the meter is in green\ncolor. Firstly, in the first level, i created 4 pods. As the pods were created, i started upgrading each pod. So as to develop the area. And also i made sure that protection is given to the pods. Protection given to the pods depends on the severity and chances of hits. If the severity and chances of hit is more, then the protection should also be increased to match it. But the challenge is that as the protection increases the meter turns to red and yellow. Also, the currency reduces as the protection increases. Insurance is also provided as three packages in different rates that is 25%, 50%,and 75%. We can choose whichever package we want. Insurance to be selected also depends on the currency the player is holding. The rates of package also depends on percent of losses covered. Depending on the currency held by the player the package can be selected and to that extent the currency gets reduced. The pods can be upgraded alternatively.\u00a0Up gradation\u00a0also requires currency. If the money required is there, then the pods can be upgraded. the main thing to be noted is that, if the comets hit the pods, it should be immediately recovered. All of these steps are to undertaken within the stipulated time. And within this time, the meter should turn to green, which means\u00a0favorable. Also only if this is achieved, that level is won and one can move to next\u00a0level. Managing all these tasks at the same time is the real challenge faced by the player. The player should see to that, the currency is increased, the pods are protected and the meter to be turned to green color. In order to manage this risk i tried upgrading the pods as soon as possible, so that it earns currency, also the meter also changes its color. Definitely, i played the game more than once. The next time when i started playing, i made sure first the protection is increased to the level of severity and chances of hit. Then, also I kept on upgrading the pods continuously. By playing this game, I learnt that as the game progresses, the risk also increases. Likewise, to develop and to protect a community, it is important to manage different aspects. As there is more development, the risk involved also increases. Therefore, timely protection and insurance to be given when required. Also, we should be able to recover when we incur losses. proper attention is required to complete this task. Dedication towards accomplishment of the level is also much more important in this game.\u00a0According\u00a0to me, this game is constructed correctly.

A strategy game that instructs within itself the challenges that could be symbolically related to the instances in our daily life. \nBeing the Luminator of Alora, the task given was to develop the community by predicting risks and to make sure that there is advancement in the society. It was a very challenging game as it enables us to take decisions and take the right amount of risks by researching on them. By building pods, the rate of development would increase and thereby making the environment much safer.\nIt was important to note that there should be a sense of balance throughout as we had to check for few constraints before we could develop and safeguard the land. This aspect taught me the significance of accountability that we possess in our lives to take care of the environment we live in and also to take considerable amount of risks on an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the community to bear the shocks but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It is indeed really important to research on the risks that come our way and eventually develop on a protection plan to minimize the damages from it. Insurance is also a key element in the game, as it ensures and safeguards the land from major damage. It will be cheaper and quicker to rebuild the pods after damage. Striking a balance between them all and performing each action with utmost care was indeed a very challenging task. \nWhile playing the game, it was also important to do proper time management as we had a time constraint in developing the land of Alora and also to protect them from the waves caused by the meteors. So within the specified time, good research, protection, development and insurance against the damages were to be done in the best possible way. Good research was mandatory as it educated us with the performance and the severity of the meteors and how it could affect the environment. Preparation of risks also helped in money management. Building the right number of pods with the given budget and also to insure them was a decision that we had to take after much reflection and thought.\n By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage. \nIf I were to develop a new version of the game, I would have made it comparatively more realistic by introducing real life situations of protecting a city or environment and have obstacles and risks in relation to the real-life scenarios.

A trade off was necessary between knowledge , protection and insurance  Before taking actions and spending money on them , we need to first decide the proper measure between knowledge protection and insurance to save our island alora from the comets attacking our island . i confronted with the problem of resources which are scarce in existence like we have to decide that how we have to spend on insurance so as to protect ourselves from the fallling comets and on protection which costs one dollar for 1 % and we needed enough protection so that it matches with the severity of the comets so that no damage happens to our pods .At the same time , we also need to see that in the face of building resilience , we also need to focus on development of the island by building it costing 200$ and then upgrading it from time to time which costs 295$ ,422$ etc.And all this we have to manage within a short span of given time so time is also an important factor for managing risks .\nI have played this several times to understand its concept. After playing for the first time , i get to know how to protect my island from comets in a more organized way  than before .At the first instance , I didn't understand how to confront all of things together i.e. research, protection and insurance for development.But after playing again, things became clearer.Each pod that i built helped to increase my development level.I got to know that by obtaining insurance , pods damaged from flooding will be quicker and easy to rebuild .Moreover insurance also recovers lost development time after the pods are repaired .Therefore, in a similar way, we will expertise in the field of managing risks if we do it consistently like in  this game we did.This game taught us that by using these three weapons in concert with development we can create a healthy community. The only way to succeed is to find the perfect balance at the cost of our precious resources.Hence risk management is a powerful tool for development.\nThe one thing that I would like to add is the number of risks in this game to make it more challenging and involving.Like other than the flood , other risks such as earthquake and other epidemics can be introduced which we face in our daily lives and more insurance schemes can be introduced to increase the awareness of insurance. The place where i live is a place which is trapped in droughts.So people over here has got no incentive to  take risks and undertake a new project because of lack of water.So insurance an be provided from the loss arising out of the epidemic.\nHence I can say that risks are a concomitant of change and opportunity.\n"}, "2431": {"evaluations": {"0": {"clarity": "1", "comprehension": "1", "comments": "Thank you very much for your reflection paper.

Today i want to tell you my reflection about Risk Horizon game. From the game beginning it's too boring for education game, at the same time i could read something about Risk management and get more useful information. Anyway i should make report about this game. Cerainly, main role in this game assigned for risk management (because it is main theme of our course). In the world of Alora you are obviously King and should decide sharing of resources between three things - exploring of comets, using protection slider and using insurance (i ve bought twice insurance, and in both times it hasn't helped me). Player getting resources for building and upgrading pods, but when pod on upgrade - it doesnt give money and we should have, in my honest opinion, 5 pods and try to upgrade it as fast as we can, but dont forget about main objective of this game and spend resources to get no damage for our pods. I ve made very simple sharing of resources, because insurance didnt make a sense for me. I held medium level on protections slider and maximum exploring of comets to get more time if comet ll not miss. Risk management doesnt interfare in game beginning, because almost all comets in the game beginning miss. Then your game depends of your strategy with pods. I mean decision to make a lot of 1 lvl pods, or 4-5 pods and upgrading it. Second strategy are more success. Anyway you starting to feel risk management since 3-4 level, because on Alora falls too many comets and you can't explore them all just because of the time it will take. The main thing I learned from this game - insurance doesnt work, spending fo resources. I played about 3 - 4 times. The main thing i changed in every next game - pods building strategy. My first time decision to rush all island with 1 level pods and then start to upgrade it led me to fiasco. Its funny simple model of risk management, but i get bored of playing it 4-5 times, when one of aspect doesn't work. But at the same time pretty nice that my game on fourth level depends of my decisions on the first.

The central problem is how to manage scarce resources, represented in the game as time and money. Maybe if you are a former gamer or have experience in strategy games, the time would not be a problem because of, along the time, you develop and upgrade pods faster, and thus you have more time to research the comets. \n\nAt the beginning, I had as priority getting the full insurance package and develop just a few pods, but I spent more time rebuilding than upgrading the pods. Then, I change my strategy and I built all the pods in order to obtain more money and invest in higher levels of protection. In consequence, I can\npass until de third level, where I was hit by a powerful comet just before time was over, so I can\u2019t rebuild and reach the development level required to keep me in the competition. \n\nAs unfortunate fact, I have to say that, afterward I review peer\u2019s advises\nin the forum, I play again, but my internet connection fail the entire weekend. So, I can accomplish my goal at the time of getting this reflection done. Thus, I only can suppose that the best strategy is build all the pods, get the minimum package of\ninsurance, and keep the protection at least to the fifth level. Furthermore, it\u2019s very important focus on the comets with high severity and change-of-hitting levels; because the time you spend on repairing is a lot, especially when you have all the pods\nbuilt. From my experience with the game, I may suggest add more information to allow the gamer evaluate what is the more cost-effective option. For instance, I like to know how much I receive from each pod\u2019s level, in order to decide upgrade the pods,\nget a better insurance package or improve my protection. As well the real challenges that actually face policy makers, information allows them obtain better result with a short experience curve.
