Â Â The game offers three choices for risk management, including Protection, Insurance, and Knowledge (i.e. Research). Â Protection and Insurance are money-costly and I normally need to trade-off one for the other. Â Knowledge is time costly. Â  To successfully manage the risk of comets hit which causes waves, I used the following priority order:Â Protection, Knowledge and Insurance. Â Â Using the above three choices mayaffect development in both way (i.e. immediately or after some time). Â For example,Â protection and insurance are costly, which may slow down the developmentprogress. Â Obtaining knowledge on the comets may help to avoid, or reduce the damage if the risks realize (i.e. the comet hit causing waves)in the future.Â Â I changed my strategyseveral times until I get to the level 6 of the game. Â The first times I played (from 1stÂ Â to 4th times), I focused on developing the communityfirst, then doing the risk management (i.e. protection, research and insurance).Â  Normally I passed level 1 and failed at level2 after getting 1 or 2 damages caused by the comet hits.Â I changed my strategies afterthat.Â  I kept the number of pods inthe community at 3 or 4 at the first two levels, while using the bank and the time I have to do more preparation for riskmanagement (i.e. improve protection, do more research or buy insurance).Â  Later on, when the bank grew up, I invested more in the pods and did more preparation for risk managementÂ simultaneously. Â After getting to level 6Â (which I failed at the latest attempt), I have learnedÂ the following main points from the game: Â To develop, we need totake risks (no pods, no damage).Â Resources for riskmanagement are limited, we may need the trade-offs among the different types of the resources.Â  Â Â Utilise time to learnabout the risk will help to improve protection significantly. Risk management is thekey component of developments.Â For sustainable development,we need to balance the development level of the community and riskmanagement.Â  Â If I can change or add one simple thing in this wonderful game, I would add the function ""Differentiation of the Position of the Pods"". Â In the game, the locations ofthe Pods are not really important.Â  All pods are located in the same place, contributing the same level of development to the community, andÂ getting the same damage if the comets hit and cause waves. Â Thus, I wouldlike to add the above-mentioned function to choose the location for the Pods. Â For example, the pods located at higher place (e.g. a mountain) shall get less damages by the comets hit, while their costs are higher. Â In addition, the money they bring up may higher while the costs for protecting them may also higher. Â Â Â In this regard,Â the player may have a choice of whereto locate the pods, what position should be better protected, and in an extreme case, the player may choose to abandon an individual location of pods when the comets come, for the development of the whole community.Â I believe riskmanagement choices should also include what region (in the community) to beprotected, and the level of protection as well.Â  Thus Ibelieve the above function will better reflect risk management in the realcommunity."124.6.181.178,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,17.0 to 30.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"The game is about assessing the â€œshocksâ€ù (meteors) and matching it against what resources you have or needed to have to mitigate damage and destruction. I have to play it many times before I was able to fully understand the dynamics and needed â€œskillâ€ù to succeed. Just like in the real world, if we are confronted with something that we have little knowledge of, we will end up â€œshockedâ€ù. But we learn from experience and the next time something similar happens we become more prepared. In my first two games, I was buying an insurance â€“ the premium one. But I learned that I donâ€™t have to buy the insurance, I just have to study the meteor and/or increase protection while at the same time developing the pods. Basically, I just use the resources (money) to improve the pods and increase protection (raising the elevation). There are meteors that you just ignore because you have already enough protection to survive its impact. Another element that I was ignoring at first was the green indicator of progress at the left side of the screen. I didn't know what it was really for, until I started adding more pods and developing them, the indicator starts to rise according to the number and the development of the pods. I thought it would just advance (improve) in timeâ€_and all I have to do is just to prepare for the meteors. All in all, it is about managing resources - time and money to achieve the objective of surviving the meteors.  With regards to the the changes that I want to make to the game, let me first describe where I am from and what is our current situation. I am from Zamboanga City, Philippines. Relative to the other parts of the Philippines, we seldom experience natural calamities and disasters, especially, storms and flooding. There is also no known active volcano in the area. However, what we enjoy in terms lesser natural and disasters and calamities is shadowed by the threat of peace and order. Just recently, our city was under sieged by a breakaway Muslim rebel group. This is something that the whole part of Southern Philippines is experiencing (in various degrees)â€“ a constant conflictâ€_unstable peace and order because of cultural and ethnic differences of the people and because of others who take advantage of the situation.  And so, if I am to make a simple change in the game, it will be adding dialogue or replacing insurance with dialogue. I feel that a constant dialogue between people of different tribes and cultures can bring about better understanding between them. Allowing people to be more tolerant, patient, and sensitive to other person's culture which in turn'll bring about harmony...and hopefully a lasting peace. "200.113.217.22,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Thethree components (research, insurance and protection) of risk management playedan important role as tools to assess the severity of the threat, to reduce thelevel of damage and serve as a shield to protect against any loss caused byflooding.

Role of Risk ManagementThe ""risk horizon"" game provided a visual method of showing the importance of risk management techniques for risk mitigation. These were:Growth: ability to take risk by building pods to generate more revenueKnowledge: the importance of research and the ability to track probabilitiesProtection: methods of protecting pods from floods caused by cometsInsurance: use of insurance to enable rebuilding at lower costsCommunity: ability to band communities together to share risk and rewardKnowledge enabled buying protection and insurance based on probability. The result was the ability to better resource growth when probability of a comet hit was lower. It appeared that high growth with a lack of risk mitigation was an unsustainable strategy.2. What to do Differently When Playing AgainIt is not clear how the algorithms for knowledge, protection and insurance play out. In other words, the value per dollar spent on protection or insurance is not obvious when first playing the scenario. One needs testing by making the pod development the same in 2 games and adjusting for high protection/lower insurance in one and low protection/higher insurance in the other. Once protection and insurance return is understood, the next stage is to adjust for growth. The problem with this ""A-B"" testing approach is that it may help get better points in the game, but might be immoral in real life. For example, eliminating protection for flooding through insurance may result in far more deaths even if this was more economical.3. Recommended Change to the GameThe game could provide feedback about risk appetite. Game players are faced with examining risk probability as multiple comets fly overhead and deciding on growth, protection and insurance. It might be helpful in learning risk management to provide a risk matrix that shows users where their risk mitigation strategy falls in probability by impact when clicking on comets. This would be more useful than attempting to visualize probability by impact with the little bars. Users may get focused on probability rather than the combination of probability and impact. This may also require a little more explanation about the risk matrix in the course. This explanation would be helpful because the risk matrix is a very useful visual tool for evaluating risk and getting agreement in a group of people."213.73.185.203,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"The purpose of the game â€“ Risk Horizon â€“ is to develop acommunity of Alora by building and upgrading pods. The community faces aconstant risk â€“ comets. These comets can destroy pods. The risk can be managedin several ways â€“ by obtaining insurance to cover some of the losses incurred,by researching comets and building connections within the community, and byincreasing protection (the slider bar). All these methods have certain monetarycost (for example insurance costs certain amount of money), cost related to forfeitedopportunities (for example when a player is engaged in research he or shecannot engage in other activities), or a combination of the two costs (forexample increasing protection with the slide bar costs money and results intemporary forfeiture of development opportunities). I played the game multiple times and tested various riskmanagement strategies. First, I tried playing without any risk management, butconcentrated on building and upgrading pods only. This very quickly led to aloss in the game. Then, I tried to employ one of the risk management tools atthe time (knowledge, insurance, or protection). This usually led to a loss inlevels 1 or 2. Therefore, I realized that in order to succeed in the game, allrisk management strategies had to be employed and balanced at the same time. Bydoing so I was able to reach level 4 of the game. It is also worth mentioning that the first few times I played the game, I did not feel comfortable enough to employ all risk management strategies at the same time. In particular, I struggled to understand the importance of comet research.Â While the game was really good at capturing, in a simplifiedway, various aspects of risk management, it suffered from one deficiency, in myopinion. Based on my experience with the game, it seems that it does notpromote savings in any way. I was actually more successful when I fully usedall the money at my disposal, as soon as it became available. I feel likehaving savings in the face of a serious risk is actually good, and provides asafety cushion, which allows for a better recovery. Therefore, it wouldactually be nice to allow users to set some money aside so that it can be usedto deal with the damage caused by comets. This would actually make itÂ a little more realistic. "115.84.235.70,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Role of risk management in the gameâ€”giving warning throughresearch and the ability to know the severity and the chance of target.

Researchincreases, while protection deletes it but continues to be useful even afterzero. Preparing for risk impedes development and competes in the allocation of resources.However, the component of Research, Protection and Insurance were of a good help. However, they became stumbling block as well against time and resources. Research, took most of the time because the cursor has to focus on the comets and wait upon the progress.

The game brought out the relevance of the risk management andthe application of available tools for development.While development is the KPI in this game, there areuncertainties which affect development. This game illustrated very well the applicationof risk management elements and tools viz. knowledge (research to gain thatknowledge about events), protection by raising the level of pods, insurance andcoping (making community connections and having to rebuild the pods by savingahead for those repairs).The trade-offs were quite apparent in the sense that youwould have less resources for development while you devote some towardsprotection and insurance. I made a choice to start development immediately,protect existing development by raising level to reduce damage and haveinsurances in place for repairs, early on in the game. The initial costsrelated to protection and insurance far outweigh the benefits of damage fromcomet hits later on.One thing was, I invested in research as soon as I sighted acomet on the horizon, so it gives more time to prepare and make community connectionsin the event it happens. Another thing I did, was to make sure there were some$ always available to make repairs â€“ the lesser the damage.2. I should admit I did a few iterations to reach level 3 but havenâ€™tcrossed it. So obviously, I havenâ€™t got the development-resource-risk equationsor the diversification part right. Perhaps I invested too much in protectionand insurance. After the first attempt where I lost in level 2, I was tryingdifferent combinations of resource allocation to development, protection andinsurance. The equations were not apparent and there was not enough time tofigure them out.If I were to play only once I would try to broaden developmentfirst and then focus on protection and insurance in that order. It seems alogical way to approach development in general. The uncertainties such asnatural disasters depicted in the game could result in any outcome but I think thatthis approach could work in the long term as more development would moreresources to protect, insure and cope.For me, the game was quite insightful in thinking about my approachto the development problem (rather to life in general). My learning is that forsuccessful development, you have to figure out the development-resource-riskequations. Community connections are very important in expediting developmentby sharing knowledge and coping experiences.3. First of all, fantastic game with a lot of insights and practicalrelation with life/development, in general. One thing I would like to add thegame is community connections before the event to share the coping experiences.I think if one were to have advance information about preventive actions and howto cope, one would be better placed to cope with the risks and outcomes.This is the same change I would encourage to better managerisk in my workplace and community at large. I believe we donâ€™t have to reinventthe wheel every time to discover solutions for successful development. We canlearn vicariously from othersâ€™ experiences and approaches. However, blindlyfollowing othersâ€™ approach will not yield success. Every context has differentequations and requires tailored solutions."69.251.2.39,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. The game, simple as it is, teachesone to maintain the proper balance between research, investment,preparation, insurance.The risk management had the role tocorrectly assess the damage after being hit, to take the bestmeasures for the less possible damage and for the better recovery.My preferred choices were to research,buy insurance and build, the trade-off being a slower development.The impact on development was bothshort and long-term, as the investments in research and insurancereduced the development speed but also the energy level was moredifficult to keep over time.2. I played the game several times,trying to change parameters from one game to another. I started byfocusing on the quick development of the â€œtownâ€ù, upgrading thepods, then I decided towards the strategy of building as many pods aspossible and neglecting to upgrade them. At the beginning I observedthat it is difficult to withstand the damage received by thebuildings, and that research is an important part of the process. Ifound out that no matter how well developed the â€œtownâ€ù is,neglecting the community is a bad idea: community connection can helpyour long term protection. By connecting to neighbors and communityyou manage to decrease the shock and of course the impact that therisk will have on the community, so I invested more in research toallow me more time to develop the mutual support of the pods.Obviously, the first step I did at thebeginning of each level was the insurance. It costs more and slowsthe upgrading down but the repair costs are lower and it looks betterwhen you draw the line at the end. I also tried to the raise theplatform to a level that does not influence my research time verymuch but together with the research allows the best protection.3. Since the primary threat is comets,I would add one single item: a weapon that can be used to blast off acomet before it hits the sea once per level, so the comet assessed asthe biggest threat would be eliminated.However, to maintain the balance of thegame, I would condition the firing of the gun with a drop of theplatform level.The changes I would propose concerningthe risk management choices that matter in the area I live wouldinvolve the climate induced risks, such as floods, heavy rains orsnows, fires due to storms.I would improve real estate insurancestrategies, I would increase prevention for damages produced bystorms, hurricanes, heavy rains.I would focus on building new dams orimprove the existing ones to prevent floods."98.122.63.42,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Greeting from Alora!While Alora is not a real place, the choices are! Â Basically, the game is an illustration of ""scarcity."" Â It is a story of asset allocation and risk mitigation. Â It is an exercise in lowering ""shocks"" (comet crashes) and increasing prosperity (pods and pod upgrades). Â The game,Â RiskHorizon, uses very limited but effective variables to teach these lessons. Â The player can choose different risk allocation by changing their choices in the game. Â Game choices for risk mitigation are: Â 1) knowledge, 2) Â protection, and 3) Â insurance. Â The assets to be allocated are: Â 1) Â wealth and 2) Â time (after all the game is timed and you only have a certain time to reach the desired goal). Â Accordingly, a player must constantly make trade-off choices between the various risk mitigation safeguards while effectively maximizing their asset allocations. Â For example, a player can gain ""knowledge"" on a comet by simply clicking on the comet in question. Â This builds up ""connection time"" should the comet actual strike and allows for risk mitigation in that way; however, while a player is engaged in this ""knowledge"" pursuit, they can not do any other activities as their cursor is ""locked"" on the comet---so, the players cost is time. Â This is only one example of the myriad of choices that this simple, yet effective, game teaches.I played the game multiple times, varying strategies each time. Â I constantly struggled with the question: Â Is it better to build several small pods or a few larger ones? Â Is it better to have more insurance or more time (""knowledge"") for community linkage? Â In the beginning, Â I took the approach that I would just build out as quickly as possible and take my chances with the comets (what the financial analysis would call a ""risk on"" approach). Â The results were not good, and it quickly became clear to me that attempts to ""overpower"" the risk by simply attempting to ""out-grow"" the resource problem would not work. Â In order to experience any long term success (to reduce the ""shocks""), I had to engage in all elements the game allowed for risk mitigation---insurance (often at the 75% level), knowledge (often building up the maximum community connection time), and protection (raising the cities level above the sea). Â If I could redesign the game, I think I would try to increase the ""knowledge component"" of the game. Â It would be a ""super-knowledge"" component where it not only cost time but a great deal of wealth---maybe this would be like a ""comet shield"" or ""under ground/water"" pods. Â The protection afforded by this ""super knowledge"" component would be higher (perhaps complete), but it would have a high ongoing expense to maintain. However, while this may enhance the choices and outcomes, it would not change the basic principles of economics at the core of the game: Â all resources have a scarcity factor; diversification produces better overall risk mitigation; and, at some point, virtually every action has a point of diminishing returns.Signing out from Alora!"115.113.11.220,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The risk horizon game is a beautiful representation of the importance of risk management in real life for individuals, firms and societies. In real world, risk can be perceived and experienced by entities because of a wide array of probable and possible events and similarly there are gamut of risk mitigation and management strategies that are available. The game succinctly classifies the various risk mitigation strategies under the labels of research, protection and insurance.I played the more than once as I had difficulty understanding how to reach the next levels in the first few instances of the game. However, I realized the importance of the various options of risk mitigation by the end of the third iteration of the game and could reach level 5 in the fourth instance of my game. The wide range of choices and trade-offs I had to make to pass each level amazed me. I will try to explain what I had learned through my decision making process in the game in the next couple of paragraphs.To start with, I had to first make the choice of how many pods I have to build in the first couple of levels as I had a limit on the amount of money I could spend on building them as well as upgrading them. After building a few pods in the first few levels, I had to focus on the risk mitigation strategies based on the severity, chance of impact and speed at which the comets were arriving. I focused mainly on playing safe by protecting Alora by investing in insurance and protection before even the comets started to fall on the island. In fact I have realized that protection was more effective than research in the instance of my game. Research was equally (or slightly less) important as it reduced the damage due to the impact.To sum up, I focused on these issues in this order (first one most important)1. Protection2. Insurance3. Development and Expansion of Pods on the Island4. ResearchÂ Thanks to the team for conceptualizing such a nice game. The game in itself was very good but if I was given a chance to modify or make a change to the game, I would bring in some spatial and temporal elements. Disruption risk events do not impact each place in a region equally and recovery from these events also takes different amount of time for different places in a region. This would also mean changes in the protection and insurance levels for different pods at different places on the island.For example, if Alora was placed as an island in the middle of the sea and comets keep falling at different places, how would an individual make choices on levels of protection, insurance and research. This would add slight level of complication to the game but nevertheless would be interesting according to me."122.117.137.129,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â  The role of risk management in the game was preparing for the potential disaster (shock) caused by the falling comets.Â  While building and upgrading pods, I also increased protection, did research on comets (enhance knowledge), and purchased insurance.Â  The preparation for risk affected development by reducing the damages caused by the falling comets.Â  For example, by continuing research on comets and increasing protection, the damages caused by the falling comets could be minimized. By clicking on the comet and keeping its box focused on the screen, I was able to accumulate research.Â  Doing research on the comets will also provide knowledge on the chance of hitting and severity of potential damages.Â  Using the knowledge, i increased protection and purchased insurance accordingly.Â  Because of the accumulated research, there is more time for creating community connections.Â  When the falling comets hit, the damages could be reduced.Â  However, sometimes, there could still be some damages.Â  The insurance could help cover part of the cost for rebuilding the damaged pods.Â  2.Â  I played the game more than once.Â  At first, I didn't really pay attention to research on the falling comets.Â  Thus, initially, I only increased protection and purchased insurance in preparation for the potential damages that could be caused by the falling comets.Â  However, after I found out about clicking on the comet and keeping its box focused on the screen to accumulate research, I did that and was able to reduce damages significantly.Â  Moreover, when I see a comet with a potential for severe damages, I increased protection level even further and purchased insurance to cover the potential risk of damages.Â  By doing so, I was able to minimize the damages caused by the falling comets. I learned that it is important to balance development (building and upgrading pods) with risk management (preparing for the damages caused by the comets).3. If I am tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows me to change or add one simple thing, I would propose to add the risk of scarcity or depletion of natural resources available for building the pods (materials needed to build the pods).Â Â  This could potentially increase the cost of the materials for building the pods.Â  One way to solve the problem would be to use alternative materials that are more abundant.Â  This may require research for new technology and innovation to find methods and materials that are more accessible and sustainable."81.232.77.60,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of the risk management in the game was large. In order to succeed in the game IÂ had toÂ try to prevent damages and also fix the damage after it had occured. So same time I needed to prepare for the worst, and also take preventive measures and think what can I do after if a damage occurs. Building and upgrading pods was needed so I could enter the next level. Same time I had to think other things such as investing in research and thinking what type of insurance I need. Research wasÂ  important in order to predict where and when actionÂ  is mostly needed.

I learnt many things after the first trials and always adjusted my actions for the future strategies. For example, I learnt that I don't needÂ to save my money but instead should invest more in developing the community.Â Â Only after I did that, could I move on to the next level. If I should change something in order to make the game better, I would show the instructions somehow better in the beginning. People must have a good knowledge on things in order to know what to do. This would in real life translate into having an education on the topic of risk management and tools related to that (either formal or informal education). I think also trial and error teaches us a lot, but knowing the rules of the game, i.e. being educated on importantÂ things in advance, is vital in my opinion. Overall, I learnt quite a lot from this game. Most important lesson I learnt was that I should study instructions before I start something, i.e. have an education or training in real life.

And further I found out, that I dont have to spend all my money to make the best protection for my community, but I rather decided to make a research every time a new meteor appeared in the sky. When there weren't any meteors, I focused only on building new pods and upgrading them to make more profitable community and my protection was average. 1. Preparation for risk affect development after some time, especially, when more big meteors (it means meteors with large probability of hit and large severity) came in the same time. Â In this game was the role of risk management very important, becaus without preparation it would lead to many shocks and the community could not be developed. I described my choices above this answer.2. Like I wrote above, i didnt buy the most expensive insurence every time, but only the cheapest one, because when I realized, that if I take care about preparation very well, I dont have to have any damage on my pods. Second time, I didnt try to make the perfect protection, but only to the point, that was required. It was necessary to check the severity of every meteoir and make a lot of research if some of them had significantly higher severity then my actual protection.Â  I learned from this game, that preparation, research and Â insurance are more important that i thought and it is convenient to invest my money into that, even when it is not easy to implement in real world. I will think about that in my life.3. I would definitely add some information about upgrades. When I played this game, I didnt know, whether I should prefer to build a new pod or upgrade one of the existing ones. And I would make text tutorial too, because when i wanted to find one sentence from tutorial, i didnt want to play the whole tutorial one more time.That is all.Â Thanks for a game and very instructive course to its creators.Â "41.45.174.12,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,n/a,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Riskmanagement has definitely played a huge role in the game. For starters, it hasput me in a situation where I have had to balance many different issues,however small in amount, to achieve the growth required in the limited timegiven. It has opened my eyes to how important these decisions can be,especially in terms of what is given up in return for development. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Forexample, at the beginning of the game, I gave each element equal importance,and failed miserably by the end of level 2 or 3. However, when I gave verylittle importance to research, and cut down my insurance by one level, I wasable to maintain the growth the game required of me in the limited time.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Themain things I learned from this game was how important certain aspects of theresources given allows you to judge what is more important. I did giveprotection quite a bit of my attention, but by level I increased it and reliedon community connections to make up for the shortcomings.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If Iwere to add a simple element to this game to make it more realistic to where Ilive, I would add the human element. I think we rarely look at how human behaviouraffects the outcomes of risk management. With insurance, adequate protectionand even research, human behaviour matters greatly. If the population isunhappy, the effort they would give to rebuild and develop would be mediocre,to say the least. I believe adding that extra â€˜population response/happinessâ€™would add more challenge to the game instead of just increasing the number andpace of meteor hits.Â "24.7.23.29,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. Role of risk management:Â Once there are 1 or 2 communities created, purchase the most amount of insurance that can be afforded, while keeping some money in case repairs are needed.Â Increase protection in small increments once 1 or 2 communities are created. Â This provides incremental protection in the event of a hit. Over time, as I have more money to increase protection, my communities are better shielded from hits, and they take lesser damage. I have more time to make connections when I am hit and often are able to completely mitigate damage.In time, knowledge in the form of accuracy about meteor severity and chance to hit helped me decide when to ignore a meteor completely and focus on community building (allowing the bar to turn green).2. I played it more than once. What would I do differently next time?Â Build slowly. Ensure that building and protection are being built at the same time. Â The first time, I grew my communities too quickly and I was unable to provide enough protection when struck by a severe hit. Expand communities (increase level) slowly too. After building or growing each community, wait to make sure the bar can turn green before building/expanding more.Â Always buy insurance.Â 3. What change would I make to better represent management choices that are relevant to where I live:Biggest risk: Risk of systemic financial shock coupled with high risk of earthquakes common to this part of the world (California Bay Area). Â While systemic financial risk is not specific to where I live, the housing market in this area is very closely tied to the financial economy. I fear a major earthquake, which has been predicted to be long overdue for this area, coupled with a simultaneous shock to the financial market, which would in turn affect the high-tech industry (main-stay industry in this area), would cripple the economy here. Many will be out of work, unable to pay mortgages, forced to abandon or foreclose, etc. To reflect this in the game, the game could introduce unforeseen earthquakes. Since earthquakes are not easily predicted in real life, the fact is we never know when the big one will hit. In the game, there would be no way to achieve the right level of protection for it. Â Some scenarios in the game can feature earthquake-only hits, with random levels of severity. Other scenarios can represent the culmination of a large financial shock and an earthquake (or several small earthquakes to represent a series of aftershocks), which will likely send the player scrambling to regroup the resources, and hoping there is enough money saved up for necessary repairs, sufficient insurance to mitigate damage, and some level of protection to reduce damage caused."88.177.216.48,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Game Reflection: Risk Horizon GameThe role of risk management in thegame was in the same line as the World Development Report, they both agreed. Itfocus its importance in preventive actions, information to reach a betterunderstanding of the problems and their possible outcomes through research (knowledge), protection from defensive mechanisms and the community power,through actions to diminish the likelihood or size of the impact; and copyingwith damages or losses in bad times, thanks to the insurance through effective reparation (these are actions totransfer resources to the most affected sectors). Among the strategies I used toachieve better results, I start purchasing the most inclusive insurance, I kepta constant medium level of protection at least, especially in the periods whenthere were no imminent risks, Â and I didas much â€œresearchâ€ù as I could, to maximize the level of knowledge. Preparation for risk definitely worked better inthe medium-long term, when the three elements (knowledge, protection andinsurance) were at a good functioning level. In a low level, consequences weremuch more negative and severe. So preparation for risk affect development later,after some time.To answer the second block ofquestions, I played the game few times and I have tried different strategies: Igave more or less importance to several options, discovering that researchusually helps the most ,along with insurance, to minimize the negative effects,to the point of even avoiding them. The first time I played, I tried toincrease the protection over research, but I found over time that it was noteffective. The main thing I learned from the game support the leaning processin this course: One interesting thing that I have learnt is that despite somemedium level protection interfaces, community power could really have a goodimpact in mitigating the damages; this is, through communication, mutualsupport and preparation. Also, I noticed risk is variable, and it is importantto research and pay attention to all kinds constantly: slow, non-frequentevents could be as damaging as quick or repeated threats. To me, the waveindicates the consequences of this negative event, so it represents the Â harmful consequences. After those, communitycame back to a previous stage of protection (less good), which outlines the necessityfrom the state to revise constantly this methods, keeping them up to date,improving them, to maximize the benefits for the community and to minimize potentiallosses. Besides, placing myself on the policy making side, on theadministrative side, on the high responsible side I realize about one thing:there is never enough time, risk is constant and there is no idyllic risk planning,it should be done at the same time as the population develops, it is not to bepostponed.Answering the third question, if Icould give some ideas to improve a new version of this game Â I would introduce risks of different natures,such as socio-economic, for example an economic recession; or related tohealth, illness for instance. In the game the risks are simplified to naturaldisasters and in reality we experience broad, complex, different kind of risks.The way they are tacked varies, so I guess it would result very interesting tomake it a bit more complex."24.209.69.47,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The risk management game combined situations of an economy needing to build up it's infrastructure while gaining knowledge about the environment. It was, at times, a tricky balance knowing when to build-out the community versus research a potentially catastrophic event. One of the ways I chose to mitigate risk was by always purchasing the highest quality insurance at the start of each new level of the game. Though sometimes expensive, it allowed me to focus my time on knowledge and protection. By allocating insurance funds at the start of the level I didn't have to spend my time worrying about whether my properties would be destroyed/ critically damaged when the next comet hit because if they were I would have the funds to repair.The first few times that I played the game I didn't research the incoming comets. Once I understood how important the research portion of the game was I was able to maximize my research time based on the severity/ chance of hit.Â  I live in a flat area of the United States. The region sees many tornadoes, often occurring spontaneously, providing little time to react. Our community has installed warning sirens. When the siren sounds, everyone makes their way to the basement. This, in some ways, represents the protection bar. The largest differences here would be damage faced based on infrastructural damage versus the damage a community would face with human fatalities. Luckily, the game doesn't try and quantify these things -- providing a simpler ""percentage damaged"" statistic. This is where the game and reality heavily differ. A risk manager, in any part of the world, will have many more complex factors to consider when identifying risk management strategy's.Â  The game also allowed for infrastructural development. Though not mentioned, this may signify the development of technology, health care, education etc. A community that is developing may be able to get to a point of specialization thus, allowing for faster research, better transfer of knowledge/ protection, and a generally more streamlined ability to grow. This wasn't well represented in the game. Both, knowledge and protection, grew at the same rate from level 1 through level 6. This, of course was an oversight needed for simplicities sack but, may actually play in the favor of reality. By creating this simplified world we have been able to further understand the need for balance, to combine the need to develop infrastructure while also mitigating risk."217.76.18.125,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,-63.0 to -36.0,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"Risk management was an obvious and important part of theRisk Horizon game. The easiest and least costly form of protection was to keepthe Comet info screen open, as to increase the quantity of research. It was mystrategy to have, whenever the game required no action on my part, to have tocomet with the highest impact or highest probability open, as to increase myprotection if/when the comet would hit Alora. A second part of risk managementwas protection, in the form of raising the island. Every level I tried toincrease the amount of protection by 1 or 2 bars, as indicated in the game. Theprotection combined with the research had a significant effect on the riskmanagement of the island. My island was only hit by a few comets with minimaldamage. However, on the instances that a comet with high severity and high probabilityof impact would appear, I would purchase insurance, mostly for 75% of the costs. I think that in the 6levels, I only purchased insurance three times. The other levels I would havesufficient protection to keep comets at bay. Furthermore, when these high severity and high probability comets would appear, I would stop investing in the island as to generate enough reserves to be able to quickly rebuild the island after the hit. If the comet did not create damage, then the money I had saved would be quickly invested in the island, sometimes upgrading as many as 4 buildings at the same time.I played the game several times and I changed my strategy slightlybetween the games. In the first few games I constantly bought insurance,wasting both money and decreasing protection. After realizing my strategy wasnot working, I switched to investing more in protection and only buyinginsurance if the risks faced by Alora were very high. I also had the bad luckof getting very severe impact comets in the last 10 seconds of the game, notgiving me enough time to rebuild the island, even with insurance. If I would recommend one change to the game, I would suggestadding a third factor of protection. The research conducted in the current gameis only relevant for 1 comet. I would suggest giving the player the option toinvest money in a â€˜research center,â€™ which would increase the speed of researchfor all individual comets. The center could have 4 levels, of which level 1 and3 would increase the speed of research, and level 2 and 4 would create an â€˜earlywarning systemâ€™ making the research into any comet start at 1 bar, rather than0.

While waiting for pods to build, I would research thecomets to ensure that my protection was good enough, and I would purchase morepods to gather more income when I felt safe.Â I found that building a lot of pods and protection early made it easierin later parts of the game to upgrade and take no damage when comets actuallyhit.Â  Preparing early for risks negatedany damages I would have experienced and this allowed me to quickly reachdevelopment goals in each level of the game.If I were to play the game again, I probably would notchange my approach since I completed all of the levels. I didnâ€™t find a need tobuy insurance if I kept my protection at maximum levels, and early upgrades forpods meant that I had a very high income to further upgrade pods and recover myprotection when comets did hit.Â  However,if the game continued on and higher severity comets began arriving at higherfrequencies, I would be more inclined to purchase insurance to compensate forthe lack of time I would have had to prepare my defences against the hits.I learned that minimizing risk is extremely important, andinvesting for risk today pays dividends in the future. I am sure that if I didnot properly balance out building up pods with protection, I would have run outof money quickly and failed to reach my development goals.Â  Focusing only on one task while not lookingat all factors that would impact my work as a whole would likely lead todisaster.If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, Iwould add some more interactions that would force the purchase ofinsurance.Â  For example, upgrading manypods impacts the environment in such a way that all comet impacts hit with higherseverity, or high pod upgrades force the protection to be depleted faster. Thiswould demonstrate that our actions have consequences, and if we tamper with oneelement too much it can impact other elements negatively.Â  Having some comets that we cannot protectourselves from would also force the purchase of insurance. We cannot protectourselves from everything in life, but we can mitigate the impacts of thesesituations when they do occur."76.117.84.71,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management had very critical role in the development of Pods. Risk management helped mitigate the Â risk and allowed development to continue. Research provided knowledge to prepare against the comet. Protection provided physical protection for minimizing the impact. Insurance took off high costs for repairs. Knowledge of the risk i.e. severity of the comets, potential damage covered by flexible insurance cover, and protection measure to increase the platform height were pivotal. I utilized little knowledge, Â more insurance and lots of protection to mitigate the risk. Preparation paid off after sometime as first comet caused damage but pods were repaired before next comet hit. Costs were taken care by insurance. More research allowed more time to update communities which was very crucial to minimize the risk.If I played game differently, I would try to do more research and start applying protection immediately. I would choose minimum insurance plan at the start and change it before comet hits based on severity and possibility of hitting. Pod development would continue meanwhile. I would develop existing pods to next levels so that green barometer levels are achieved faster andÂ development momentum is maintained.I learnt that effective risk management for development is right combination of knowledge of the danger, protection from potential damage and proper insurance to cover monetary losses. The concept can be applied for all kinds of risks we face in our lives. Preparation is the key!One change I would like to have in the new version of the game is to have coordinated system for doing research and applying protection accordingly. So that I can put resources for doing research while utilizing the real-time knowledge to apply protection measures accordingly well well within time.Â "190.47.76.197,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"It is a bad, boring game.

Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages.Â -manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks.Â -invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis.Â -the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles.Â The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risksThe game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones. Â  Â Â In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, "" Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity"". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community.Â "135.23.127.186,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"What was the role of risk management in the game? Whatchoices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms ofknowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for riskaffect development?Â Risk Management hadan extremely important role in the game. While on one hand, the objective wasto maximize the growth and development (of the pods), on the other, it was aboutensuring that the risks (damage caused by comets) be minimized, efficiently. Thusthe role of knowledge (research), protection, and insurance was critical. Thechoices that I made related to using knowledge (research on comets) todetermine how I should spend funds on protection and how much should be coveredusing insurance. Since all three options costs money, the core trade-offs hadto be made on the amount that I can spend on buying research, insurance andprotection while at the same time ensuring development. Preparation for riskwas directly related to the development; the better prepared we were, the rateof development, either in the short or long run, was also higher.Â If you played the game only once, what would you dodifferently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the gamemore than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were themain things you learned from the game?Â When the first timeI played the game, I went ahead and immediately bought the most expensiveinsurance to protect the planet against the destruction caused by comets. Lateron I realized that I could do better by first examining the severity and probabilityof the impact and the level of development that I have (high level pods costsmore to repair) and then deciding on the amount of funds to be spent on buyinginsurance. Therefore the main things that I learned from the game were:Â 1.Â Â Â Â The roleof research is very important in decision making (about investing either in development or buying or ensuring protection) and the knowledge about disasters play a verycrucial role in managing them2.Â Â Â Â Anyexpenditure on infrastructure development has to be backed by protectionmeasures and insurance. However, the decision on how much to spend depends on thelevel of knowledge that we have about the disasters: the higher the knowledge,better would be the utilization of funds3.Â Â Â Â Ifdisasters are managed properly, the rate of development is also higher;however, the highly developed infrastructure requires high level of riskmanagement and protection.The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects ofrisk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of thegame, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would youpropose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in theplace you live?The country, inwhich I have lived, has a very high level of corruption. This corruption notonly undermines the development process, it also inhibits ensuring protection againstnatural disasters or other types of shocks. Thus, if I were to develop a newversion of the game, I would include a mechanism for capturing this aspect. Oneway of doing this may be by using a corruption meter which changes according tothe right or wrong decisions that we make in the game. For example, if we buycostly insurance for a disaster with low severity level and low probability ofimpact, then this may reflect high corruption and the player may be penalizedin some way, probably by lowering the development to a certain level.Â "64.121.31.29,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"I played the game several times before successfully reaching level four, so I'll address questions 1 and 2 together.I do not expect that any single ""recipe"" can guarantee success in all repetitions of the game, but playing the game several times gave me a better sense of what I needed to focus on at different points in the game.Â I think initially I was a little too ""timid"" in starting the development process, but, in fact, at the start the game provides us with a relatively large amount of cash and until a substantial amount of development is done there is really not ""much to loose"", which means the needs for protection is small, so,Â in subsequent replays,Â I became a more aggressive ""developer"" in the initial stages of the game. As the value of the developed property increased, I also shifted my risk management strategy to a steady, progressive increase in the protection level (to 5-6) as the best ""first line of defense"", This, together with a reasonable amount of ""research"", allowed me to ""ignore"" a good number of less threatening ""comets"" and optimize the speed of further development. Only when a comet with a potentially very severe (7 or higher) impact appeared did I purchase the highest insurance I could afford. Overall this strategy worked well, allowing me, in the last round I played, to comfortably meet the targets up to level four (I have not yet tried the higher levels).Withe regard to question 3:One thing that was not clear to me in the game were the rules related to the rate of increase/replenishment in ""liquidity"" (cash) that could be used for further development or risk management. In particular it was not clear to what extent this was this process was ""random"" and to what Â extent the earlier development choices made affected the rate of accumulation and/or replenishment of available cash. From a financial standpoint this is critical, as one needs to match the timeline of expected receivable cash-flows and payments (financial assets and liabilities), allowing for ""uncertainty"" Â (comets). I think clarifying this aspect of the game so that the player can take ""financing"" explicitly into account would make the game richer. and more realistic. Along similar lines, adding a ""credit"" option could be interesting:Â for example the player could be allowed to drown a credit line equivalent to a percentage of available collateral, the ""developed property"", with some appropriate ""rate of interest""."24.185.22.222,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"Risk Management was an essential aspect of winning each level in this game, as the planet was constantly facing the risk of annihilation with comets. Raising the level of the planet, buying insurance to protect the revenue stream and doing research on the comets were all part of risk management. In terms of choices or trade-offs, I had to decide early in the game if I should spend the money on insurance or building more pods. Later it was a choice between raising the level of the planet at a growing cost versus upgrading the pods. I also had to trade off comet research with raising the level of the planet as both had a benefit in terms of protecting the planet from damage.Â Preparation for risk hampered development of pods, as while I was raising the level of the planet, further development used to stop, or while I was researching the comets, it was difficult to focus on upgrading the pods.As I played the game multiple times, I learned that there was a fine balance between meeting the revenue generation target to cross each level and having sufficient risk management in place to survive severe damage from comets which sometimes set me back by a lot. After the first time I tried to sequence my pod development, insurance purchase, raising the level of the planet and researching the comet such that I could do a little bit of everything in the limited amount of time which was made available for each level. The main thing I learned from the game was balancing risk management with revenue generation so that a catastrophic event would not cause irreparable damage to my prospects of success.One useful thing for a player would be to get a summary of how much does each pod and an upgraded pod help with revenue generation so an individual can optimize the amount of money to spend on that versus purchase of insurance or raising the level of the planet. Another feature could be to provide some statistics or commentary on what other people have struggled with so players can learn from each others mistakes. Also, the game should allow storing past scores as during my first round I reached level 5 without noting down the codes assuming that after I lose a level I will get the code for my last few levels which I have crossed.

So, getting together all the relevant information about the threat, using data from research and the observance of the previous events, allow the community to get ready to face the threat, and make them recovering faster and cheapest than whether all this would occur without this knowledge.The third lesson learned from the game was about the insurance. When we are able to get the better coverage for our community, we can face the threat more easily, because we don't need to use all the resources that we have to rebuild from the event, the cost will be shared with the others members of the community, making easier to recover after the event hit the community.The last lesson learned was about the integration of all strategies to make the community stronger to face a shock, because if the community have all the information related to the threats it faced, combining with the protection action as reinforce the infrastructureÂ or building a good alarm system and training people for using preventing disasters tools, and be able to share all these systems in a coordinate way, and furthermore having a good insurance coverage, the members of the community created a very good plan of alternatives that reduce the damages and make them stronger getting a very good resilient strategic plan and actions, reducing the efforts to rebuild the day-by-day life of the community after facing the shock, including reducing damages at social, economic and finance levels."80.217.132.191,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"What was the role of risk management in thegame?

This also would mean that I had limited experience of the variablesinvolved.I startedout developing level two buildings on about half the area, then pumped up theprotection, probably higher then needed.

On replay I would probably do more research on eachpossible impact event generally, but focusing on high impact events. As I had to learn whileplaying, I spent a lot of time on â€œnothingâ€ù as in using the interface for otherthings.I wouldalso try to observe more closely, the building to income connection, and howprotection is reduced by impacts. The latter is very important at high levelsof protection as it takes both money and time to gain that back. Those are thefrontiers that limit development, more or less. At higher levels of protectionand game levels (higher) insurance might be more optimal, in part.I have abackground both in economics, risk management (financial), gaming and gamedesign, so I mostly viewed this as very meta, as in what are they trying to achieve.Â It would be very hard for me to viewthis game with fresh eyes.Â Changesin game mechanicsYou canmake the economy slightly more complicated, instead of one input(buildings/machines) you could ad population (I would make it a â€œroofâ€ù forproduction that grows over time but is also affected by impacts).Also, whileit might be advantageous to have lower protection then max, and boost insurancehigher up, adding a â€œpopular opinionâ€ù measurement that drops on damages and thatkick you out would also mean more realism.

But as youinvest in counter measures, you have also to take into account that you need todevelop the community. Â The game made meconfront the trade-off affecting the way I took decisions constantly, in theway that you have to stop investing in development of the community to makepreparations, taking insurance and research the comet so the impact doesnâ€™ttake too much of the development I have to the moment.

Managing the income gets, naturally, harder as you go forth so the decisionshave to be coherent from the beginning of the game so you donâ€™t have itdifficult to develop the community in the highest levels.To betterrepresent the risk faced by the community, I would add an Idiosyncratic effect,so the impact doesnâ€™t affect all equally but some more heavily than others.This matter brings more realism to the game as each part of the community donâ€™tface the same risk equally, and the cost furthermore be equivalent to theimpact. And as the community develops more, facing another risk not only cometsbut other types of risk like population over growth and in a systemic way,floods or frosts that destoy also the food.

Protection that i was able to complete with the knowledge of the disaster and the time obtain to build more connectionif i were play the game again, i would invest more in insurance at the beginning. Less protection but a good coverage would help more to develop quickly the city, thus gain more resources. I noticedÂ it was more useful and efficient Â at mid-term.Â to get a good insurance coverage compare to build a strong protection immediately,Â The main things learned from this game are to prioritize the tasks in order to insure the well developing of the city. Oriented my strategy on a long term development. Better to go slowly for developing facilities but be sure everything is safe.Â If i were tasked with developing a new version of the game, i would have added the psychological dimension of the population. In other words, the behaviour approach of the human being. For example, more you invest your time to educate the population about the risk of disaster and their consequences, less the cost to protect the city will be expensive or faster you could build your protection. That can be a good to understand the importance of the public actors as government to make their population aware about the risk.The change i would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i am living would be to develop more regulation about the protection of food resources, particularly about the access to the clean water. Also develop the protection against the rising of the sea. I am living at the Â border of the sea, lot of building and infrastructure has been build on the 70's without any consideration about this kind of risk."200.106.92.81,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was very important, in order to gain thegoal of building and developing the community. First of all was to getinformation of how long it would take to have enough money to buy the plots andinsurance. In my game was always important to have insurance and then obtaininformation of the comets to make efficient decisions related with giving moreprotection for the village or invest in better plots. When I past the level 4 Irealized that insurance and giving more protection, gave me the opportunity toinvest faster than other level in better plots and houses, and also I chose aless expensive insurance. For me investing in protection was more effective fortaking care of lives of the community, so then we can grow in an organized way,and also do not have a bigger damage after a comet hit the community.Ithink is important to get information of the village, the time and money youneed to get protection, the proper way to grow and with all this research makethe best decisions that benefits all the community. The priority was to develop a mitigation plan anduse in a wise way wealth and resources I have for the community. I couldrealized that maybe do not focusing only in improve the shelters was thepriority, and instead it was to invest in a better insurance or protection, andthen buy more plots. In my case, I prefer to buy fewer plots and increase theinvestment on them, and in the next level complete the plots and making themgrow. With this decision, I can have strongest plots and when disaster appears,the plots can communicate better and damage is not that bigger.About the game, I think it was a good way to introduce ourselves to makedecisions and realized what trade-offs we are able to do in order to managebetter a risk. It is not easy for policy makers to prepare a plan prioritizingnot only between one or two risk, they are more and the idea is to invest inthe best way our wealth to save more lives. For that, stronger protection isneeded and it is important that community stay connected and organized. Also,that government always use information and invest in technologies andinsurance, because with it the can save more lives and spend less amount ofmoney in it.

Risk management was mostly centered on preventing the infrastructure from being ruined or halted from its development and dealing with the after effects of the meteors. When it came to money i was divided between construction of new buildings, improving old ones, buying insurance or some other means of risk prevention. Development was affected both in the long run and the short run, being limited to continuing on a project, fixing an old one, upgrading or starting again. Risk preparation was a limiter to continuing the project but also one that helped it continue after a meteor strike. The times I repeated the game, I built less buildings and focused mostly on research of the meteors, buying insurance and other measures to prevent a large impact on the project. Also the few buildings I made I continued to improve and upgrade them until I had enough money to build smaller and cheaper new ones. As for Risk Management in general it is a constant and never ending process, even after a project is finished. Being constantly ready to notice a possible event that will hinder the place where the project is moving forward. Not only that the stress this causes is considerable which also means that any risk manager must have a clear mind, iron will and sound judgement. It was interesting how the time researching took from the time to build and improve, even when some buildings where already finished. Which I think makes an important point on how to manage ones time when managing risk. The brings me to my second point, the tactics one chooses to create their risk management Â strategy does not have to have a lot of elements in it, just a few right ones will do. Not only prioritizing resources but the measures that will prepare one for any event. If I would change the game in any way it would be in the different types of catastrophes that can affect the project, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, heavy rain ect. I would leave the same geographical location for constructing the infrastructure, also I would limit the amount of measures that can be taken after increasing the different things that can be done to prevent a catastrophe. I would expande the research tool to be used on varios factors in the game, in order to make decision making much more challenging and resource managing even Â more so. Probably the thing that I would like to add but find difficult, would be human interaction as a form of risk management, like a lawsuit, an accident or shareholder disagreements. A bit complex but those are factors that arise when taking on a task, people as a a source of risk. Not to be negative but it is a real life dilema and learning how to deal with it is something that is not taught in most schools. This factor would make the game more complicated and would not make the player rely to much on the measures of probability and possibility. Relying only on numbers and equations is not enough for good risk management, they are important but relying only on them allows for tunneled vision of the environment one is in."80.188.69.40,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"This game was created in order to see how right risk management could save the city. It was based on decision-making process where Courserians should consider knowledge of risk, protection and insurance. We also had to find some equilibrium or trade-off between these principles, maintain it among levels and tried to be prepared for potential disaster. If this strategy was strictly maintained, we could reach higher kevel of the game.Considering the influence of number of games played, I have to agree that every time I lost the game I tried not to do the same mistake in the next game. And I learned one thing: ""Do not be nervous about approaching asteroid but try to identify the threats, determine risk rising from that threat and find ways to reduce it.""In my opinion, I find the game very well-designed in terms of acquiring basic knowledge about risk management. Maybe it would be more beneficial if there was more than one threat (fall of asteroid). The threat was differentiated just in the severity, not in variety. It would bring near the reality since we face a large number of threats every day."98.190.168.27,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The gamereally showed the impacts of knowing how to balance protection and growth whenone is handling risk management for a settlement such as the simulation withinthe game. Without a good balance and knowing how much of each one needs tofocus and not tipping the scales, the city would not grow or get completelydestroyed before the city can truly reach its growth potential. There wereseveral things I learned in the game about risk and development but the biggestone was that one needs to know that growth sometimes needs to be put on astandstill when the risk is too high for safety. Knowing that a comet was aboutto hit the city and create major collateral damage or when there is noinsurance at the moment creates a point of fear in myself and probably thepeople of the settlement. Insurance in particular always took priority in thebeginning of every level as well as protection so one would know that the cityis protected to a point where, if a comet were to hit the settlement, the citywould not be destroyed to a point where the funds will not come in time to fixall the damages. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The firsttime around I did not realize how big of a deal research was in making sure thecity was safe. Research was more than just seeing when the comet was coming. Itwould say what is a good level to have in terms of protection as well ascreates research levels to get outside help. Knowing when to get this researchis a big deal also. I would not do it if I needed to build stuff or increaseprotection but if I was waiting for more revenue to come in I would wait formore research particularly with a comet I knew was going to be severe sincewhen it did hit the settlement I had tons of help to increase the protectionand keep the settlement safe. It really showed what a big deal internationalaid does when preparing for a disaster. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Protectionalso seemed to not be as big of a deal after a certain tipping point. Once at acertain level, using the money for protection is more of a waste and can beused to grow the city. However, insurance was always a huge deal. Basicallywhenever I did not do insurance at the very beginning and even waiting forenough money to come in to buy the insurance before growing the city, the citywould be destroyed to a point of no return. It really shows the power of havinga good insurance plan for cities and for life in general. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If I wereto change the game, I would probably add permanent protection in the game suchas walls that one would built rather than raising the land. The walls could bedamaged and protection seemed kind of a nuisance in the game rather than inreality where they would be built from the ground up such as in New Orleans andwould be built higher and higher as the water was more likely to hit. "136.234.56.129,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"Â  We were tasked to play a game which had an objective of risk management. Â I was expected to determine where to allocate funds in order to develop the ""country."" Â The risks presented were comets coming at the country. Â I chose most often to protect the country and insure it against natural disaster. Â By doing this, I was unable to develop the country to it's capacity. Â I made fewer pods and did not develop the pods to a higher level. Â I did, however, protect the country from a great deal of damage from comets. Â Initially, protecting against losses was easier because developing a small country took less resources. Â After a while, however, it became more difficult to protect the country while maintaining a steady development due to the increased resources development was taking.Â  I played the game a couple of times to try to better understand the concepts and functions.

Â I did find it most valuable to have the country insured against the comets. Â The first time I played I did not protect enough at the beginning, which I am starting to believe is where it is most beneficial to develop your protection. Â I mostly learned that there is a balance to be achieved between development, insurance, and protection when managing a country. Â If you put too many of your resources into one of those three areas, you will not be able to survive a natural disaster. Â I also learned that it was impossible to predict when natural disaster might occur, and sometimes you can be over-prepared and lose an opportunity to develop the country.Â  If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would change one simple thing. Â I would allow for more opportunity to research the comets. Â By having greater opportunity for research, I could better determine where my resources are needed. Â At times during the game I over-insured or over-protected, simply because I did not know enough about the comet and what risks it presented. Â In order for the game to better reflect where I live, I would change the comets to tornadoes and the pods into neighborhoods.

Thegame involved risk management lessons as there was a need to build capacity to preparefor the impending shocks so that they can be tackled in an efficientmanner.Â  The various interlinked factorsof risk management were effectively represented in the game, which gave a reallife experience. I confronted trade-offs to development, as represented by developmentbar, in the form of resources- both time and money, which had to be spent onresearch, protection and insurance instead developing new pods or upgrading oldones. Constrained by both time and money, the rate of development of pods wasslowed due to diversification of these resources to prepare for shocks. The benefitsof being well prepared did exceed costs though, the right amount of research,insurance and protection- all helped in coping with shocks in a very efficientmanner. Frankly, it took me a couple of attempts to understand thegame and to design a strategy involving decisions on the major trade-offs Ifaced. The risk management lessons and examples I learnt from the videolectures came to use as I identified various provisions in the game to factorslike knowledge, protection and insurance. My behaviour towards these provisionsalso changed, as I understood their role in developing the community bymanaging imminent shocks. I was able to manage all the different provisions ina smarter manner, which helped me reach the development milestones within thetime which was provided. Like any role playing game, Risk Horizon also involvedmanaging multiple features, with each action having consequences and no provisionof going back. A couple of times I even paused the game to decide my next stepby looking at the level of severity and probability of a comet attack. The game has been successful in capturing various aspects ofrisk management.

Always you must make a decision, an option and seekÂ a rational equilibrium between different composite of resources after an informal cost - benefit analysis. Learning from the gameAt the beginning, I relied on my capabilities and knowledge but failed. After several attempts, my knowledge grew, but if you donÂ´t make use of it, then return again to level 1. Then I began to study intensely the comets, its data (severity of impact, likelihood of impact) and the impact to insurance cost. Additionally, I taughtÂ  to manage scarce money and try assign itÂ rationally between buying insurance policy and/orÂ getting up the protection. Â Time and moneyÂ resources and its management represent a key issue.Â Meanwhile time going on,Â I must thinking not under aÂ inmediate shock but future perspective. We need doing some kind of investment (protection, etc). No matter the first comet.Â Whichever nextÂ are important, too. I observed that the first levels (1,2 and 3 indeed), factor protection is necessary and less insurance. If weÂ´ll get advancedÂ up game, the relative position compared protection is more reasonable. Without forgetting, the more knowledge, less insurance is necessary. As insurance as protection, bothÂ are not cheap. Up level,Â cost gets up. In theory, the more research, more relations and links with other communities. So,Â itÂ´s useful whenÂ you needÂ to repairÂ yourÂ houses. But, if you overdo in any resource, just then, the meter gets into red and the development is getting down again.Â Resilience down??Â  If anyone promote the development in a quickly mood or style, failure will come, because it needs to be more assured and if your insurance coverage is limited, again bad situation. We donÂ´t know the next shot, itsÂ potential danger. So, we are to protect us. But if you protect too muchÂ for tinyÂ potential damage,Â money will fall down for constructing moreÂ development. ItÂ´s key to discover the balance between resources. From level 3 or 4 to take more consideration to insurance resource, I think itÂ´s important because we must support, defend what weÂ´ve already got it. Of course itÂ´s unthinkable if we havenÂ´t handle appropiately protection and knowledge before.So,Â one fact I also taught was to upgrade the community, securing itÂ but gradually, stepping.Â If the research is fruitful, then severity downgrade.

Firstly, risk management involvestradeoffs. WhileÂ  protection enhances the capacity to mitigate the impactof future disasters (elevating the island tantamount to creating Â wealth),Â it also has itsÂ Â downsidewhich is Â  reflected in having less time to spin the comet off its destructivesea-bound path. It also means that the higher one elevates the island, the moreexpensive insurance becomes (reflected in the cost of any repairing the damagedpods). This is because at lower level of the island insurance costs less thanwhen the island is elevated. Â That said, early preparations andprotectionÂ  allow the player time to acquire knowledge through research(more time to focus on spinning the comet up the sky). What I also found outduring my second attempt was that If I bought sufficient insurance and raisedthe island to a certain height, it took sometime before comets emerged, whichmeant that I had more time to develop the island. I played the game twice, and for sure I found it scintillating butchallenging all the same. This is because the game gives the player a glimpseat what it takes to tackle risk. While protection as manifested in elevatingÂ  the island enhances the capacity to mitigateloss in the event of Â future disasters, Â protection by itself is insufficient to doaway with loss entirely without buying Â insurance Â protection that reduces the Â cost of damages, albeit mitigated. In otherwords, Â eradicating the destruction fromfuture Â disasters is not possible letalone feasible, Â rather risk managementshould be done through proactive measures Â (preparations knowledge acquisition, protectionand buying insurance). Â I noticed thatthe interface changed during my second attempt. During my first attempt, as faras I can recall, the message on how much I gained by protecting theisland(elevating it), was a lump sumÂ  figure as was the amount of money Ispent during my repairs and research work. However, during my second messagespertaining to those aforementioned issues popped up as I engaged in theactivity.The first time I played the game, I got so messed up that I almost gave up.However, with time I realized I had to develop some strategies right from theoutset. Â I realized that raising the island, provides the player withresourcesÂ  and saves on the insurance premiums initially, allows more timeto undertakeÂ  development, acquisition ofknowledge, that bolsters preservation and social capital harnessing(relationships). However, overtime Insurance cost rises, with the implicationthat cost of damages soars substantially. One takeaway:Â not to deprive vitalresources for future development , investment Â in Â protectionand insurance should be early and at just sufficient level. Moreover, insuranceshould be bought early before premiums surge once a disaster strikes, savingample time to acquire researchÂ knowledge that hastens developmentcapabilities.What I would add, or enhance is the feature that shows underscores theimportance of Â collective effort (socialcapital) in preparing Â for disasters, mitigatingsuffering or losses in the wake of disasters, and recovery from disasters.Social capital increases societal Â awareness of the potential loss from futuredisasters, fosters capacity building through information creation, updating andsharing on potential disaster Â cost, Â possible ways to protect individuallivelihoods (solidarity), reduces the burden of Â rehabilitation and reconstruction efforts. Addinga feature that highlights the importance of bridging and linking social capitalcan make the game more realistic. Â Itcould also be better if a feature that underscored the importance of learning(acquired knowledge is not easily lost but becomes an asset is bequeathed tofuture generations.Â  "197.255.119.28,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"1) The role of risk management in the game was to use knowledge (research) protection and insurance to protect the development (building and upgrading pods) take into consideration resources (time and money). I made a lot of choices from balance among risk management tools (using them with the same priority), choose not to buy insurance and increase my protection, choose to sacrifice the development or to stop the development using money to increase risk management by buying knowledge or increase protection or buy best insurance to take risk of shock missing. Each strategy in the game has a cost so sometime you can buy insurance and at the end you do not use it or increase unnecessary your protection or build pods but with weak risk management and at the end the shock will come and destroy them. Â The preparation for the risk affect the development at any stage and especially in the medium term( after some time). 2) I played the game more than once, for the first time I did not have good knowledge about the development (update of pods) and research. I was wasting too much time in research). The second time I reduced the time allocated for research and increase a bit my wealth.

My suggestion is that we can first Â distinguish the type of shock such as drought, flood, job, etc. second develop a combination of different risk management strategies that fit well with the shock ( in which the player will have to provide his choice depending on the shock) then after that we can introduce the severity of the shock so that the player can use his wisdom to determine the type of insurance to buy, the level of production and the type of pod to develop ( the type of pod now can be related to the type of predominant or regular shock).

Concretely, you had toprevent as well cope with the consequences of a natural disaster, namely thecrashing of meteorites, while building and developing a sustainable community.For that purpose, you had to compose with protection, effective building,different insurance bundles, and research.I had toconfront constant trade-offs between all those components as privileging onlyone of them, whichever it was, led to a deadend.Â After some time, preparationfor risk induced less damage from meteorite crashings and more rapid additionaloverall preparation degree.I playedthe game many times. I especially learnt how to adapt the research level for eachmeteorite in regard to its potential impact, and to focus good enough oncommunity development as an asset in itself. I also learnt that the maximaldegree of insurance taken from the beginning was not a valid option as it costmoney that was essential to a sufficient level of community building at the start in order to pass the levels.What Iespecially learnt: how to adapt systematic research to coming potentialdisasters and adapt it both to its potential level of impact and its actualchance of occurring, without neglecting that research can take time that ishard to evaluate, and that it protects most of the time, yet not every time. Ihad to remember how important community building AND community development arekey. I also had to consider this last double aspect as a partial efficient substitutefor individual insurance. Last, I had to consider how lessons from the past areessential yet do not immunize against new coming disasters by themselves, asadditional research and circumstantial adaptation are necessary as well and all need time, energy, and a lot of attention. I first disliked then liked the game.I live inFrance. I think a positive improvement of the game could lie in a more detailedemphasis on the necessity of building communities, as we are a societyindividualized to a high degree in my country. For example, in the case of job unemployment, whichstays among causes of disaster exposed in the course, the loneliness of thejobless is impacting very dramatically their health, their perspectives ofgetting a job again, and their economic and family situation. Thus, there couldbe two components instead of only one to represent community building in thegame, the additional element being explicitly linked to human interconnectionsand interactions, through daily communication, learning, freely each-other-assisting."73.178.244.42,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Risk Horizon CfbQ8TJÂ The simulation does give the sense of unpredictable urgency and intenseresource management. There were times when no matter the preparation, I wasoften decimated by severe impacts. It has taught me an important lesson beyondprepare for the worst and hope for the best. I has taught me to anticipatepotential disasters and to prioritize projects. Â When I began my colony in Risk Management, I built three pods immediatelyand purchased Tier 1 insurance in case of damages. I continued expanding untilI colonized all of the available land. Â I continued upgrading my structures one at a time. I was half way throughthe upgrade of my third tower when a meteor struck damaging most of mystructures. The insurance helped reduce the time and cost of repairs. Â I raised the elevation two bars. This did cause a delay in my progress. Iissued repairs and upgrades. A medium severity meteor crashed, causingfifty-percent damage to colony. This was a devastating blow as I raced againstthe clock. I issued more repairs and watched yet another medium severity meteorstrike. I went from nearly reaching my goal to falling to half way. Fearing forthe loss of my colony, I chose not to elevate the plateau to avoid delaying thereconstruction efforts. I managed to upgrade all of my structures to tier fourand purchased additional insurance to help protect my investments. Â Only a third of my pods had fully recovered from the last wave. As theclocked ticked closer and closer to the end of the round, I saw that my chancesof survival were slimming. Much to my dismay, I saw three meteors in the sky. Iclicked on them for research. Every single one had an eighty percent chance tohit with approximately a ninety-five percent severity. I knew right then andthere I would not make it. Ultimately, my colony was lost.Â I was frustrated; I felt that I was dealt a very bad hand. In that moment,however, I realized that this was what happened in the real world. All toofrequently, natural disasters all too frequently have little early warning. Preparation,insurance, elevation, all of it can easily be washed away by a series ofunfortunate turn of events. Â I tried again. My second attempt, I first began by raising the elevation byfour bars. I felt this to be the safest way to begin as I was far above the sealevel. My expectation was that this would reduce the overall potential damageshould a meteor strike. Immediately afterward, I set out constructing more pods.I upgraded pods as quickly as funds became available. After each pod upgraded, Icontinued elevating the plateau higher. I finished constructing all of my podsand fully half of them were tier two. Â Idid not purchase insurance beyond Tier 1 as many meteors missed my colonybecause I felt my colony was sufficiently high above the water level.Â I was constantly checking the status of meteors. I would only raise theelevation for impacts with a high chance to hit. I managed to survive the firstthrough rounds without trouble. Naturally, as I progressed, more and moremeteors continued to assault my colony. The first impact affected approximatelyten percent of my structures. I was able to recover from that.Â A very severeasteroid struck that demolished my colony with close to seventy percent damage.Once again, I knew I was out of the match. I saw my progress bar plunge to thebottom and waited for the time to run out. "195.67.195.9,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"I played the game many times not makingit pass level 3. I tried many different strategies frombuilding all pods in level 1 to having minimum pods with highupgrades in level 1 (fancy structures and trees). Knowledge addedmore wealth than protection. Insurance was necessary; I did not makeit pass a level without insurance. I always purchased the highestinsurance plan. I quickly noticed there was a balance between addingupgrades and increasing protection. It was pointless to have highprotection without upgrades or visa versa. Upgrades were costly torepair, sometimes my wealth was insufficient to cover the repaircost. So, I had to increase my wealth through knowledge before thenext comet collision.  Rebuilding required time. I had to constantly check my wealth making sure I can maintain the existing pods (with upgrades) before I could build new pods.Â  Knowledge wascorrelated to the time you had to develop the community connection (the flashing lights).The community connection patterns I did not understand; I assume itwas random. At the end, it determine the severity of the impact. Theseverity effected the development meter. How quickly it turned fromgreen to red!!! Do have have sufficient wealth to cover the all the repairs at once or do have to repair over time.Â  The take home message: A balance existbetween knowledge, insurance and protection. At the beginning it isdifficult to establish the balance. In the beginning you may havemore access to knowledge than protection. Knowledge tells you whattype of protection your need. Eventually, there will be a need forinsurance.  In reality, there is no set order in what comes firstknowledge, insurance or protection; all are required. In some waysknowledge, protection and insurance are depended on each other,without one they other two are useless. Over time, balance will beachieved between the three. When knowledge is increased, protectionand insurace most increase also, but not at the same rate. It isinterested how wealth plays into the risk management equation. In thegame knowledge and protection added wealth to community, but realityknowledge (acquiring/research) and protection (providing) can reducea community wealth.  Only in the longterm does protection andknowledge become cost effective. Community wealth is difficult tomanage and balance, always having sufficient funds to cover dailycost (without risk), yet have surplus money to cover the repairs froma natural disaster, disease or food/water shortage.  Community wealthis key piece in risk management. Communities having financialinvestors and/or access to markets, will help people survive alltypes of events from covering basic daily cost to severities cause bynatural disasters. Wealth also helps coping with a disaster and preparing for future shocks.New game version: Buildings locatedfarther from the cliff (shore edge) should have different pricing forrepairs and cost for building. Geographical location influences building and repair prices for protection and insurance. Add more ways to increase wealth for example access to an investor or a market,besides knowledge or protection, to have moremoney for repairs and building. It is difficult repair or build without wealth. "177.159.167.229,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,30.0 to 33.0,-15.0 to 1.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"Gamecode:Â bAG7rZ8Risk management is all aboutcollecting information, as was in the game. Once you are sure about thepossible damage you can expect, youâ€™ll be able to use your resources wisely, tomatch the possible outcome and minimize losses. You start to go further in thegame when you realize that focusing in research to find out the chance of hit and possible damage is way cheaper than expend all your money on a ultra-hi-tech not needed security and insurance. Itâ€™s important to match your defensivesystem to the size of the threat you'll face; building the â€œbest defensive systemever madeâ€ù may be way worse than a very simple that matches the specificneed. Why would you build a 3 meter wall if you only wants to stop your neighbor dog from enter your yard and eat your journal? You will be expendingmoney and time on something that could be solved by just talking to your neighbor about theproblem, or just building a wood fence, or buying a mailbox. The importantpoint is to match your needs, save precious resources, and apply them on otherthings that are really important.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  To do this, you'll needInformation, and information is key on risk management. Accurate, reliable, updatedinformation. Bad information can be many times worse than no information at all.Knowing you donâ€™t know something will make you search for it or adopt a secureroute, just to be sure. Having bad information will make you believe that what youare doing is the right thing. You might end expending a lot more money and timeon something that might never be used or even worse, when it actually happen,it will not work and people will be confident that they are safe, whenthey are not.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Last year, onBrazil, a fire in a nightclub killed more than 240 people that thought wheresafe, but when the crisis striked all systems failed and they are dead now. Whenyou go to a place you think you are safe, because at least in theory, youshould be, or the place shouldnâ€™t be open. Thatâ€™s just one example of how bad information can endangerpeople.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The outcome of having reliable, usefuland updated information is to have the certainty of how much money you need toexpend and how much money you can save for investments or others purposes. Whenthe subject is money is all about finding the right amount to do what you need,no more, no less. Expending just the right amount will allow you to use thatentire amount that would be expended unnecessarily, on useful things.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  It will happen, in certainsituations, where you just donâ€™t have the money or for some reason the expenseis so high to prevent the situation that it will be cheaper to let it happen â€“if it happen â€“ and fix the damage afterwards. For those situations there are insurance, you pay for it, and when the crisis strikes you are protected, atleast financially. Having insurance allows people to take more risks, becausethey feel safe, the same way of having any other system that guarantee theywill make it through.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  All of three have their own role andare important to outcome adversity when it happens. It is up for the riskmanager to make the balance between them and chose the right one on eachsituation. But undoubtedly information is the first thing to be taken inconsideration, reliable, accurate and updated information, to guide everyone onthe right way.Guilherme Thomas"219.110.251.207,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"First of all, this game is really great to know how research, preparation and insurance are important.ã€€Thanks for giving this opportunity.Related to 1.Â -This game requires the development of our community in Alora land. But some comets attack the land and destroy our facilities so that we have to prevent from those disasters. There is cost constrain between the development and the preparation. We have to consider the balance how to spend our money to develop our community with lowest damage from comets.Â -I confronted which I should spend first. e.g. If I develop our community first, I could not buy a good insurance due to lack of money. If I spend a lot of money for preparation, the speed of development will be slow. Timing was also very important.-At first, I tried to buy good insurance before start developing our community as I know comets attack several times with high possibility. Next, I researched to analyze how dangerous the comets coming to the land.When comets came close to the land, I tried to raise the height of the land.I could not avoid any damage completely but my insurance covered the recovery cost minimum. Â  Â  Â Related to 2.-If I try once, I will be more cautious to avoid any damage but if I could try several times, I will repeat trial and error to look for the best scenario to achieve building ideal community. This is the game to learn risk so that I thought prevention was important but I have learned that too much preparation would not be best way. The balance of developing and cost is important. At the same time, the timing of preparation is also important.Related to 3.-If I am tasked with developing new version, I will make several kinds of risk from small fires to big earthquakes with possibilities. Depends on the risks and possibilities, our way of preparation will change. - I live in Japan. In March 11th, 2011, we had an experience of big earthquake and big tsunami. Japan has been experiencing big earth quakes several times so that the damage from the earthquake was very limited despite of huge magnitude. But many people died due to big tsunami and Fukushima daiichi nuclear plants were destroyed. Big tsunami was not unprecedented event. There were several big tsunami attacked those regions every 60 to 70 years. You can find some makers warned about big tsunami attacked there made by those people who had experienced long time ago. The scale of risk and the possibility of risk are two main factors to evaluate how to deal with. How to prepare from the rare events would occur every 60 to 70 years but the scale of damage is huge if once occur should be kept thinking.Â  ã€€ Â  Â Â "14.139.196.3,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk managementis the term applied to a logical and systematic method of establishing thecontext, identifying, analyzing, evaluating, treating, monitoring andcommunicating risks associated with any activity, function or process in a waythat will enable organizations to minimize losses and maximize opportunities. RiskManagement is also described as 'all the things you need to do to make thefuture sufficiently certain'.In context of thegame,game shows the point by point relation between various institutionsÂ  in reference to a disaster of falling cometsfrom sky of varying hitting probability and severity Â . The role of riskmanagement in the game was to successfully balance the four main key elementsnamely Protection,insurance,research and the most important one development growth which included setting up of pods(like industsries of a country)and upgrading them from time to time.Â Protection level indicators included how high our island was from theground and the number of luminated blocks of in the meter. Research methods wasby hovering the pointer over the falling comets and gaining knowledge aboutthem whereas research which was the most effective tool in risk managementhelped counter the losses in the game,and alongwith reaching to the criticallevel of required development in the given timeframe.Choices andtrad-offs included taking risk after getting insured. In the whole game ,theincome or the cash in hand is the most affective factor towards Â decision of choosing in between 4 elements ofrisk management i.e. which one to empowered the most. The most effective methodfound was to get insured and get going with the process of development withbalanced investment on research and protection. I found the insurance andÂ  development the most effective thenprotection and then research.Although giving less attention on protection and researchis not a good idea but at the same time winning the game was the ultimate goalso we have to make tough choices.Â Preparation forrisk affects development in ways that it helps the community to resist theshocks well,and if at all any losses are caused coping them at minimum cost(viainsurance) and the given timeframe so as to bring back the pods in thereoriginal condition.Â In the initialphase investing more on one pod rather than setting up new pods was aÂ  mistake that needs to be corrected while playingthe game again since it takes more time and cash to upgrade the system ratherthen setting up new systems and getting started to generate revenues frominvestment. And the Â most importantcorrection is to take insurance plan as soon as possible, because once hit by asevere comet it becomes almost impossible to do a come back in game if you donâ€™thave insurance. Â Â If there arises aneed to create a new version of the game :the most annoying Â thing i found upgrading research ,why there isa need to stop ourselves while doing research upgradation.In the new version iwould be introducing a cash flow button for research i.e. when to allow cashflow Â in research and when not to.

The role of risk management was decide when/how much to develop with the threat of the comets and the consequences of the comments. In terms of choices, I decided to research the level of severity and to then build up adequate protection. I would only purchase insurance if there were a large amount of high-severity comets in the horizon. Preparing for risk certainly impeded development. If the comets were particularly severe, it did not make sense to further develop some pods or even create others, as the amount of protection/resources needed would out-weight the benefits of development. This however, impacted the development goal, which lead to its ultimate failure. It demonstrated that even though you may have all of the tools, knowledge, and resources available, it cannot always lead to success if the threat is too large and varied.Â 2. I played the game more than once and I kept making mistakes (although different ones) at critical points. When building up too much protection, I may have had money, but I still failed to reach the development goal. When developing at a faster rate, I sustained more and more expensive damages. If I spent too much time on research, I was spending enough time on protection or development. While it was easier to succeed in the early levels, it was much harder to maintain a good balance of protection, research, and development in the later levels. If I played it again, I think I would try different balances of those three aspects. In a way, this is an interesting way to experiment, as you would not have this ability in the real world. There is no 'restart' when discussing real people, disasters, and communities, which demonstrates the high-level stakes those involved with international development deal with on a daily basis.Â 3. I would propose an ""ask for help"" button. This would mean that a certain amount of money (there could be degrees, such as with the insurance) would be go to an outside group. In return you could choose for 'outside research', 'outside development', or 'outside protection'. However, you do not get a say in how it is applied. Thus, the 'outside development' could develop pods further or it would just create new pods. 'Outside research' would either perform long research on one comet or short research on several comets, and 'outside protection', would raise to be just enough protection or too much. These would have an effect on your continued actions in the game. I think this would reflect how outside help can sometimes work in real life situations. The places that need research/development/protection cannot always do it themselves and have to hire others, but as a result, they do not always get to decided how it will be done, whether it is for the better or worse. In each case, it would be a gamble if it would help you progress to the next level or not, which is how it is in real life.Â "210.6.85.89,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Whatwas the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and whattrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or aftersome time)?Therole of risk management seemed to be applying a trade-off of knowledge,protection and insurance. The relationship between the three was ambiguous.Insurance was the easiest tool to apply and seemed to be worth hit given thefrequency of comets and the damage they caused. The fact that insurance lapsedautomatically when the level changed was a problem and had to be found out by trialand error. It was also a problem that I could not upgrade my insurance during alevel once I had more funds.Togain knowledge I tried to build large numbers of level one pods but only got tolevel 2. Then I tried building a few pods and put them up to higher levels.This did not get me past level 2 either.Idid not understand the protection tool at all. Sometimes it seemed to help getthe land higher but at others it did nothing. There was no feedback as to why.Preparingfor risk affected development. If there was a comet in the sky a decision hadto be made to upgrade now or wait to see what it would do first. I took thepath that it is better to get on with things than wait around. This may havebeen a factor as to why I did not get past level 2.If you played the game onlyonce, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you dodifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned fromthe game?Iplayed the game three times before I got bored and frustrated with the appallingmusic. I varied the amount of pods I had and varied the speed in which Iupgraded them. In one game I had one pod up to high levels while in another Ihad lots of pods at low levels and in another I had a few pods at mid-levels ofdevelopment. None of these option got me past level 2.The game captures, in asimplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked withdeveloping a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add onesimple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk managementchoices that matter in the place you live?I live in Hong Kong whichis a wealthy city with lots of risk management practices and infrastructure inplace. We are most at risk from flooding from heavy tropical storms andtyphoons. The drainage system is well built and maintained and there is aconstant reminder to citizens not to block them with rubbish and waste.Drainage not only keeps the low levels of the city (and its underground railwaysystem) dry, it also minimises the danger of high flow water coming down fromthe sheer mountains that the city is built around.HongKong is at risk from rising sea levels. Hong Kong island and Kowloon areprotected in a large part by sea walls. But if the sea levels above the levelsof the storm water drainage this water will not be able to flow into the harborduring storms and this will cause flooding. I am unsure what to recommend tomitigate this risk other than to advocate all the options of CO2 reduction thatwill reduce the melting of the polar icecaps."212.88.98.35,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of riskmanagementÂ inthe game I learnt how to plan and draw strategies that can give you someresilience because with the resources (pods and the island) available you planfor them equitably.Knowledge,here you are tasked to carry out research especially on comets look at severityand the impact that it might have on the investments on the ground in this caseprotecting, my podsÂ .

It was difficult at first to recognize what defenses worked best against different types of comets with different risks of impact. In particular, I believe that I spent too much of my resources purchasing insurance, and not enough time doing research on the comets. When I adjusted my strategy later in the game, my results were better.2. I spent a lot more time doing research the second time I played. I didn't realize at first the impact that it had on mitigating the effects of the comets.3. I would add the opportunity to add other mitigation features to individual pods that have more importance, and that require bigger investments.

What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The very important thing in the game is the decision making. You should evaluate what are the best decisions you could take to get to development in the planet and win theÂ level each time. I found risk management and the economic concept of â€œopportunity costâ€ù very seemed. The opportunity cost is what you are willing to lose when taking a decision. For example, if a very strong meteor is coming and itâ€™s very likely that it will hit my pods, I would prefer purchasing insurance or protecting my pods by raising them than upgrading them or creating new ones, because what I could lose is much bigger than what I could gain upgrading or creating some pods. So, using the knowledge (information) you have and the resources you can afford, you can evaluate what will be the best decision, this is the principal key in the game and I think thatâ€™s what risk management is about. I faced many situations in the game where I had to protect or purchase insurance when a very strong meteor was just about to hit my planet, but it was worth it because what I would have lost if I didnâ€™t do that would have been much bigger than what I would gain if I wouldâ€™ve upgraded my pods. I used to get a lot of protection even if there were no meteors because it was very likely and almost inevitable that at any moment a destructive meteor could hit my planet, so, that affected development after some time, but when I upgraded or created new pods I noticed that my wealth increased a lot faster, so that would affect development immediately.2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I played it many times. The first time care about protection or insuranceÂ and didn't care too much about research and evaluate the impacts of meteors, losing a lot of resources and loss developmentÂ . Obviously thatÂ wasn't a good decision. Them I adapt to every circumstances an create strategy's to achieve win the game.Â 3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I will suggest the possibility of anothers form of insurance will be fun in the making of strategys. Other thing that I really change for better is more information about wealth generator of pots and upgrades of insurance, research's."92.55.107.197,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"While I found the game quite interesting and addictive, I didn't see quite as much risk management in it as I had expected. I expected more focus to be placed on issues such as insurance and mitigation. That being said, however, after having played the game several times, I realized that the focus should be on development, while keeping research and protection under control. During my first few games, i mainly focused on risk prevention, rather than on developing the buildings and doing research. During the last, winning, game, i focused more on development, while also ensuring that I am protected enough against possible risks. For instance, during this last game, I never even had to buy insurance. I simply did not need it, since my buildings were all at the latest development stage, with ground was high enough not to be damaged by the meteorite impact, and my research gave me pretty accurate information on what was to come. So, preparation for risk did affect development when i focused mainly on risk prevention. However, once I have found a balance between development and mitigation, I had no problem keeping everything in check. The lesson I can find in all this is that development cannot do without risk management and vice versa.Â If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would bring two changes to the game. First, I would add some other potential risks - thus making the players have to decide which hazards should take precedence and thus learning that most threats usually do not come alone. Secondly, I would like to enhance the community communication aspect of the game. I believe that pre, during and post communication is vital to proper risk management.Â "138.246.2.41,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 17.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"The role of the risk management in the game was to build up sustainable village community. The houses had to be upgraded in order to reach higher profit, but at the same time the island had to be protected against natural disasters. I tried to evaluate the risk of each comet by reaching minimal research level. If the possibility of damage was low, I invested my resources into upgrading Â houses or building new ones. It does take some time, so until new resources were generated, I came back to research of the comet, in order to gain time for making connections (this seems to be the easiest way of protection, since it doesn`t cost any resources. If the the probability of damage was high, I spend the resources on insurance and raising the island. In that case, the preparation for the risk was delaying the development.When I played the game the first time, I didn`t pay much attention into research. I build up massive protection, but then the resources were missing elsewhere and the growth of the village decreased. The second mistake I made, was investing too much money to upgrade the houses, but I was not building new ones.Then their maintenance become costly after catastrophe, and it took a long time to ""regenerate"" from the economical point of view. The main thing I learned from the game would be the necessity of balance. It is impossible to focus on one or two aspects, but the development has to approached in complex way.If I should change something in the game, I would add a measurement of the income speed of houses. Like this it is difficult to evaluate and compare the options for building new houses or developing existing ones.

A reasonable assessment of the failure to pass round 4 can be ascribed to excessive use of risk management techniques. The costs of risk management for the writer have exceeded the benefits gained from these techniques and drained precious resources, which could, therefore, not be accumulated fast enough to pass round 4. The writer used both preventive measure and risk transfer measures to offset comet risk, investing heavily into raising the level of the pod village and purchasing, initially, level 1 insurance, which was eventually upgraded to level 2 insurance. The excessive risk prevention and mitigation (transfer) costs have drained cashflow from the pod village and resulted in a loss during level 4 of the game, as the costs of risk management, which had decreasing marginal returns per dollar spent, exceeded the returns and thus resulted in missed investment opportunities (the opportunity cost of investing into risk management was decreased/slower investment into building/improving/upgrading the village. The lesson learnt for the future is not to skimp on risk management expenditure, but to delay some of the expenditure, so that it can be invested into growth, until the asset values reach a level, where investment into additional risk management provides a benefit that exceeds the value at risk times the probability of the risk occurring. "46.109.84.109,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. Well, while risk management did matter in the game on some level (pun intended), overall it really didn't. Â For me it was too heavily dependant on randomness (from now on RNG). Either that or I'm simply terrible at the game. Didn't get past level 4. You have to heavily focus onÂ development to get anywhere. I found out the hard wayÂ Â that you need to heavily invest in protection as wellÂ and use insurance only as needed. Insurance almost always served as the last resort, when things were going south. What I learned and the game conveysÂ really wellÂ is that not preparing, be it protection, insurance or research, can set you back Â byÂ a lot. Which is one of the key points to take away, I think.Â Nevertheless, I got angry at the game pretty fast. First of all for not saving any of my previous scores, and then for not being really friendly with my ungodly wrist pain. Click click click click.Â 2. Differently than the first time? Everything. Tried to heavily invest in protection, then insurance and research. Then I tried out different combinations. To get past the level 2, you need good management. To get past level 3, you need good RNG. What did I learn? Well, nothing I already didn't know - RNG is a b*tch and universe is completely indifferent about how many nicely looking things you have built or how far have you come in your development. So could you get hit by a bus tomorrow. Just like anybody else. So better be protected, err... prepared. While in the game insurance won't do you much, in real life it can be quite a bit more useful, especially in some places of residence.Â 3.

Universe is indifferent and doesn't care about you nor your level of preparedness.Â For me game was frustrating, and too heavily dependent on RNG.Â To fill in the rest , I would like to ponder over some things.

This is what the game symbolizes and makes us realize the importance of the Risk management. Development Â for a nation or an entity needs research which in turn is dependent on technology which also is based on the resources. A developing nation or community cannot plan to focus on research avenues available for development mainly because of high investments. After surpassing the initial stage, resources can be utilized and invested in research avenues.Â On the whole, the game paid importance to between the growth in development percentage and the level of the ground barrier to be made. Also the research was essential for the community development and overcome the losses occurred during the period. The more time spent on each , the more data gets gathered. Planning and preparation towards research enables the community to showcase better communication and quicker rehabilitation. An arena which needs to be developed, also needs better communication network. For example Disaster Management Devices need to be used in disaster prone areas to save humanity and life stock. A better insurance needed to cope up with losses and essential for minimum investment. Insurance provides a better outlook and more opportunities for development. An insured person can do more work and utilize better resources in better manner. A real truth is that shows that time and resources utilized.Â That resulted in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I kept some resources for research and preparedness also. Most important, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community.Â "114.143.138.47,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"To get more pods developed.Only focused on meteors and went on building/protecting.

It is our duty as ""The Luminator"", to help Alora develop and grow, while taking necessary precautions against the destruction wreaked by the Comets. We have at our disposal, the ability to ""research"" a comet, thus predicting more accurately, the dangers posed by it; we have the technology to physically raise our community so as to protect against the waves caused by the Comet strikes; and we have the option of buying insurance, to help pay for any damages.In short, we have a system where there's an interplay between knowledge (researching a comet, thus removing uncertainty of the threat), protection ('raising' the community, thus physically protecting from the adverse effects of a comet strike and roping in community involvement), insurance (buying insurance, thus spreading the costs of a comet strike over the insurance network) and coping (recovering from comet strikes), the fundamentals of risk management. Our aim is to mitigate risks as we strive to develop our community, essentially dividing resources (time and in-game cash) between development and risk management. The ambiguous nature of risk was exemplified in the game by the fact that the comet strikes were stochastic events and not completely determinate. Thus, it forces the player to deal with uncertain knowledge, and resort to hedging his/her bets on protection and insurance. Also, since protection gets carried over from one level to the next (unlike insurance), it was easy to see how protective measures taken at one time, contribute towards deflecting a huge threat at a much later time. For example, filling up the protection meter over the first two levels enables us to meet the really huge comet in level three. Of course, protection and insurance also helps us meet the immediate threats as well.I played the game multiple times, and soon realized that time is a precious commodity that must be properly managed. While I was researching a comet, I was not working on developing my pods, which often led to me failing a level. Thus, I started treating time as a scarce resource, which led to better game results. The lessons that I would take away from the game are that first of all, risk management is a balancing act. Tread too cautiously, and opportunities leave you behind. Focus only on opportunities without taking risks into consideration and you can get washed away. The split has to be just right. Secondly, I got a live example of how gamification can lead to better learning. Not only was I motivated to try and ace the game, I connected more with the theory by analogy with the game. Had there been a regular quiz, I would not have been so introspective of the principles of risk management, nor would the ramifications of protection and insurance be so apparent, as it is now.While the game is quite good with respect to the integrated storyline and the analogy that it provides with risk management, I feel the ""insurance"" feature of the game is not properly developed. Unlike protection, insurance does not carry over across levels, and one has to repurchase insurance at a much higher price in the succeeding level. In real life, this is not the case and insurance costs are more stable. If given a chance to redesign the game, I would change this so that insurance is more affordable (perhaps provide the option to buy with equal installments over a level)."197.253.9.29,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"I found the Risk Horizon game particularly interesting.At the level One of the game, I found that it was importantto begin building a community with the funds available, as without a community,there would in the first place be nothing to protect from unforeseeable events.The second most important thing to do right after thecommunity starts growing is to avoid possible disaster by investing in researchthat would prevent the strikes from the meteorsHowever chances are that the work done to prevent meteorstrikes might not be enough hence it is important to purchase insurance, sothat in the event that such happens and there is damage to the community, thecost of reconstruction is partly bourn by the insurance companyI observed that after spending a considerable sum, say4/5th, of resources in developing the community, the amount of money availableto purchase insurance and invest in research is reduced hence my community isless protected from a meteor strikeI did play the game a couple of times, at first I didn't putin enough effort into research and elevating the community to prevent damagefrom meteor strikes hence the community suffered damage each time there was ameteor strike.However at other times I realized I was upgrading thebuildings too fast, such that I was draining my resources to fast.

There was feedback between rounds about the trade off between characteristics of a risk (intensity and probability), level of preparation and damage. However this was not easy to interpret.

Even so, I couldn't get any further than level 4.Â  The main thing I learned from the game was to be aware of the trade-offs that exists, and to act fast, don't procrastinate, because when a problem happens, we have to have agility to solve the problems, and like the correct choice to make is usually not clear, we have to look the possibilities available and try to do the best choice and fast as we can, to minimize the losses if something goes wrong."37.46.244.193,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role or vital importance of risk management in the recommended game practically illustrated how to prepare against risk and properly coping with itâ€™s effects and moving on to the next chapter (in this case level).

The risk in this case (game) comet of different strength, intensity kept hitting on my pods, in some cases destroy them for example in one particular case 67% damage was made to them, I had to rebuild them and continue the game. What risk management has taught me is to carefully study each comet, no to presume or assume because surely itâ€™s going to the hit the pods and itâ€™s in my best interest to study them and understand them thereby looking for a possible outlet to the damage and in most cases no damage was sustained. No damage was sustained because I didnâ€™t allow the comet take me unawares, I saw it coming prepared for it and made the best out of it. Â After a particular damage on my first attempt playing the game my pods incurred a damage of about 67% and I was to rebuild it. I did that without and insurance and I had about 7 pods and had to do the reconstruction with about $200 each, it costed me a lot, instead of upgrading my pods I went back rebuilding what I had already. During the 2 trial I after building 3 pods I went for a 75% insurance package after which it wasnâ€™t long another comet damaged 50% of my pods at this time I had insurance and it didnâ€™t cost up to $21 to fix each of them, giving me enough balance to continue like nothing happened. At some point I had to go for a higher insurance plan just to big bigger pods and make sure if anything happens to them I can easily and comfortably rebuild them. In all when comets with greater chances of big impacts came around I knew I had to spend more preparing, because if I spent more preparing I wonâ€™t have to a lot in rebuilding after the impact.

Â This allows me to examine the use of realistic and cost-effective opportunities to balance retention programs like building and repairing pods in the community with 3 different types of commercial insurance against comet attacks. Â In the game, I tend to rebuild as many pods as I can to rebuild the community. Â As the game prolongs, I tend to buy higher insurance to protect against the potential loss of pods in the community. Â The success of the community is based upon the numbers and the health of the pods. Â So, my trade-offs were to repair less pods but buy higher insurances to protect existing pods as I play to get to level 2. Â  Although I made more progress each time, I could not get advanced to pass level 2. Â But, I made better choices as I understand the games better. Â  I think I was not able to advance to level 3 because I was lacking patience to examine all the angles of the game. Â However, I felt that I was making better choices each time as I understood the purpose of the game. I felt that preparation for risk with higher insurance allows me to make choices to either repair existing pods or make new pods. Â  It was difficult to do both at the same time as the resources are depleting rapidly as the comet attacks became more frequent. Â I played the games a few times, as I felt that I did not understand the game well. Â After the first time I played the game, I went back to the tutorial to better understand the game. Â I have learned that going back to the beginning allowed me to make better game plans between repairing pods and building more pods with higher insurance. Â As each time I played, I felt that I progressed more and more and made better choices probably because I understood the situation better and thus I was able to understand the decision of making trade-offs.

Â If I have to change the game, I propose to add one or more players in each game because choices are made through cooperation with different advisers in real life. Â Although it is important to have a leader to make difficult choices, it is wise to get as many advises from colleagues and experts to evaluate all the options.

The role of risk management is important in the game. This is because the aim of the game is to build up pods on a barren unpopulated island. However, the island is continuously subjected to the threat of comets. When the comets strike and hit on the island, the pods built will be damaged and the island will be scorched and turned uninhabitable.  So, ways must be thought out to build pods on the island on the one hand and protecting the buildings from the threat and damage done by the comets. Ways of protection will involve risk management.           The risk management involves a few basic steps and requirements. The first step is to do some research on the comets in the sky.  The power to look out into space and learn the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet will give some idea to the player whether to neglect the comet (with little chance of hitting) or step up protection for the comet (with high chance of hitting). Also, the longer you do the research on the comet, the higher chance for you to mitigate the effects of the hit after the comet strikes on the island. The second step is to do protection. If the slider on the bottom right of the screen is pressed and held into the upright position to raise your island. By matching the level of protection with the severity of the comet, one will prevent oneâ€™s pods from being damaged!The final step available is to obtain insurance for the pods built. The insurance policy must be carefully selected so that the smallest premium spent can offer enough protection against the comets striking.However, the preparation for risk will affect the development. When you do the research on the comet, the development will be halted. When you uplift the slider on the bottom right, the development cannot take place at the same time.Also, when money is spent on insurance, less money will be spent on the development. 2.  If I play the game more than once, I shall do something differently in the second time. In order to achieve optimum progress and wealth on hand, I shall research every comet and neglect those comets with less likely impact possibilities. I shall only raise the insurance coverage had I been sure the coming comet will cause a disaster. Also, I shall raise the slider to raise the energy level to mitigate the impact of the hitting comet. However, I shall upgrade the pods whenever possible.The main things are the balance of the risk and protection. In order to obtain the optimum result, one must balance the resources on hand and sometimes moderate risks have to be taken. Also, I learnt from the game that time management is important. This is because each game has only 3 minutes and time must be utilized wisely to build up the community and to mitigate any impending and afterwards loss. 3.  This game requires a delicate balance between the various available options in order to build a healthy community. However, if I were to change the game, I shall do replace the â€œcometâ€ù with â€œtyphoonâ€ù. Typhoons come every summer to my part of the world and if the impact is direct, much disaster will result on the land area. The research on the â€œtyphoonâ€ù will be similar to that of the â€œcometâ€ù.There is one more thing I would add is the option to construct/enhance city drainage in order to mitigate the flooding brought by the typhoons."108.45.35.68,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Reflections about thegame RiskHorizon0. Technical issues: There are relevant differences betweenworking the game with flasher player compared to Unity web player. This one wasaccessible to me thanks to a link provided in the forum. The behavior betweendiverse browsers has a conspicuous impact in the gamerâ€™s performance and controlinstruments. 1. I think this a good game to understand the interactionbetween research, protection and insurance. The most relevant to me, in orderto reach the minimal 4th level is protection and the ability to keep an adequategreen speed in the gauge sensor of development. Â The amount of capital and timing were criticalcombined with a level of protection above 80%. Insurance in this game or atleast for the level 4th wasnâ€™t very relevant.2. I played several times. My final and relatively successfulstrategy was to increase as much protection, without jeopardizing the time to guaranteean adequate level of welfare to Alora. Â 3. I would improve the knowledge (research), perhaps torefine the buildings damaged based on the comet trajectory. The more research Icould focus the protection in one subzone. Â The insurance aspect apparently is notperceptible as relevant. I can purchase some insurance plan but when the impacthappens there is no visual reference to figures to compare the advantages ofthe plan. I would add more time to prepare some strategy as parameters andduring the game learn, to adjust those parameters. Â An addition to this game, perhaps beyond the scope thispoint strictly related to knowledge, protection and insurance, is to introducesome elements of sustainability. What are the actions or behaviors that aremore sustainable?Â  I read that in the gamethere is a â€œmini game â€œ, where some yellow dots? (I couldnâ€™t see them) can be dragand connected, Â to express the linkagebetween the community. This is perhaps a way to approach sustainability, but Iwas not able to play with in this game. Â Â In order to represent risk management that matter in the placewhere I live, I would propose to use an example with one threat: flooding. Myhouse is especially vulnerable to flooding. In some cases has been inundatedand damaged the basement with a critical economic impact. Applying the three elementsexposed in this course:1. Knowledge. Itâ€™s very important to predict when is goingto rain heavily to keep ready all the provision. Those include an electricgenerator because in many cases, when it rains associated with strong winds,trees fall and disconnect the electric power. . A special training to people relatedto our house and eventually neighbors, has been very useful to handleadequately the power supply. Â The sumppumps require electricity if there is no power, no drainage possible. Â 2. Protection. I need to build some drainage system to guaranteethat water is no accumulated. Also clean leaves and other debris to avoid drainageobstruction3. Insurance. Keep the insurance the clause of flooding is a reliefto pay the cost reparation for flooding. Another element to include beside the three mentioned inthis course is to include the contingency plan. This is very important becausein many cases to have eclectic scenarios improve the outcomes. In my case ofthreat for flooding, I included as plan B to have a battery power pump in casethe main generator does not work poperly.Â A final reflection about the risk elements is the need toquantify them, in order to be able tocompare and predict outcomes based on models. The value of the investment inresearch normally is neglected."14.139.227.82,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Â According to me the main crux of the game is to maintainbalance between development and risk. The more we develop the more damage costwe need to bear. But the game has provided us with certain tools to deal withthis risk. There are three main tools to deal with the risk they are Research,Protection and Insurance. The research tool helps us acquire the knowledgeabout the comet and if the comet hits the planet weâ€™ll have more time toestablish connections with our neighbors and reduce the damage. But every timewe do the research weâ€™ll lose some money which will be our sunk cost as thisamount could be used in the development of the community. So how much researchto be done is the critical decision over here. We could choose the amount ofresearch to be done depending on the severity of the destruction indicated inthe severity meter and accordingly take the risk. Using research is similar toacquiring knowledge so knowing more about the event will help us in dealingwith the risk better but it has a cost associated with it and the better risk managementis to establish an optimal balance in between them. The second tool is Protectionwhich is indicated on a meter to the right. If the severity of the cometmatches the meter reading then we could avoid the damage. But the problem hereis that each comet has a different level of severity and we couldnâ€™t decreasethe level of protection after increasing it. And to increase the level ofprotection we need to spend more money and by increasing the level ofprotection more than required we are hindering the development. Â So here we need to choose that level ofprotection which can protect us from damages caused by maximum number ofcomets. The third level of protection is Insurance which can be selected fromone of the three options available. The insurance will bear the cost of damagebut choosing the required amount of insurance is critical because by overprotecting we can hinder development and by under insuring we need to bear coston damaged caused. We need to have a balance among these three tools to protectthe community adequately so that development can go on. By doing research basedon severity can buy us extra time to take help from neighbors and as we knowthe likelihood of that comet hitting us we could wary our strategy ofpreventing from damage could be varied from one threat to another unlike othertwo options where the level of protection or insurance ones set cannot bechanged from comet to comet. But by setting an adequate amount of insurance anda particular level of protection depending on our prediction of damage can beas useful as acquiring knowledge. I have played this game only ones and I over protectedmyself by choosing maximum amount of insurance and by doing so I lost lot oftime and also I was not able to develop as there was not enough money available.This strategy seemed good in first level as there was enough money andinsurance was also costing low. In my next attempt I will focus on research (whichI ignored in first attempt) by choosing optimal level of protection andinsurance.If Iam allowed to add features then we could spend a huge amount in developing atechnology over different levels to shoot the comets as there should be permanentsolution to this problem.Â "116.12.180.98,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game was 'innovation and creativity at its best'. The unique concept on which the game is based taking into account risk management is intellectually stimulating and allows a person to accept ideas and make fast conclusions. The game was an epitome of risk management principles and needed the player to make rapid decisions to avoid risk. The importance of time management to assess risks was also given a lot of importance in the entire process. The very fact that the player had to protect his buildings by increasing their altitude, getting insurance, improving its level and consecutively research on the comets as a measure to determine the risk they pose and clarify details shows the emphasis placed upon time management.There was a lot to tradeoff based on their importance at that particular instance. Sometimes the research done on the comet was too less or otherwise there was not enough development. A right balance had to be maintained. Realising the need at the moment and reacting based on that was very crucial. It does work the same way in reality as situation needs to be understood and right decision has to be taken.If I played the game again, I would be aware of all the various factors in the beginning and would waste much time getting the hang of it. Hnce my decisions will be taken faster and will turn out to be better. The major problem I was facing initially was to recognize the right time to take a particular action. That is what I will try to rectify if I play the game once more. It will definitely make a huge impact as strategic timing of actions is a basic need of risk management.A paid game would definitely do the trick of making it real time and bringing in actual risk factor where if a person loses, he loses the money he has invested and upon winning, a person earns extra money (which is actually a part of the money lost by those who could not win the game). This real time risk factor would trigger that sense of seriousness and panic which happens in any risky situation. That is what I missed in this version of the game because I knew that even if I lost the game, nothing would happen to me. To sum it up, the game was definitely very interesting and brought out core values in risk management to the fore."41.159.30.178,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The role of risk management was to understand how to protect an establishment while increasing the resilience for the future shocks. While managing the growth of Alora, I tried to establish the town to its full size in level 1 and while doing, researched the comets. Good side about researching is it doesnâ€™t stop your development unlike protection which enabled me to reach to the required level way before the time stopped.  However, starting from level 2, I had to both spend money on insurance (75%) and protection. No matter what, the town strongly depended on insurance more than protection to continue developing. Again, I reached the cap before the stopwatch. In levels 3 and 4, I followed the same pattern with 75% insurance and unlike some comets hitting it, none were able to damage the town.Insurance always saved my life and minimized amount of protection to the level where I hardly depended on it let me continue to the game with a decent flow of cash while researching the comets and enjoying the growth of the town. In level 5, I thought I was spending too much money on insurance as nothing had been able to damage the town before and I wanted to make a difference and bought an insurance plan of 50% and wanted to concentrate more on the growth of the town as I wanted to grow even faster than before. Well, that ended my growth as one comet hit the town hard and hindered my growth for good. It was too late to raise the protection to the right amount when it hit the town despite the amount of time spent on research it. So the end came.Although I didnâ€™t mention how I played the game in the first trial, I played the game 2 times and reached to level 5 at most. In the first trial, I worked more on the protection and minimized the amount of insurance and couldnâ€™t even reach level 3. On the second try, I did the vice versa and reached level 5. I understood that even though personal protection is important and should be done, private help from the state/government/communities in means of insurance is a must to deal with large shocks and help the community to look to the future for continual growth in the game.If I were to change one thing, I wouldnâ€™t decrease the importance of protection that much. Protection shouldnâ€™t change the level meter to red. Itâ€™s understandable that protection decreases the growth rate but so does insurance by spending money on something rather the growth. By spending on protection, by raising the hill, you, in a way, are opening up canals that would bring water which are need for the growth of crops as well as your town. The game, from my point of view, was underlining the importance of insurance more than the required amount. It is clear that insurance is important but I, kind of, came to realize that this game was all about the huge importance of insurance while paying little to nothing to personal protection. By balancing this scale between protection and insurance better, it would be more realistic for the game to capture the importance of insurance."128.71.43.89,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The game illustrated mainprincipals of risk-management, usage of different kind of tools and methods,various choices and compromises which have to be made. The first point I wouldlike to outline is that coping with consequences of adverse events is mucheasier when certain precautions are made. It may sound quite obvious, however,it is necessary to understand that even in case of inevitable risks some measurescan be very helpful. So, what were the tools shown in the game?The most effective measure (as I discovered it during number of games) was toensure long-term protection from meteorites by building higher level of the""city's"" basement. The drawback of it, however, is a necessity ofwide range of factors, which include (1) time, (2) information, (3) resourses.Firstly, ""time"" means that while preventing damage from risky events(which, after all, even may not occur) people can not develop their""city"". The time factor is the more important the closer this eventis. As well as the closer the end of the level is approaching. Secondly, toprovide appropriate protection we need information about severity of theupcoming event, its possibility, etc. Otherwise, both time and resourses wouldbe wasted without any usefulness. The more information about the event isprovided the easier it would be to cope with consequences and the moreeffective undertaken measures would be. Finally, resourse is a significantfactor. This may include money (in the game), as well as natural, physical orhuman resourses. As in case of time, spending resourses on preventing damagemeans that other projects (building and developing houses) should be postponedor decreased.Another way to make it easier tocope with problems is to pay insurance before the risks are undertaken.However, sometimes it make people more irresponsible, because the insurancecompany would pay part (or most) of the reconstruction, which means that thecommunity will pay. This game doesn't not show this drawback. We might considerthat it does effect on our choice of effective risk-management. Thus, it would be better to implement some conditions for those who use insurance: for instance, they should reach some level of protection or spend at least 3-5 stages of exploration the meteorites.Â Thegame provide three options of insurance, that is why during the game we should also take into account isusefulness together with other tools. For example, at lower levels, when meteoritesare not very severe it would be better to prevent damage at all by buildinglong-term protection. Thus, we are both capable of providing such protection(of 3 or 4 levels) and save money with buying low-cost insurance. At higherlevel, basement construction is much more expensive, so insurance would beworth it and reduce costs (by the way, at higher level development of the""city"" leads to more expenditures on reconstruction).Risk-management is compromisingbetween different ways to prevent, mitigate and cope with events, consideringexisting conditions, aims and available resourses.Â "73.46.63.34,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"1. The role of this Risk Management Game was to simulate a real life situation involving risk management. As we was taught in the lectures, By increasing protection and buying insurance we protect are selves from risk but lower are growth.In impoverished areas the costs of protection may seem far more devastating than a crisis. An example is the rising cost of insurance, while it proved effective when the meteors hit it was very tempting to lessen insurance if the research had shown less than a 20% chance of the meteor hitting, balancing out risk with growth.2.Some of the things I would differently if i replayed the game would be to Maximize more growth as my undoing was being to cautious, in a world of risk, sometimes it may be wiser to take growth over low damage or low chance crisis.Some of the things i learned for the game is the real life concept of the risk, and growth as well as my personal preference to more security than growth.One change I would make while playing this game is a human addition, the concept of human population or moral, while this game helps to highlight the basis of risk/development it doesn't do Justice to real leadership descions that don't just involve buildings but the peoples satisfaction and livelihood during such events.Living in an area that is prone to hurricanes i believe that the concept of prediction and research well defines my area."14.139.86.166,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was very importantas one has to decide whether to build Â with the given resources or has to takeinsurance and in the same way recover from hit when the comet hits.

I chose to firstbuild whole community and then take people support. Main motto of this game wasto build a community protect it from hit and manage risk in a efficient way in the given time, with available resources.Initially while playing for first time I was building and thenprotecting the houses from hit and then was coping for hit by repairing them. Secondtime I started to take insurance as soon as I build the house, 50% insurance inorder to protect from hit. In the next game I started taking people supportusing that I reached 6th level, rather than taking insurance, takingpeople support to avoid risk was a better option.I would propose 100% insurance and a alarm to indicate whenever a meteor hits the place, so that people will be cautious about the riskinvolved if that hits the planet. I would keep some lifelines and increase thelevels to 8, thus increasing the risk levels in each level to check that well equippedrisk management techniques are used in order to protect from major threats."193.173.21.236,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,30.0 to 33.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,3.0 to 11.0,"1. Acquiring relevant knowledge about probable damages, insuring these possible damages and securing sufficient protection were the essential instrumental tools to ensure consistent development of the village. Tradeoffs consisted mainly of allocating money between investing in upgrading, full insurance or higher protection. Striking good balance between these three were the key to development. Preparation was my most relied on tool, because it allowed me to concentrate more in the upgrades while being safe on the risk side. While preparation was short term cost with benefits occurring later in the game it saved a lot of money and time from post -damage reparations and constructions. 2.Â  Yes I played the game several times till I could no longer advance beyond the 5th level. After the initial failures I understood the importance of better protection and hence paid more attention on setting up good protection from the outset of the game. I learned that while building (upgrading) I had to intensively survey the passing comets for risk profiles. Acquisition of the knowledge enabled me to adjust the level of my protection in timely manner hence avoid devastating calamities. Essential it was not to rely just on full insurance coverage. Instead of curing the post accident damages which cost both money and time, prevention via adequate protection saved substantial financial resources and also eased the time constraint.3.Â  I would add more uncertainty factor into incoming benefits from the plants. In the game it was 100 percent predictable and stable over time, whereas in real life scenarios it is hardly ever possible to fully predict income from the projects. Adding uncertainty into financial profits from the production of the plants would introduce another dimension of risk and hence require risk management in that dimension as well. That meaning financial risk management. All in all, however the game was quite challenging and assembled the main components of risk management that we encountered in the lectures and also the readings. It was nice to see the application of these principles into a funny yet difficult game like this.

Several features stand out. Risk management isthe balancing of time and resources to mitigate the damage caused by opportunisticbehavior that is inherently dangerous. Itâ€™s necessary to prioritize bydetermining what kinds of dangers are present. By assessing the range ofuncertainties and monitoring the danger, the risk manager can allocateresources correctly. This increases the probability that a positive outcomewill result and allow a society to increase its economic output. There is always a risk in how one allocates availableresources. Deciding how and when resources are used becomes the deciding factorin advancing in the game. The resources are time and money. It may seem to be asimplification, but in life as well as the game, everything can be distilledinto these constraints. The game required that the player balance the amount ofmoney spent on economic development versus money spent to build flood protectionand money available for insurance. Time is divided between researchingdisasters versus time spent building defenses. By achieving an optimum balance,economic prosperity can be achieved as signified by advancing in the differentlevels of the game. Money limits development, so if too much money is spent on defensivemeasures, then that slows down development. If too much money is spent oninsurance, that also slows down development. Because development depends on reachingcertain dollar amounts before further development is possible, then spendingcan affect development immediately. The best strategy in the game is usually to try to increasedevelopment as much as possible and to increase development speed. One can'tlose focus on development. More development provides a greater economic cushionin case of disaster. It also provides greater resources to provide for more defenses.Â A simple change to the game would be to use earthquakes as a disaster to reflectthe problems in California. With such a change, research might try to moreaccurately predict earthquakes â€“ although so far there has been little success.Research in defensive features such as more stringent building codes as wellinfrastructure that can survive a massive earthquake would be a more realisticgame play. Multiple disasters such as earthquakes, wildfires, drought, and floods wouldmore realistically model Californian risks. In other countries, hurricanes,tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanoes, and winter storms might be used. Fortunatelyfor our world, the dangers of asteroid collisions are probably rare.Although natural disasters are an important and cost effective type of risk that can be mitigated especially for the least developed societies, It is only one category of the myriad disasters that can befall a country. A large earthquake can destroy nations in a matter of hours. The Indonesian tsunami, the Haiti earthquake, the Sichuan earthquake are sudden and mind numbingly destructive, but the devastation from disease, famine, drought, war, can be more devastating. Because the effects can stretch over years, decades, generations, they frequently escape widespread publicity except when a TV show or newspaper decides to do a ""thought"" piece that highlights the problems. These problems are frequently intractable, not the least because they frequently have financial, political or ideological motivations as a root cause and so cannot be resolved by the installation of warning sirens. The economic damage can be even more far reaching than a sudden destructive force. Diseases such as malaria, AIDS, and ebola have devastated continents. The people are left weakened and unable to work. Life expectancy is drastically cut. Risk is widespread. Damage is universal and the need for solutions absolutely urgent."209.189.131.15,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Question 1.Role of risk management in the game:The role ofrisk management in the game was to sustain and grow the community of pods inthe face relentlessly threat of devastation by way of comets crashes. What choices did you make and whattrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?Theprimary choices made were between research (knowledge) and insurance. Perhapsbecause I did not any higher than level three, protection did not play a majorfactor. Growing the community of pods faster certainly meant that there wasincrease in the density of targets thus the need for more insurance.In what ways did preparation forrisk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Thepreparation for risk, i.e. research, provided more knowledge in the form ofmonetized resources. This â€œknowledgeâ€ù enabled me to sustain and grow thecommunity aftershocks occurred (comet crashes). More research also gave me someindication of how much protection (insurance) to purchase. Also, the issue ofupgrading the pods versus purchasing more insurance was tradeoff that wasinteresting because why should upgrades be such an important issue..Question2.If you played the game more thanonce, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the mainthings you learned from the game?I played thegame several times. I experimented with varying scenarios. One scenario that Iplayed involved avoiding purchasing insurance as opposed to another scenariothat involved purchasing lots of insurance. The more insurance bought based onresearch, the more successful I was in getting to higher levels. This was trueup to a certain point as insurance became more and more expensive at the costof upgrading the pod community. I had difficulty understanding why I shouldcontinue to build and upgrade the community which was under constant threat oftotal destruction.Question 3.What change would you propose tobetter represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I would propose that the option to migrate outthe current scenario to another â€œplaceâ€ù and thus assume the risk consequencesassociated with that migration. It doesnâ€™t make much sense to remain insituation where one is under constant threat of total destruction and unable toimprove the condition."188.93.135.34,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk-management in this game is very high. Virtual model ofthe process in this game has high risks and opportunities. It is very importantto analyze situation at all, to collect information about all important risksand develop preventive actions. Then it is very important to analyze how these actionscould influence on podâ€™s community and result of project. Â There are several risks here â€“ shocks by comets and low growth of pods.Â Risks: Â Everycomet has short characteristics â€“ severity, hitting. Â The total recourses are limited. Every minutewe need to make a decision â€“ how and when to spend money more effectively. Â Preventive actions:Â I used knowledge, protection and insurance but my strategies changed.So it isvery important to reach balance between preparing for risk and investing in podsâ€™developing. Â First attemptAt my first attempt I spent all my money on building and upgrading pods,so I hadnâ€™t free resources for protecting my pods. All my pods had been damaged,game was over â€“ my recourses were limited. Â Â After first attempt I understood that I need invest in protection. Second attempt So in my next attempt I tried to spend money on preparation for cometâ€™shit. Â I bought full insurance, raisedprotection at maximum bars, but this attempt was unsuccessful too â€“ I hadnâ€™t resourcesfor growth generated from the pods to proceed to the next level. Third attemptAt my third attempt I tried to find balance between risk preparation anddeveloping my pods. I built many pods at first level, collected knowledge for comets. Ifthere is a low severity (two bars) I used protection slider for protection.Â Incase of comets with high-level severity I bought insurance. Â Â Â So I think that the best strategiesfor this game are following: 1. Â Try to upgrade the pods asfast as it is possible; 2. Spend time for comet research, especially for the high severe strikes;3. Â Protection is also a key toavoid the damage. I raised the level of protection and hold it until it matcheswith the level of the severity of the comet. Â I like this game, thank you very much for it. I wantto add only one thing â€“ history of my actions and some information â€“ how myactions (may be group of actions) influence to result of game.

Development needs resources, resources need technology and technology needs research. A community struggling for its setup can not think of investing in research areas because of its high costs and complexity. Investment in Research arena is a huge challenge and is full of risk. After crossing through this start up phase, resources can be pooled accordingly and then be invested in the research area. In the context of the game,a balance was needed between the growth in the development percentage and the level of the ground barrier( symbolizing technology) to be raised. Moreover, Research was also important because it helped the community to tackle and cope up with the losses. The more time the community spent on this area, the better information it had accumulated. Plus, preparedness through research also enabled the community to spare some time towards better communication and faster rehabilitation. An area to be focused by any developing community is the importance of having a good communication network. An Adhoc Network must be set up in every disaster prone area to have an emergency contact with the habitats. Sometimes this emergency network can prove to be life saving medium of communication post a disaster. Survivors can help each other during these crises time so that losses can be minimized. During a disaster, their is a huge loss of life and property. Life losses can not be prevented, but after shocks due to loss of property can be minimized. One of the effective way is to undertake a better insurance policy which will help to cope up with the losses in minimum costs and investment. Insurance provides a back bone and courage to actually adopt risk for a better opportunity. An insured person can undertake more work and can utilize resources in a better manner. One hard truth that nature displays is that the time and resources that have to be utilized for the development scheme,some of them have to be used for preparedness against any disaster. That results in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, rather slowed down, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I had reserved some resources for research and preparedness. Most importantly, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. Sometimes, after shocks of a disaster leave a long lasting effect on the life of the effected people.The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community.Â "210.11.132.118,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,-2.0 to 17.0,-36.0 to 1.0,-15.0 to 1.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,11.0 to 46.0,"1. Risk management was used in the game to mitigate the effect of a meteor crashing and damaging the pods in the game. This was achieved through knowledge (researching the meteors impact, and building up time to decrease its damage), protection and insurance. In the game all aspects require time of which only 3 minutes per level is available. A trade-off needs to be made made in terms of resources and time as to what apsect needs to be addressed first. Initially it is necessary to develop, in order to increase income, while at the same time deciding whether to insure or protect the pods from damage from the meteors. The damage from the meteors can also be reduced by researching them. If development occurs to quickly their is not enough protection for the pods due to lack of resources. However, if to much protection is provided, there is not enough time to gain knowledge about the meteors. Further, if the damage from meteors is only insured, the time taken to repair the pods greatly decrease the time available for development. By preparing for the risk, time was not required to repair the pods, more resources were available to develop the pods, and in the case of protection very little damage occurs to the pods.2. The first time I played the game I did not use protection adequately, and spent the majority of my time on research. This resulted in much of my time being spent on repairing the pods. The game taught me that their needs to be a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance in order to allow for development, and future growth.3. In the game it is possible to avoid any damage by providing high levels of protection, combined with research. The importance of insurance is understated, as in the majority of cases protection results in zero damage. In real situations this is not the case, insurance is required to cover options tht cannot be protected. A possible addition to the game would be to have protection, but only for certain pods, while other pods are still vulnerable to damage. This would more accurately represent real world situations where certain areas are more susceptable to damage from natural disasters than others."208.122.254.142,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Inmy opinion the role of risk management in the game was to developthe Alora community to the best of oneâ€™s ability while confronting falling comets (shocks) in thedevelopment endeavor. The choices I made were I started the development of thepods, then when the comets started coming I would increase protection to matchthe severity of the shock. As I went further, with more developments andupgrades, I got Insurance to mitigate the effects of the shocks produced by thefalling comets on the pods I had developed, in case there was a hit. In thefirst level, raising the height of the area I had developed decreased the chancesof the comets hitting and destroying the pods but as I went on to the second,third and forth levels, it was difficult to balance preparation with the shocksand I had a couple of hits. I also did not understand how to create communityconnections before the comets hit, as was stated in the rules of the game.The first time I played, I investedmore time and resources on protection which cost me more. Subsequently, I triedto research more, checking the severity and chances of hits, however, it was difficultto interpret the results and act on them, I also got more insurance, that is,the more developed the pods became I bought more insurance than the previous sothat incase I had damages, they would not cost too much resources to repair.Along the line, I realized that, the notches on the research bar increased perthe number of times I clicked on the comets before they fell, and when they didhit, I had the challenge of averting the severity of damage on the pods. I alsolearnt that, the more upgrades I made on the pods, it increased my resources topermit me make various choices like buying insurance, getting more protectionand doing much more development.Having a chance to contribute to thegame I would work on the research aspect of the game and even place a buttonfor research on the game board. I would make research more explicit so that,anyone playing would not only have knowledge of the shocks but be able tofilter it and make well informed decisions and choices, when balancing preparation(knowledge, protection and insurance) and coping from the effects of shocks."167.220.224.39,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Proper risk managementÂ simply means that you should strike a balance between the effort being put in the development and the resilience to unexpected events which may negatively affect the development. The resilience itself should be built based on knowledge to know how much protection is sufficient and how much insurance is required. By having the knowledge, you can judge the impact in case something bad happens and the chance of the occurrence, such that you can plan ahead to mitigate the risk. On top of that, community engagement also plays a vital role in the execution.The main things I learnt from the game are:Â  If you focus too much on development and disregarding the risk, you will pay for it when something bad happens (the development can be severely ruined without proper protection  insurance). However, if you focus too much on protection  insurance, you will miss the opportunity for growth (the speedy advancement of development).In summary, you have to gather the necessary knowledge on what's good for the development and the risks, plan ahead how fast you have to advance and strike a balance on building resilience(don't wait until something bad happens to you), flawless execution Â community engagementÂ are also key to success (because without the help and teamwork from the community, your plan may falter. Therefore, effective communication and support from the community are also required)If I were given a chance to improve the current version of the game, I would give additional details/data of how much return being generated by having additional pod vs upgrading the existing pod (and also how it affects the development bar). This is because without the data, it will be very difficult for the players to make informed decision on what's best for development, whether he/she should add more pod or to upgrade to achieve optimal development. This also greatly affects the final result because if the player can have greater rate ofÂ development at the beginning of the game, it will really help at the latter part since the player will have more resources to have a better protection and to advance in the development.Another thing which can be improved from this game is the knowledge gained by doing research on the meteors. The knowledge should stay and be accumulated with every meteors being observed. In the current game, it seems that the knowledge is just specific to each different meteors."93.183.195.210,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk Horizon is a simple but a very interesting game that helps us to obtain some practical knowledge about importance of risk management to succeed. The main role of risk management in the game is to identify, evaluate and reduce risks of damaging the growing city by objects from the space. And if the damage was happened, repair it cheaply (with proper insurance police). In the game I made many choices based on knowledge about space objects (probability of hit, power of posible damage), level of protection (upgrade or not the landscape) and the price for insurance (what policy to buy) to get the best result. Olso, need to mention, preparation for risk affected development immediately in this high paced environment.Each time when I played the game again I tried different strategies in risk management to achieve the better result in development. I paid mone attention to knowledge about space objects and tried to calculate quickly what type of insurance I need to buy (if anyone).There were many thing I learned from the game:- you need to be highly adaptable for changing environment to make right dicisions;- all risks must be properly evaluated;- gathering a required amount of information is very helpful for risk analysis and continious development;- information about past events can be very useful as well as for insurance decisions and for the risk minimization;- the more we prepared more benefits we will obtain from risk management;- insurance can be very helpful when it used with reasons and clear reasons;- anyone can achieve good results with proper risk management;- the fourth planet is the deadliest )There are many uncertainties in the place where I from.

Since I consider myself arisk-averse individual I immediately opted for the maximum level of insurancein order to have enough liquidity to rebuild everything in case of impact with theasteroid. Then I split a part of my money equally between knowledge andprotection. I donâ€™t know if that was a good choice because at the beginning ofthe game, having spent a significant part of my money in insurance, I had tostart the development of the pods very slowly. Going forward, however, I stillmanaged to pass the first level. Then I increased the development of pods. Ingeneral I initially spent heavily to prepare well the possible impact of theasteroid more than to the massive growth of pods. I played thegame two times. On Monday I played the game only once and I failed the secondlevel due to too much damage as a result of an impact a few seconds from theend of the timer. Today I played again focusing more on protection than thefirst time and proceeding to the development of pods gradually. In this way Iactually got a better result. If I had played it a third time I think I wouldlean more on knowledge and protection of choosing a cheaper insurance. In thisway I would have avoided spending a lot of money at one time being able tobetter distribute the remaining dollars over the long term.It is clear thatthe three components of risk prevention proposed by the game are absolutely themost important to be able to cope with a sudden and disastrous event; howeverthere are other components that were not considered such as the cooperation. Ilive in the European Union and for us it is very important the cooperation ofthe Member States in taking important decisions of different nature to help eachother. Thatâ€™s way to improve the game I propose to introduce the possibility ofinteracting with closer planets so that you can take international agreementsthat may contribute to the collective growth and lower costs for the reductionof risk. For example this could be achieved with the passage of informationgathered about the asteroids from one planet to another if the celestial bodycould hit more planets."68.37.2.195,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"After several attempts at the â€œgameâ€ù, I began to wonder whyI was sitting there wasting valuable time which such and pointless activity.While, it is not my expressed attempt to be negative or critical, I believe it tobe inevitable that it will be perceived in that light. Since negative comments,even though accurate and true or based on personal opinion, usually elicitnegative responses, I am prepared for that to be reflected in my peer assessmentscore.Â While it might have been the MOOC professors sincere intentto demonstrate the principles of risk management, discussed so far in thiscourse, using this game, I think it failed to do so. While it could be arguedthat this game was intended to provide a simple example of risk managementtechniques, I found it quite a pointless exercise. Â So far in this course, we have discussed many examples andelements of the negative effects and consequences of poor or nonexistent riskmanagement, whether as a result of lack of information, failure to act andprepare or because of the lack of available capital. When this situationexists, the people easily become the victims of unexpected shocks withdevastating consequences almost always resulting in loss of lives and capitalassets.Â  Conversely, we also studied ofcommunities/states that have learned from past failures and have put into placeeffective safeguards and shock â€œbuffersâ€ù using effective risk management tools.They often accomplish this by gathering and studying accurate data and alsopooling resources for the common good. While this often does not completely eliminatethe shock effects (short and long term), it goes a long way in lessening thenegative effects (such as the shelters in Bangladesh). Other communities havelearned to use risk management tools to provide future opportunities (Ethiopia â€“Productive Safety Net Program).Â Part of the failure of the game, in my opinion, is that itfailed to provide any opportunities for improvement and development. Rebuildinghouses after being hit by the comets were not growth opportunities, they weresimply methods to return to previous pre-shock levels. Further, I think thegame was overly simplified and polarized in its focus on capital expendituresand the purchase of a single insurance product. It does not provide for anyother insuring mechanisms. It was also singularly focused on the loss of property, andnot the more important elements of loss of human lives and resources. Theseelements are often non-renewable and irreplaceable. Should we have drawn frominference that the destruction of those buildings also correlated with the lossof human lives? There was no evidence of this, therefore could not be a logicalconclusion. This game is certainly not a good example or exercise in thepractices of effective risk management, since effective risk management usuallyworks to minimizing spending and available resources while also minimizing thenegative effects (short and long term) and reducing the future effects of the reoccurrence of a similar shock.Â To improve this game I would make it more inclusive of othermore realistic elements involved in shocks, and also increase the speed of thegame. I would have preferred a case study allowing us to design a recovery plan."190.41.168.40,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"Game Relection ExerciseThe role of risk management was to demonstrate thatfor every decision is made, it involves risks to assume. Risks are everywhereand whether or not desirable to avoid, they can become in interestingopportunities in order to improve aspects of our quotidian life. In the game, Imade choices of improve the protection of the planet against the meteorites soI spend some money in order to increase it. I faced some interesting trade -offs in terms of knowledge because I spent some time looking for information ofthe meteorites and, unfortunately, I could not increase the planetâ€™s protectionor upgrade buildings; insurance was other because of the money I spent. One waythat preparation affected development was when I picked up the insurance, I hadsome doubts about buying it because the majority of meteorites failed toimpact, so I was buying a probability of being secured in case of an impactthat possibly wouldâ€™ve never occurred, and with that money I invested ininsurance I could have upgraded buildings faster.I liked the game. For that reason I played the game more than once and when I tried it for the first time I getonly to level 1 because I focused on defense instead of upgrading buildings ordoing some research, so citizens disapproved my management. I finished level 5on my third time and for getting that level I decided to increase defense onlywhen I felt citizens were happy with my resourcesâ€™ management. The main thingsI learned for the game are that, unfortunately, citizens really donâ€™t care toomuch about safety and prevention and it really can cost you popularity andauthorities that are concerned by popularity will prefer not to invest inprevention and we can see some examples in Latin American, Asian and Africancountries that by not being prepared to prevent risk systematic. Another thingI learned was the importance of acquiring insurance in case of a collisionbecause it helps to get some resources in order to reconstruct infrastructure.Finally, IfI had the opportunity to participate in a new version of the game, I will try toadd social conflicts such as emigration and diseases because those issues arevery common in non-developed countries. Also I will insert topics such as sustainabledevelopment and the option to interact with organisms such as UN in order to completemissions and reach goals such as millennium goals."86.38.22.41,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.

My initial approach was totry to evenly balance between knowledge, protection and insurance, howeverafter a several attempts it became apparent that this was not feasible.As a result of the first few attempts, itappeared that knowledge was best applied against the most catastrophic events,reflecting that enhanced knowledge of a likely occurrence and subsequent levelof preparedness allowed adequate time to react to and to cope with the shock,thereby reducing the impact to much more manageable levels, in some instanceseven down to zero impact.Focusing knowledge in this way, allowed meto quickly identify and categorise the various levels of risk to be faced inthe foreseeable future, which subsequently freed up resources to deal withâ€œroutineâ€ù shocks through the use of protection and insurance.The mechanics of the game clearlyhighlighted to me the importance of using knowledge, protection and insurance asa comprehensive toolkit in managing risk, and that to try to use one, or eventwo, without the other would result in failure.Having identified these issues, I changedmy approach to then ensure that I provided the highest level of insuranceallowed, together with the highest level of protection I could afford withoutcompromising my ability to meet the financial target, and then focussedknowledge collection on the most catastrophic level of events in theforeseeable horizon. This allowed me to progress to the higher levelsconsistently on several attempts as I refined the methodology. Unfortunatelytheir was a glitch in the simulation, and the game reported a null error onlevel six several times.The modified approach above allowed me toprogress development relatively evenly and consistently with minimal impactfrom the inevitable shocks.The simplicity of the game allowed it to deliver a powerful message and demonstrate the key principles of Risk Management, however given the opportunity to make one change in the game I would introduce a more defined risk vs reward mechanism. Currently the game allows a facility to be built which can then be subsequently upgraded. The cost of each upgrade becomes increasingly expensive. Given the financial target that has to be achieved you have no choice but to upgrade as there is limited space to build basic facilities. In my version of the game, I would provide a large enough playing field that the player could conceivably meet the financial target for at least the first few levels. A level 1 building would of course have restricted income, low resilience against shocks and limited insurance availability which would reflect a traditional income in some regards. If the player then chooses to upgrade, the player would be rewarded with better insurance, exponentially better income and higher resilience allowing faster (and cheaper) recovery after sustaining a loss. This would help demonstrate the individuals ability to contribute towards his/her own protection through managing risk at the personal level.Â "75.182.102.127,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"From this game, I think the role of risk management is tobalance the build of the planet, avoidance of hit, and to the insurance withlimit capital.Â  As the video talked in week2, we can use knowledge,insurance, and protection to lower the damage of the risk before it happens.This game reflects these factors so well. During the game, I gain knowledgeabout the severity, change of hit of the milestone; also I can buy insurance at some cost for different levels toprotect my community; last, the protection can also be applied by click theright corner to increase the horizon to avoid the hit.Personally, what I usually do in the four levels is to buildthe planet first, then use the time period to â€œresearchâ€ù to lower the case ofbeing hit, then quickly to increase the protect level by click the rightcorner.Â  I bought the insurance at thebeginning, the level will be accordingto the money I have currently, so that the damage will be limited.Â At first level, I always got hit, but because I hadinsurance, so I do not need to spend lots of money to repair that.

In my second try, I almost get no hit or no damaged, which means theprotection works. And to the end I tried to buy no insurance just forexperiment, and then I found as long as I had an enough horizon and research,the community would be no damage even got hit.The main things I learned from the game is that to protectsomething against risk, the better way is to build a system, which means, notonly depends on one method, but to build the warning system in many ways atsame time, so that the loss will be minimum, for example, to combine theinsurance and protection together, meanwhile build the predict and warningsystem. Also, we cannot ignore the low possibility risk, because it still mayhappen and cause bad result.If I have a chance to modify something, I may add a â€œliveâ€ùcharacter, like a human being, who can help to do the things, but the playerhave to spend time to set the action of the character advanced."88.172.110.96,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,30.0 to 33.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,11.0 to 46.0,"Role of risk management in the gamein this game the risk assessment management was essential in fact it was mainly the purposeof the game.

Â I discovered the only way to make money is to build and upgrade structures as fast as possible. Â In the beginning this was easy and cheap. Â Insurance wasn't a real worry. Â And my only mitigation was elevating my community. Â As my community became more expensive, i.e. upgraded, I found insurance to asl increase in price, but also the coverage increased. Â Meaning when my buildings started to cost over $500 to upgrade, the $135 insurance for 50% coverage for my community was worth it.

The role of risk management in the game was to develop the community, facing the hazardous Â asteroids that can ultimately compromise its well being and the ability to grow. In order to face the situation there were tools available that allowed for preparation. Research of the asteroids allowed for the creation of community connections before the comet hits this way Â acquiring knowledge, long term protection was achievable by raising the position of the island preventing greater damages. The last measure to prepare for the worst was insurence that could be bought to reduce the costs in the event of a rebuilding process.After an impact coping would be achieve through the rebuilding of the community depending on the damages, although its amount and the costs associated with the process would differ significantly depending on the preparation measures taken.All the preparation would impact the development of the community as it would consume resources in order to prevent greater setbacks. Some mechanisms like insurance would allocate a greater of money right away and the other two (insurance and raising the island level) would consume resources over time. In the end development would not be at its full potential of growth but it would withstand an hit minimizing the impact on the community. Great risk management capabilities can have great impacts in the communities helping distributing the available resources it ways where a perfect balance between prosperity and security is achieved.The first time I played I reached a pretty good balance between preparation, growth and coping with the hits reaching immediately the level 4.

In the third and last attempt and with the knowledge of the previous games I was able to find the perfect balance between preparation, development and coping reaching level five.

This does not always mean aiming for the highest potential as if the risks are too high then a lower level of survival may be preferable to a one in million success... In this case the risk management aspect was to grow the community whist also protecting it. The insurance aspect and raising the land height to preserve the growing community are comparable to real life situations... one could imagine that instead of comets we are raising the land against it is a neighbouring country we are raising an army against or a Tsunami we are raising a wall against, on the insurance side, it is to make comparisons with insuring a crop against bad weather...In this case growing the community has been simplified to building shelters but in real life managers will have to choose between investing in housing, schooling, infrastructures like roads, clean water and electricity...To 'win' this game I realised that there would have to be trade offs, there is a time factor in which you need to have grown the community to an 'acceptable' size but if you do not take care of the community it may well get destroyed and then you are worse off than you started...2.

In the first instance, the game is set up in such a way that it is prone to disasters which present a situation in which one has to apply the knowledge acquired during the first when playing the game. Building puds, buying insurance and also increasing the level of your community when playing the game are strategies which does not only prevent your community from disasters but in present a situation in which can simply recover from it if its occur. for instance, if you buy insurance when playing the game, in instances when you are hit you can easily use the insurance you bought to help you recover for from the hit. And as we where told during the start of the putting measures in place in order to recover form a disaster is a proactive way to manage risk.I was to play the game for the second time the first thing I will do is to increase the strength of my puds to help build more effective protective mechanism in place to not only protect my community but to reduce the causalities when it occurs. As it is specified in the note, one of the reason why risk management is important is as a result of the fact that it helps to protect people and properties from disasters and also hazards. This is because, with a proactive risk management strategy like information sharing, building standard structures as it was in the case of Bangladesh or Chili, properties and lives will be protected during and after disasters.Â  One of the changes I will add to the in order to provide a more effective risk management strategy is to create more space for puds to be built and also increase the the amount of insurance one can buy when playing the game. Increasing the strength of structures has a lot to do with time one can spend in playing the game. This is because of the fact that when hit by the rocks, the stronger the puds are the more your community can be protected from the impact of the hit. Also, ensuring that more space is created for a player to buy an insurance thatÂ  cost like $100 will also help in recovering after you are hit which will reduce the cost involve in the entire process.Â  "66.44.126.19,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk managementallowed one to make slow but steady economic progress.Â  By doing research I obtained informationabout the severity and the likelihood of potential threats.Â  That information allowed me to immediatelystart protecting the developments that were underway.Â  Additionally, by expending resources toobtain knowledge, start protective efforts and purchase insurance, I was ableto reduce the potential of harm and the extent of any harm that did occur.Â  However, effective risk management came at aprice.Â Â  Preparing for risk by engagingin protective efforts consumed my time and took me away from creatingadditional developments to increase economic activity.Â  Additionally consuming resources bypurchasing insurance decreased my ability to develop new properties.Â  In other words, preparing for risk affectedthe pace and extent of development.Â Preparing for risk management forces one to trade off risk managementefforts versus the amount of development.Â Â After playing the game the first time, Irealized that I needed to use my budget to start as many developments aspossible.Â  Engaging in several rounds ofthe game taught me that it is important to use ones resources to purchase asignificant amount of insurance as soon as possible as well as increase onesprotective efforts fairly early during each round.Â  This would enable one to focus afterwards onusing knowledge to anticipate shocks as well as spend a sizeable amount of timedeveloping properties.Â  The game alsoseemed very realistic.Â  One was forced toevaluate the likelihood and severity of a threat in order to decide whether onewas going to engage in protective efforts and/or buy insurance versus spendingresources on development.Â  As one went tohigher and higher levels of the game, it seems as though one needed to takemore and more risk by delaying protective efforts and building moredevelopments.Â  I believe this risk takingwas necessary to be more successful at the game.Â  Â The game did not seemto offer a convenient way to get communities to collaborate to protectdevelopment.Â  Maybe I did not understandhow to operate the risk management tools but I was unable to get communities tocollaborate to protect from risk or minimize the impacts from risk.Â  Living in the United States provides me witha tremendous amount of resources and well developed communities.Â Â  Communities here would benefit tremendouslyby increase the risk sharing within and between communities.Â  While it may be difficult to reflect thecomplexity and likelihood of successful collaboration between communities, it maybe more realistic to include that feature in the game or to make that featureeasier to use if it is indeed in the game."142.161.144.211,10.0 to 66.0,0.0 to 2.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in this game was to identify,assess, prepare, and cope with risk while undertaking health development in theworld of Alora.

As the Luminator of Alora, the player's task is to develop this extra-terrestrial community and reach milestones in development while managing wealth and the development opportunities with the risk that Alora faces from falling comets. The player must plan ahead to manage the risks of comet strikes while also reaching the development goals in the timed rounds in order to proceed to the next levels.Â Since each comet strike can cause damage to existing developments, requiring time and money to make repairs, the Luminator is incentivized to research comets in preparation for strikes, protect the community to reduce the damage caused by comets, and buy insurance to help mitigate the damages that occur. Not only must the Luminator decide how to allocate Alora's financial resources (since money spent on preparing for comet strikes necessarily reduces the amount that can be spent on further development), but the Luminator must decide how much time can be spent on preparation at the expense of additional development.The game is further complicated by the choices the Luminator must make in developing the community. Each pod costs money to build, but every added pod also increases the rate of development. In addition to building pods, the Luminator can also make upgrades to existing pods. I had to play several times to get to level 4 and discovered that upgrading existing pods helped Alora reach its development goals more quickly than building additional pods. The more developed the pods, the more money was generated per pod.As I played, I realized that sometimes investing in development was more rewarding than protecting against risk. Being too preoccupied with preventing damage led to rounds in which I avoided all damage from comets but could not progress to the next level because Alora did not meet development goals. The balance that I found most successful involved prioritizing opportunity over risk, but I did always buy the best insurance possible and kept researching comets so I could anticipate major hits. If my development progress was good, I knew I could afford to spend time and resources on protection, but I invested in pod-building and upgrading first.While Risk Horizon takes many factors into consideration, it is still a simplification of the challenges that communities face in risk management. While economic consequences can be a great detriment to developing a community, I would argue that the psychological impact of community is crucial to development. After all, what is the point of a community without the common bond of its members? I like the community connections game and the fact that development drops when preventable damage occurs, but I think more is required. My suggestion for improving the game would be to add development rewards for successful prevention and community connections."187.20.154.75,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"I found thegame a little confusing at the beginning.

We can say that the higher consumption of oil and its derivatives in emerging economies (such as China, India, Braziland others) and developed countries areresponsible for this.We can also observe that afterthe financial crisis of 2008-2009, many countries adopted expansionaryfiscal and monetary policies withthe objective of heating demandand avoid recession, among thesecountries include Brazil, the United States and others. The automobile sector in Brazil, along with several other sectors, has obtained anincentive to reduce taxes.Another point that we should note, was the explosive growth of the middle class in Brazil,which boosted demand for both gasoline, diesel and other petroleum derivatives that are present in our entire economy.Petrobras has greatly increased the level of investment in exploration and production, yet in President Lula. In2006 arrived at achieve self-sufficiency in oil from Brazil, but this victory was subsequently suppressed by the stronggrowth in oil demand, aconsequence of the growing middleclass in Brazil which was also favoredby government policies of the Lula government.With the discovery of pre-salt basinbetween 2006-2007, a great expectation arose from the federal government, by the size of oil reserves (about12 billion barrels of oil), and the complexity of oil extraction in high depth (about8,000 m below of the sea), a factwhich undoubtedly increases the cost andtime of production in theseregions, but did not appear asan impossible challenge, since Petrobrasis a world leader in deep water exploration.The company has been conducting ahigh level of investment toaccelerate oil production inthese regions, but there is aperiod of time for the investmentsto start give ""visible fruits"" in our economy.While oil demand is not fully supplied byPetrobras with the increasedproduction of the pre-saltbasin, the government, through Petrobras, imported part of petrol and diesel in the international market at a higher price, and transferredin the internal market to a lower price withthe objective ofÂ  contain inflation,making an impoundment of market prices, until the growthof production in pre-salt basin can supply allthe demand in the country.I believe that with the growth of production in pre-salt basin,and subsequently, self sufficiency in oil in the Brazil, the Brazilian economy will be less vulnerable to price fluctuation caused by the import ofgasoline and diesel.I also believe that the presence of the government in this sector will be crucial for the establishmentof a stable economy, with economic growth and the use of the profits ofoil royalties being used in sectors like education, health and others. But still, the newinvestments in renewable energy sourcesshould always continue in order to obtain energyalternatives that will reduce inthe long-term high demand for oilin the world.Â "202.134.172.75,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"A comet or a meteor is going to strike creating a directimpact on land through direct hit or the waves which in turn will cause acalamity.

The trade â€“ off which was controlled by us wasgetting an insurance. Building of pods was a time consuming process and theidea of the impact of the meteor could not be easily justified.The knowledge was through the research regarding the meteorstriking and its impact, the protection was undertaken to build the pod andupgrade to various levels, the insurance was acting as the cushion for therisk.The preparation for the risk in terms of building pods wasimportant and the impact after the calamity was over the recovery became theimmediate concern.

Whatchoices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms ofknowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for riskaffect development (immediately, or after some time)?The role of risk management in this game is (1) to determinehow much money to put into development versus how much to put into protectionand (2) to determine how much money to allocate between the various alternativesof protection, insurance and research.Â When faced with the threat, my first step was to provide the level ofprotection to match the treat. Then purchase the medium level of insurance.However, as the development expanded, purchasing insurance became extremelyexpensive, and I dropped to the minimum level. Having information on severityand probability of threat was extremely useful.Â  One of the learning was as the development grew the cost ofproviding and insurance became extremely expensive. Preparation for the risklimited the amount of money that could be put into development. But long termit is likely better to put some resources into preparation versus constantlyrebuilding after a disaster. Â Thissimulation was somewhat unrealistic since the cost was in money and did nottake into account the loss of lives and disruption of peopleâ€™s lives due todisasters.This game did a very good job of presenting the trade-offs between doing development and risk mitigation preparation.If you played the game more than once, what did you dodifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned fromthe game?I played the game several times.Â  After the first time, I changed my approach by continuing tospend on development but upgrading the preparation for a disaster â€“ meteorhit.Â  At first I would purchasedinsurance. But I then figure out that the information of probability of ameteor hit and the severity was extremely important in determine the amount ofpreparation needed.Â  When therewere multiple meteors, I would quickly determine the worst case and prepare forthat case.Â  The hints that weregiven after the game were extremely helpfully. This would be similar to acritique session that would be conducted after a disaster occurred.Â  The game was setup so that one couldrespond fast to an incoming meteor. This is unlikely the case in the real worldsince government and communities usually donâ€™t act fast. One of the main things that I learned from game was thevalue of having information about the impending disaster such as severity andprobability.Â  Information is criticalin preparing for any risk.Â  The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects ofrisk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of thegame, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would youpropose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in theplace you live?Â I would change the game to make the disaster mitigationopportunities through insurance and protection more realistic. The game allowedone to purchase insurance and increase the protection after it was found outthat a dangerous meteor was heading for the development.Â  This is unrealistic since no one willsell you insurance when you are about to get hit by a meteor.Â  And the prevention alternative such asraising the level of the development takes time to implement. I would install some type of limitation on when you can buy insurance. I also would install a time lag on how fast the protection can be implemented.Â  This would make the importance of having information on potential disasters extremely important."64.28.140.40,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,-36.0 to 1.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,11.0 to 46.0,"The Risk Management in the game was trying manage the risk of the meteor hitting the community vs developing the community.Â I the game the choices that had to be made was around developing and growing the town (which is needed) and knowledge/ researching (which took time), taking insurance and Raising the city (Protection) which took Time and Money. However as I came to find that each impacted each other so all the activities had to be done together to ensure that I could move pass the level. At some points I chose to develop more or raise the city to its maximum as I thought that was best for the city at the point in time given the risks around. Preparing for the risks up front at the start of the game allowed continued Development as the city was not affect or was not affected as badly. It cost little to no money to recover from a disaster which meant that one could continue developing further and not spend the time and money repairing.I played the game multiple times, and generally I got further in the game each time. This happened as I learnt how to ensure I do all that was necessary to manage the risk. On my first try I was only concerned with developing which did not get me far. Then I was only concerned with the meteors that would do the most damage. So when there was a meteor that had a high severity and low change of impact I took all the time raising the city and in the end it missed. By the time I had reach level 6 of the game the main things I had really learnt was that in order to be successful one must be able to focus on multiple things at a time. You had to be aware of the meteors in the sky what the severity was and the chance of success. In addition you had forecast that if it hits it will lower your protection so your protection must be high enough to cover the one that is right be hind it cause you don't have time raise the protection or do more research. The importance of having your hands in different pots becomes very important on reflection in risk management. Â Overall it was a great game and if I had to make any improvements so that it could better represent Â the risk management choices that matter in the place I live I would try to make more human. The greatest risks where I lived are cause by humans mainly crime. So hindrance to development come from a more social aspect and not such a supernatural out of this world element. I think the natural disaster risks are important to manage but even in these they some times come down to the human risks. Imagine you build shelters but the food is stolen or destroyed. The greatest risk comes from Humans and that should be address in the game to make it even better.Â "59.92.197.131,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Risk ManagementThe Risk Horizon game has helped me deal with risks better.

In the second attempt i also insured the buildings so that i don't end up paying an exorbitant amount of money to get the pods re-built and mend the damages. The risk of raising the platform was hampering my building speed and did not help in filling the bar to help me get through to the next level. I feel that i ended spending a lot of money on the insurance, if i had the chance to play the game again i would invest a little less in the insurance and take the odd risk in order to build more pods.

Your environment, financial status, extent of knowledge of your environment and vulnerability to shocks and risks, institutional systems and structures and technical know-how with regards to risk management all determine the ability to prepare for the shocks, cope with the risks and harness opportunities therein.Â Knowledge of risk management not only prepares you for coming shocks but also ensures ability to cope with subsequent risks and develop resilience while still carnying out your day to day tasks as an individual, household, community or government.The importance of Research and Knowledge:Â Research is an essential part of risk management and should be the first step. It is important to learn early enough, what the problems are, the possible magnitude, as well as the possible avenues to tackle them. Adequate research ensures that you select the most appropriate coping strategies, technology and mechanisms at the most effective costs for each specific shock or risk. It also leads to pay-offs in terms of opportunities and guarantees resilience to a large extent. Research without appropriate action however is futile, expensive and time consuming. It must be followed by implementation of activities be it protection, appropriate insurance cover, information, reinforcements and savings.Role of risk management in the game?Â It played a vital role in the game because without putting some knowledge of risk management to play, you would simply loose.Â The activities in the game enabledÂ me learn more about shocks,Â preparing ahead for the shocks based on the knowledge gained by protecting the community, insuring the against possible shocks, strengthening systems and structures through connections and enhancing the ability to cope effectively.Â Being able to do this generates much needed resources and savings that can be used to develop the community and further improve investments in development and build resilience to future shocks. It is more or less a delicate balancing act that requires assessment and reassessment of options and strategies as well as resources and taking appropriate actions while ensuring that development is not stagnated.Choices and trade-offsÂ in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance:Â As portrayed by the game, research/Knowledge without protection or insurance is fatal. However, development requires time, resources management and knowledge of the terrain as well as insurance and savings in case you get hit. If you overstretch yourself in securing protection which is sadly not cheap, then you will be left open to future shocks with limited ability to cope.Â Too little knowledge on the other hand means that you will be caught unaware and be unable to prepare and protect the community, household or individual effectively. Insurance is also not cheap but it gives one an added confidence to pursue other development endeavours so that in the event of inevitable shocks, recovery becomes easier, coping is more effective and resilience is gradually developed.Â Knowledge therefore is essential but must be backed by protection and Insurance.Immediate and Long term effect of preparing for risks on development:Â Preparation for risks is expensive in the short term. It can also slow down development because there are less resources available. After some time however, it begins to pay off and the gains can be seen in improved coping, stronger resilience and development.Conclusions:Â To better achieve success in subsequent attempts of the game, I made sure to continue to develop and match protection to severity of shocks based on knowledge gathered through research. I wouldn't change much about the game except maybe to reduce the cost of protection and insurance for poorer communities.

This is a very good example of how external factors (risks)can affect a community or group, be it countries, local groups or businesses. The game was a great experience which allowed me to observe how differentchoices affected the outcome of the game.By increasing the city protection, we were attempting to minimize or even nullifythe effects of the external source. The effects of protection were moreefficient as the protection levels increased to meet the potential of harm fromthe external source (comets). However, their cost became significantly higheras the level of defense required to match the comets increased. Since thecontinuous development of the community (the pods in the game) also becomesmore expensive as time progresses, diverting resources for the improvement ofdefenses above a certain level takes away resources that could be used for thedevelopment of the community. Also taking into account that the frequence in whichevents are stronger than that level of defence happens, an adequate insuranceplan would be sufficient to alleviate the problems caused by the externalsource and assist in a quick and cheaper reconstruction of the community. Thisalso meant that the insurance was bought at a time when resources where notcompromised before the harmful event took place.The use of knowledge is varied. Understanding the possible outcomes and probabilityof such an event helped planning the adequate amount of defenses required sothat resources are not wasted at the same time as defenses are strong enough. Thisincluded both the level of protection required and the amount of insurancerequired. Knowledge of the external factors also helps in facilitating theefforts for recovery after the incident has taken place.It must be noted, however, that the objective of the game is not to developyour community or to upgrade your defenses and insurance as fast as possible. Doingone of this actions would take away resources for the development of the other.In fact, the game emphasizes the need for a balanced development. This highlightsthe importance of management of resources both at good and at bad times as thedevelopment and the repair of the pods, the cost of raising protection and acquiringinsurance became higher as the game progressed.While the lessons from the game can be easily translated to real life, itwas a great opportunity to experience managing these components in a simplifiedenvironment. I actually liked the fact that it was not immediately related tothe place where I live, which allowed me to detach myself from it and thinkmore strongly about the concepts we are learning. For this reason, I would not adaptthe game to fit my own circumstances.Â "77.253.214.102,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"The RiskHorizon Game allows the player to experience risk management on a simple model.While building and developing pods you have to deal with the danger of collidingcomets, that can destroy your settlement.Â It is possible to prepare for this danger by insuring pods, raisingprotection or observing the comets. At the same time, these actions can be costlyor slow down your development. The mosteffective way of avoiding danger from the comets was rising protection, but italso meant spending money and halting the development of the pods. By spendingtoo much on it, you risked not completing the level in time. Insuring your podswas costly and didn't offer protection from damage â€“ it only lessened the costsof repairs. At the same time it didn't halt the building process. Observing thecomets was helpful when it came to dealing with the damage, but wasn't aseffective as the other 2 options. In other words, the most effective way ofpreparing for risk (rising protection), was the most damaging in the long runby negatively affecting development. Observing the comets didn't cost anything, but could only lessen the damage. Insurance didn't protect from damage, it helped with coping with it. These two options didn't affect development in the long run, but where not as good with protecting form the imminent destruction.Afterplaying I several times I learnt to first focus on the development and only afterthat on preparing for possible crises. If I spent too much time on protectingmy pods at the beginning, I wasn't able to complete the level on time. Thesecond part of my strategy was balancing the observation of comets with a rising level of protection. I usually focused on this in the last minute of everylevel, when I was sure I would reach the development goal. I spent my leftover resources on rising of protection, which better prepared me for the next level. In addition, careful observation of the comets allowed me to maintain a high level of protection throughout the game. In this way, even if I received damage, it was minimal. When I balanced these 3 elements properly (development, protection and knowledge), I didn't have to spend money on insurance.The onething I would add, to make the game resemble real-life risk management, wouldbe a way to benefit from taking risks. For example, some of the comets couldprovide additional income when they collided. Thanks to this improvement, everyrisk could be a danger or an opportunity. The player would have to decide, if he is in a situation where he can risk a collision of a comet that could prove beneficial."62.103.43.165,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,17.0 to 30.0,-15.0 to 1.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,3.0 to 11.0,"I found the riskhorizon game very enjoyable and useful. Addressing the questions, i emphasize the following:1. Risk management was the key to succeed. I reached level 6 following the above strategy: The first three levels, i focused on building and upgrading pods. The more i could the better. Research was the key point to succeed on avoiding damage, and of course to maintain the protection level according to the maximum meteor treat with severe chance to hit. From years 4 to 6, i focused on maintaining the protection level, to increase the research time, and i started buying a cheap insurance. On level 6, i bought the medium insurance plan, but never used it. I was never hit buy a meteor, thanks to research and protection level.2. If i played the game once, i would have bought from the beginning some insurance, losing valuable money from building/upgrading pods. I would also spent less time on research. Again i repeat that i think research and maintaining the correct protection level, were the key points. I conclude that almost everything we do has some cost, whether in time or resources. Appropriate risk management, which includes appropriate evaluation of the following danger, fast interaction with tthe world community, appropriate preparation are the key points to protect the community and develop. Definitely you must acquire some insurance, but you must evaluate appropriately, so not to expense excessively.3. If i was allowed to make one change, i would introduce the importance of institutions to the risk management, by adding a choise to construct and upgrade a ""Risk Management Institution"", which would reduce the damage made by meteors, but would be more expensive than building/upgrading pods."89.130.144.203,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,17.0 to 30.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,-5.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 11.0,"The gameshows how a decision maker in risk management has to perform in a very simpleway. Â You can learn how your decisions affectsthe development. Sometimes you take decisions that are better than others atthe time you make them but in the long run they perform poor than others. Inexplanation, you can spend money in the insurance and protection in a veryearly stage, the risk will have a very low impact or none, but your developmentwill grow less and in the long run you are not going to have develop enough. Makingdecisions always comes with a trade-off, you have to aim for the perfect.At the firsttime I played the game, I was playing very conservative. I was taking the 75%insurance as soon as possible.

But develop my buildings with minimal protection and a lowinsurance was not performing better.

Right now the community support is based on how quick you can clickat the right area in your screen. I think this is not a good representation. Communitysupport not relies on how quick communities can interconnect between them butalso how strong are the links, how big are this communities, how prepared arethem for the kind of risk, etc. Definitely, this is something I would change.In relationwith the changes to represent better the risk management choices that matter inthe place I live, I think that the current game already represents the differentaspects of risk management like knowledge, investment, protection andmitigation. Is true that I have little knowledge about how risk management isperformed in my area, but thanks to this course Iâ€™m starting to learn a lotabout it. Then, in the future I might change my mind about this."129.94.166.154,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management played a critical role in the game. Throughout the game there was the ever-present threat of meteors threatening your development pods. These were ranked differently and each showed different levels of risk to the pods. However, their potential impact on your development was devastating. As such, insurance played a key role in success. When I began playing the game, I initially was very hesitant to develop the pods. I overvalued the risk of the meteors based on the lack of data I had on them. I began playing without looking at the tutorials and simply dove straight in. I didn't know the meteors had different rankings, and I had no idea of the relative impact they could cause. I also had no idea there was so much of a push for development of the pods. As such, I played it in a relaxed, weary manner. I did not opt to develop out of fear, a fear that was in the end unfounded.On the second occasion, I played the game after going over the tutorials. This was a much smarter option and gave me a much better understanding of the relative risks of the different meteors, as well as the potential value in development. This encouraged me to develop fast. I built many pods and tried to develop on the ones I had. However this was also based on uninformed benefits of fewer developed pods as opposed to many undeveloped pods. I then purchased insurance covering 75 per cent of my losses. This proved vital as I was hit a number of times after I initially established my pods. I am not sure whether it was absolutely necessary to cover for 50% of the losses as opposed to 75% of the losses, but this is what I felt was best to do. It would be interesting to see whether this was an unnecessary cost or not.However, considering the number of meteors that hit, it seemed that the insurance was very effective. In the second level I only purchased 50% insurance as I was more rapidly expanding my development. This however cost me a lot as I was hit multiple times by meteors and the impacts seemed to increase with time in the game. This taught me the value of insurance. But it also taught me the vulnerabilities of developed pods which were extremely costly to repair. However, due to the number of investments, monetary flows were maintained and minimal repairs were made.If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to add interconnectivity between the pods. It seemed that the impacts on one pod did not affect the other pods, nor the cost of repairs or the revenue intake. As such, one could simply maintain a few pods while the others were still damaged and returns were no different. In my life, it seems that impacts are much more interconnected, and as the impacts of disaster increase, so too do the costs of repairs across the system as opposed to isolated damages and repairs."87.255.68.7,0.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â  Â I think that primary message of this game is to show that everything costs time and money. So you must invest in research, protection and insurance and balance those to minimize costs in order to achieve some confidence that risk effect will have a low impact.Â Â  Â Another point is about time. This game also point that time is going so if you loose the opportunity and do not make a right decision at right time the risk impact will grow exponentially. Â  Â  To summarize this game outlines three subjects which you have to deal with in risk management: Resources (money)TimeBalance between Development, Research, Protection, Insurance and TimeResources.Another question is about play this game once and play it again. What do I would do differently?It depends if the second time will be identically as first time I mean that the same meteors will hit the same place so everything will be repeated. In this way will know how things will evolve and choose the best strategy in order to meet the game objective.But in real life the things happens differently with a random probability. And we are not able to predict or know in advance what will happen. Â Also during this game you can find that early investigation in risk preparation have a big impact on development. So you should assume a risk tolerance threshold and start invest into risk preparation after reach this threshold. In this way you'll have some money in order to keep or raise development. Â So if I will be tasked to develop a new game version I'll add a new parameter risk tolerance. For sure it will introduce some complexity into game but it will describe better how we deal with project management in real life. Also the game didn't reveal theÂ abstraction or the root cause of the problem in risk management. It doesn't show that we try with finite characteristics timemoney to solve or control infinite sets of factors which affect or have an impact on Development and Risk management.As a result of this game or knowledge that can be applied in real life in my environment or place where I live, I want to emphasize the following: Â  We always can find a way to deal with effects of undesirable phenomenons. Just make the right decisions at the right time and do not loose the opportunities.

Which initself can be seen as a learning process, developing knowledge of risks in thegame and how to handle them. Making a tradeoff between spending time on thisgame, and other obligations in my life.Within the game I first triedto research the objective of the game, earning points within the limited timeframe: building and upgrading as many structures as soon as possible. Soon Ifound out â€œlivingâ€ù this game this way, did not help, while I suffered from theattacks from the sky. On the other hand, trying to protect myself as much aspossible, did not help too, while the game was over before I reached the next objectivelevel.In my opinion, within thisgame, the insurance policy did not really help me. Facing a high impact risk Ishould manage by myself (with increase of protection level on time), or whenthat seemed impossible, by researching enough to gain time to improveprotection after impact. I learned about this last possibility only after sometime. When a new risk appeared I imaginedI could not handle, doing research was a better way to solve the situation onthe short term. However this protection gained after impact was notsustainable. So I preferred preparing myself for any situation by investing inprotection on forehand. Therefor when there were no immediate threats, I spendmoney on increasing protection to get a Â´safety levelÂ´.Based on this I soon made upmy strategy:Spend enough money onbuilding structures to work on my goal, but leave some safety margin on resourcesfor protection.Have a quick first assessmentof all new â€œrisksâ€ù entering the sky, to decide the size of (possible) impact andthe chance this will occur.Based on this firstknowledge decide how to face the situation: no action needed (while risk is lowor I think I can handle the effect), or action is needed, either by researchingmore or to increase protection level.But in the meantime, building andupgrading new structures were essential to gain enough resources and get to thenext level of the game. During the different times I played the game, I neversucceeded to get to the next level, when some of the buildings were damaged.This gave me the very unconformableidea if this is also true for real life situations, people who are confrontedwith some life threatening event, they cannot overcome without help themselves.When their houses are damaged, or other basic needs to survive, they probablyhave not enough Â´energyÂ´ (or other resources) left to be able to survive newrisks. And that is not a gameâ€_Living in Western Europemyself, I feel very luckily to face less life threatening risks due to naturaldisasters like some other parts of the world. I think for my part of the world,it can be interesting to play this game with the possibility to adjust thevelocity and impact of threats coming from the sky. Coping with a tradeoff betweenthe risk level you are accepting to take and the benefits you can gain when youaccept more risk. Feeling â€˜totally safeâ€™ is probably a state of happiness, butone should not fall asleep, not aware of the impact of a risk which can happenanywayâ€_.Â "220.237.17.178,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Risk Horizon managed to successfully complete level 4 The purpose of the game was to examine a number of variablesunder the heading of knowledge, protection and insurance. The players objectivewas to minimise my exposure to risk while maximising my opportunity to developthe community. You had to weigh up insurance, education of meteorites,building, available funds, repairs, and raising the land levels.I found the best way for me to reach level 4 was principallythrough protection- tacking appropriate action to raise the land level. It tookme several goes to find that the best way. what I thought was the most straightforward was not the way I eventually found workedI learned to read the meteorites and then take appropriate actionin raising the floor level of the village. It was time consuming and did costsome money but I found it to be the best strategy,I also learnt that I couldnâ€™t just focus on completing one buildingat a time and I had to put my money on building many structures as I could. Istarted off building and extending just a couple of houses at the time but thegame required me to spread my money around. I also found insurance was important and I took it out eachtime. I never took out full coverage but I did spread the risk around The game was an evolution in strategy. I learnt that it wasa process of seeing what was working and what wasnâ€™t. Â I learned that I was dealing the immediatethreats and had to change strategy to tackle more preventative measures likesea levels. The main things I learnt from the game was to try somethingout and make adjustments. I learnt insurance and education were important but not as importantas adjusting the floor level of the area. If I had the floor level at the rightheight then I actually didnâ€™t need insurance but I still took some out just incaseI might if I wanted to look at loss of life as a result ofthe activity.

First of all, I whould like to say, that the Risk Horizon game, is interesting and quite enjoying. I really liked it. But at the same time I do not understand much about it at all. It takes me several hours to get to some desent level (like 4th, or 5th). I am not sure how is this working. The game is all about the risk management and your decisions and chances, which we can not control. I have tried to stay in the middle - to continue developing the planet and do a lot of researches. When the hit probability was really high I bought some insurance. But money is still not enough. There was not good explanation of how to play this game, or what should we do in the beginning. And the game was not properly working on my PC. Preparation for risk sometimes comes affect development and sometimes simultaniously. I was not figure it out. I was constantly switching, so I am not sure.2. I have played the Risk Horizon game not only once. As I mentioned above, I have waisted several hours trying so hard to succeed. I was trying to do different techniques - like to build only one house, and developing just it. But it was not working. Than I switched , and decided to build all of the buildings, and than developing them. And always taking into account the possibility of risk. I still do not know how to balance in this game. I learned that everything is unstable, and sometimes it is not in your hands to control everything. Moreover, you should be ok with the results you have had. Learn from your mistakes and go on. Risks is a must, but most of the time it is not worthy the actions . Sometimes you win, sometimes you do not. It depends. (your luck or your constant actions - still have not decided yet).3. In this game I would add a manual. I I do not really get this game at all. What was I doing was baised on my observation and from my mistakes in the game. I have not seen the connection between the risk managing and the game. I was paying insurance, developing the houses and doing a lot of research and did not find the answer. The risk happenned either way, no matter what was I doing or not doing.

The variables are Knowledge of opportunities or risks, Protection mechanisms and Insurance (Coping mechanisms). The higher the risk the higher the investment in the coping mechanisms and gaining knowledge of the situation (issue) to maximize resources for damage control and a speedy recovery and vice versa. There is no perfect solution possible, only optimal strategies.From the game perspective the following scenarios emerge -a. High severity of the comet hitting and a high chance of that event happeningIf the  comet is moving slower there is more time to research and adjust the  parameters - this is indicative of having more time to focus on preparation  and coping with an inevitable disaster    Focus on coping and protection - increase research for minimizing impact by  getting more time to deal with the aftermath, maximize insurance for faster  recovery.    If the comet is moving faster maximize insurance and increase research  commensurate with that speed.

Medium severity of the comet hitting and a Medium chance of that event happeningIf the  comet is moving slower there is more time to research and adjust the  parameters.     Focus on coping - increase research to match the chance of the hit,  increase insurance commensurate with the developing threat.     If the comet is moving faster maximize insurance, increase research but  stay focused on increasing pod growth activityThe  focus here is on having a balanced  use of resources between opportunity versus minimizing damage to community  outreach, research and building coping mechanismsc. Low severity of the comet hitting and a Low chance of that event happeningFocus more on pod growth to increase opportunity and resources.

Gamers have to learn to balance risk and choose the rate of development. The comets were coming at a great pace, but in order to move to the next level you need to integrate knowledge, insurance, and protection to move forward.Â The power of knowledge was readily apparent when tracking the comets. As a gamer, you are forced to access theÂ severityÂ of the risk of the comet asÂ well as likelihood of impact. Those factorsÂ weighedÂ heavily since you only had so much to invest in development or purchasing insurance. AÂ misallocation of resources could quickly sent a player back from the goal of reaching the next level. Interpreting the research accurately is the power of knowledge. Although, as a gamer, I felt I understood what the likelihood and severity meant. After, playing a few rounds, I could start to get better at knowing when to hold off on buying insurance and instead invest inÂ development. Understanding what information was being provided and then being able to act on it in timely matter is central to the game and to application of risk management in development.As in risk management, there were different forms of insurance that could be used to mitigate the potential cost of a comet strike. At first, I would always buy the insurance with the highest premium. However, after a couple of rounds, I could see that buying the most expensive insurance didn't necessarily guarantee success. You need to allocate just the right amount to get the desired result.The direct correlation to insurance in development is readily apparent. If you are buying insurance to guard against a lost of crops, for instance, but don't have enough money left to plant more it is self defeating. Another example would be, is if the likelihood and severity of bad outcome is minimal then reducing your insurance payment could be used to plant more. The trade-offs have to be dealt with and then assigned the proper weight to determine how much insurance to buy.Â The role of protection in the game could have been more straight forward. Although, the elements of insurance and knowledge are very explicit. It took me a couple of rounds playing to realize, I was making the protection decisions perhaps I should have thought of this anyway. However, to someone that doesn't read all the directions, like me, it was apparent the slider actually raised a lowered the island.Â Overall, the game was fun and learned to see the concept of risk management in different setting that will help through the rest of the course.Â "41.73.234.181,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in this game is likable to the type that is found in an organizational setting in their day to day operations.The uncertain economic times of the past few years have had a major effect on how companies operate these days. Companies that used to operate smoothly with the help of forecasts and projections now refrain from making business judgements that are set in stone. Now, companies have a renewed focus: to manage risk.Risk is the main cause of uncertainty in any organisation. Thus, companies increasingly focus more on identifying risks and managing them before they even affect the business. The ability to manage risk will help companies act more confidently on future business decisions. Their knowledge of the risks they are facing will give them various options on how to deal with potential problems.Risk can come from both internal and external sources. The external risks are those that are not in direct control of the management. These include political issues, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. Internal risks, on the other hand, include non-compliance or information breaches, among several others.Risk management is important in an organisation because without it, a firm cannot possibly define its objectives for the future. If a company defines objectives without taking the risks into consideration, chances are that they will lose direction once any of these risks hit home.In recent years, many companies have added risk management departments to their team. The role of this team is to identify risks, come up with strategies to guard against these risks, to execute these strategies, and to motivate all members of the company to cooperate in these strategies. Larger organizations generally face more risks, so their risk management strategies also need to be more sophisticated. Also, the risk management team is responsible for assessing each risk and determining which of them are critical for the business. The critical risks are those that could have an adverse impact on the business; these should then be given importance and should be prioritized. The whole goal of risk management is to make sure that the company only takes the risks that will help it achieve its primary objectives while keeping all other risks under control. If I were to play this game again, I will approach it more cautiously taking into cognizance those experiences that I have garnered from my first attempt. Organizations face internal and external actors and influences that make it uncertain whether, when, and the extent to which they will achieve or exceed their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on the organisationâ€™s objectives is risk.As president and owner of Heuer Insurance Company in Sparks, Larry Heuer is well aware of the catastrophic losses businesses have the potential to experience if they donâ€™t practice appropriate risk management. As an example of sound risk management, however, he chooses to remember a client who suffered a large loss due to a fire caused by a tenant in one of his upscale apartment complexes. â€œThis was a very bad claim, but the client had the right amount of coverage,â€ù1 Heuer explains. Having the right amount of coverage meant that the client avoided having to reach into his own pocket to pay for tens of thousands of dollars for the extensive damage to his property. â€œThe purpose of insurance is putting you in the same position after the loss as before,â€ù2 Heuer says.1:The importance of risk management in business,www.nevadabusiness.com/.../risk-management-a-necessary-consideration.,br2:ibid."129.108.202.60,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,http://youtu.be/EJBPq2atjVksorry if the sound is a bit off.

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Answer 1:Â The role of risk management in thegame was to prepare for the losses due to risk of comet and meteor hitting, tomake use of insurance intelligently to minimize the damages, and to invest inadequate research. For low chances of hit and low severity, I invested more inresearch. For high chances of hit, or high severity, I tried to invest inmoderate insurance. For both high chances of hit and high severity, I investedin buying highest insurance. When, I bought highest insurance protection, theredevelopment costs were low in the event of a comet or meteor strike.Question 2: If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?Answer 2: Given that I played the game morethan once, my main learning from the game was:1.Â Â Â Investment in insurance helps inmanaging the damages due to risk.2.Â Â Â Community protection helps inminimizing the losses due to risks.3.

I find this game very useful, because it showed me how important key components of risk - knowledge, protection, insurance, coping are.Â Â  In the game we had three main tools to use to manage risk - research, the power of protection and insurance. Research - when we notice a comet via research we were able to see the chance ot the comet hitting, and the severity of the comet. Knowing this information we could click the certain comet and elongate the time we have for community connections and thus boost our protection.Protection - In the game we had a button which we pressed to make equal comet severity and our level of protection and to protect from damage our pods. This costed us money so we were not able to press it to maximum protection.Insurance - we could use this tool to lower the costs when repairing the damaged pods. Having limited resources (money) we could not have maximum protection all the time soÂ the knowledgeÂ and research were very important toÂ make our decisions.Â Every level was more difficult than the previous one - it had more comets and we had to think and act faster. The game helped me understand the importance of every phase - before, during and after the disaster and also to realize how difficult is to observe all the time the chance of disaster and to continue developing - building and upgrading pods at the same time.Â "217.129.9.204,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"I have played the Risk Horizon game, and now I will address the three questions asked. I will start with the first question, regarding the role of risk management in the game. To do this, I will first provide a short description of the game. The game consists on an area where the player can build a limited number of pods that will become a community. Those pods are the wealth pools, the goal is to reach a certain amount of wealth. Comets can sometimes be seen in the sky, and if they hit, they can cause damage to the community, they reduce wealth and the damage has to be repaired, which also costs. The game has some tools, like an insurance, that can cover part of the damage, and also prevention that can meet the predicted severity of the impact. As for the meteors themselves, once they can be seem, you can check how sever its impact can be and how likely it is to hit. If a comet hits, you have sometime, limited by how much you researched the comet, to build links between individual members of the community, and these reduce the damage level.Â I will now address the role of risk management in the game. The role of risk management in the game involves having the right information about the comet, investing in the protection and insurance, but also on the size of the community, since more links between individuals lead to less damage. But also having a minimum amount of money to effect the repairs. It also involves upgrading the pods, to have more wealth. I decided to have insurance from the beginning, started with a small number of pods that I upgraded to higher levels and then built more pods, and always met the severity of the comet before impact.Now as to what I learned from the game, it seems I did not learn much, but it was a chance to see whether I had fully understood the concepts taught in this course. I played the game twice and I would not have changed anything if I were to play again.If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would had different types of risk, so different types of comets and I would try that the management also involves different levels according to the risk that is being faced."87.65.159.184,6.0 to 10.0,0.0 to 2.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of the risk ,management in the game was to evaluate the relation between possible damage and the price of insurance and to learn from research how to two affect each other.I played the game several times and I learned how to insure big impacts and to avoid insurance for missesl I also used the knowledge I have gathered from the research:I would enlarge the role of research on the outcome of the game; since this is what also happens in real life situations:"91.228.169.254,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"I think the role of risk management in the game was underlined by insurance and knowledge practices. As a player, I was supposed to get prepared for disasters caused by meteors by increasing my knowledge about them. IÂ noticed that meteors caused lower damages in cases where I made adequate researches. Because their severity level was reducing in that cases.Â However, I could not do anything to reduce severity as the chances of hit was so high that there was nothing I could do by increasing my knowledge. In that cases, the more appropriate instrument was insurance which help me recover my damages quickly.Â Another point I liked about the game was the chance and resource factors that were embedded to the game quite successfully. My money was saving by time and I had to make good choices to use my resources effectively and appropriately.

Difficult choices must be made, with both intended and unintended consequences. The game was educational and fun to play, and I played to date 4 times. Discussed below are the manners in which I did play the game and how the strategy changed over time with the new consequences highlighted.When I first began playing the Risk Horizon game, I did not purchase any insurance just to see if it were possible to build as many pods as possible and then begin to upgrade afterwards. I also clustered the pods close together. These aforementioned measures, were both examples was a poor strategy indeed and it resulted in my losing level 2. The next time I played I still did not purchase insurance but I did focus only on building a few pods and then I worried about upgrading as fast as I could to increase earnings from property values. This aforementioned strategy also resulted in me losing level 2. It was not until I purchased insurance (the most expensive but most comprehensive kind) and I focused on building a median amount of pods quite distant from each other, with a focus on upgrading did I make it to level 3. The addition of insurance seems to be the independent variable necessary, where rebuilding was subsidized and recouping losses was more manageable. I saw a number of opportunity costs, which according to Investopedia (2014) means, and I quote: ""The cost of an alternative that must be forgone in order to pursue a certain action. Put another way, the benefits you could have received by taking an alternative action."" In other words, when I spent more money on insurance and upgrading pods, I could not build as many, or when I built more pods I could not repair as many. Also, in accordance with the course lectures and game description I had diminishing returns, where, as the levels progressed, and pods were fixed, formerly, the associated costs went up and my money lost value over time for repairs to be made.I learned then that insurance is a necessity.If I were to assist in upgrading the game and making it more realistic, I would add pixelÂ augmentation (improveÂ pix-elationÂ for better graphics)Â and related techniques to make the game more real life and convincing. I would also add a more sophisticated algorithm able to give more detailed and sophisticated instructions so that the game would adapt toÂ individualÂ players and provide more complex, real world challenges. I would add risk from flooding from the water as one example. Â Still, I found the game already a challenge, as of yet, I have not moved beyond level 3.ReferencesÂ Investopedia (2014) Opportunity Cost.

It simulates risk management against systemic risks. In the game your goal is to reach a certain level of development while managing the constant overhanging danger of meteors potentially crashing into the planet. To increase you development level you have to spend funds, which you acquire over time (based on your development level). Managing the risk of crashing meteors are split in three: Knowledge, protection and insurance, and are represented by: Studying the meteors by selecting it, and therefor more accurately explaining the risk it poses. Using funds to raise your ""city"" on a hill, protecting it from waves caused by a meteor. And lastly insurance which gives you back 33, 50 or 75% of the damage, regarding what insurance level you buy.I used these three methods in the following way: Protection, to see what kind of threat the meteor posed. Knowledge was the base of my risk management and I acted out from what knowledge I was able do deduct from the meteors. Also knowledge seemed to give a ""double"" benefit in the game, as it both gave you a better idea of how the meteor was going to affect you, and it gave you more time to mobilize the community. After acquiring knowledge, i went to protection. If i could up my protection was within a certain range of what power the meteor could be hitting with, I would up my protection to counter the meteor impact. Lastly i used Insurance as a last backup. If i had problems getting my protection up to the level needed, or there were too many meteor at one time to manage. The fourth thing, not focused on in the game or tutorial, but which i noticed while playing was always keeping a bit of capital at hand. If you always spent your last funds on upgrading pods, then I had no money left for restoration for the the shit hit the fan. This seemed to be another aspect of knowledge which the game does not specify, but is significant when playing. My first time trying the game I lost at level 1. I think this is because I had to experience how the game managed, and how the different things worked and affected gameplay. Afterwards I thought of it as yet another part of knowledge needed to play the game properly. The next try, I made it all the way to level 4. So with added knowledge, I could quickly address the risks.If I were to redevelop the game, I would add a focus, or a little reminder after you have played to make sure that people playing it also noticed that knowledge about saving funds and understanding after experience also aided you in beating the game. So knowledge should really be the baseline for all risk assessment. I think in the place that I live. UsingÂ  knowledge and experience to determine risks and handling these risks (and unforeseen ones) is underestimated. The ability to make a buffer part of your risk assessment is very important in my view."97.65.53.253,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â  I had a difficult time balancing risk managment and development.Â  For example, I found it difficult to develop enough cash to buy the insurance I needed when I saw a comet coming.Â  I noticed that the insurance I needed was often a very few dollars more than I had.Â  I tried waiting to purchase the insurance, but the money count did not add upwards as I waited.Â  I also found it difficult to raise the land, which is the solution for long-term safety.Â  I did notice that repairs wereÂ quick and inexpensive after buying insurance.Â Â If I could see the whole screen again, I would be very slow to raise the island in the early stages.Â Â Trying to raise the island early in the game costÂ a lot of money and seemed to turn the left bar red.Â  I would also spend more time researching the comets.Â  Additionally, I would save more money for insurance when the most severe comets with the higher levels of certainty to impact were coming.Â  In summary, it was hard to balance development with knowledge, protection and insurance.Â  Protection came from raising the island level and also researching the comets enough to have time for community action after the impacts.Â  The knowledge gained from researching the comet helped decrease the damage and the insurance protection made the damage decrease or at least it made rebuilding after damage less expensive and more rapid.2.Â  I played the game many, manyÂ times.Â  I played at least 20 times.Â  I found that it was important to do all the elements simultaneously.Â  It was important to use the research, insurance, and raising the level while also trying to develop enough to have sufficient cash to afford the protection efforts.3.Â  I had a lot of technical trouble seeing the game.  I experienced a tonÂ of difficulty seeing the top and bottom of the screen.  Many times this made it impossible to see the comets until they were almost landing and I could not see the cash balance or the insurance information.  In all, the technical difficulty made the ""game""Â extremely frustrating.Â  I suggest adding some diagnostics to see if the student's computer has the appropriate resolution and sizing while loading the game.Â Â  I also suspect that the best thing for long-term development, raising the island, was too expensive early in the game.Â  Raising the island (protection) made the bar on the left side drop from a high level of green to a low level and red.Â  Also, there were many times when the insurance would not respond to my selection.Â  This took valauble time and prevented other efforts while trying to purchase insurance.If I would suggest one simple change, it would be to give the price of raising the island more clearly.Â  I could not find out the cost of raising the island by a bar or half a bar, etc.Â  That would have made the choice of when to attempt raising the island more clear.Â Â Â I would often try to raise the island in the last seconds before impact because it was the only action I could take quickly.Â  Then it would change the cash balance.Â  It seemed like the income and the expenses would change quickly, but I could not figure why the income was increasing and decreasing quickly in the last moments.Â Â "110.38.137.48,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.

Each pod has a cost to build, and as these pods are built, the initial sum is reduced by the cost of the built pod.  While pod building, comets appear in the sky, headed for the island.  To win the game, the player needs to build pods to a designated value and protect the built pods from losing value below this needed value. Pod value is reduced by damage done by colliding comets.  The player has 2 and 1/2 minutes to achieve the need value.Each comet, as it appears in the sky, has knowledge associated with it.  This knowledge includes the damage severity to the pods if the comet collides with the island and the chance of comet collision.  The player needs to use this knowledge to decide on options the player has to minimize the damage that a collided comet will have on the built pods.The options to minimize the damage to the pods from the comets are to obtain protection and/or to obtain insurance.  The player can obtain protection, but to do so requires time.  Time is important because the game lasts only 2 and 1/2 minutes.  Obtaining protection requires substantial time that could otherwise be used to build pods.   In order to win the game, the total value of the pods built needs to reach a designated level within the 2 and 1/2 minutes.However, increasing the pod-built total value takes time.  So, there is a time-used tradeoff between building pods and obtaining protection.  Obtaining too much protection might mean not leave enough time building pods to reach the required pod-built value.  Not enough time building protection increases the potential damage to the built pods when a comet collides with the island.The knowledge provided to the player on each comet is crucial in deciding how much protection should be obtained. The knowledge includes the damage severity on the built pods if the comet hits the island and the chance of island collision by the comet.  This knowledge is a guide to the player on how much time to build up protection â€“ the higher the severity and the collision chance â€“ the more protection (and time) needed.Should a collision seem likely, and if the player believes that protection may be insufficient to minimize the pod damage on collision, the player can buy insurance, using up some of the funds and time otherwise needed to build pods.  The purchased insurance, however, will reduce the severity of the pod damage from the colliding comet and protect some of the value of the pods.The strategy I would use, and eventually did use, after playing the game initially, would be to obtain sufficient protection where comets with high damage severity and collision chance appear.  A key point learned is to quickly obtain knowledge on each comet and to be concerned about those comets that have high severity damage and collision chance.In a new version of the game, I would put more emphasis on being able to reduce the chance of collision as I acquired more knowledge about the risk (the comet).  This new aspect to the game models well actual conditions where more knowledge often helps prevent the risk (the collision) from taking place."74.76.21.37,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 30.0,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,12.0 to 37.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"1) The role of risk management was to effectively protect and develop the pods to higher levels by utilizing the available resources efficiently to balance research, protection and insurance levels without affecting the growth. Some of the choices that I made are performing more research and increasing the knowledge about the meteors(risk) so that there is enough time to increase the community support and thereby increasing the protection without actually buying protection which saved resources and thereby helped in faster development, increasing knowledge and protection to neutralize the damage which saved insurance money, buying insurances when there was not enough time to research or not enough resources to buy protection there by reducing the damage, spending more time on researching risks with higher severity and chances of hit ranks sometimes lead to wastage of research time since the meteors didn't hit at the end and not doing enough research on low chances of hit meteors lead to damage since those meteors end up hitting at the end. The trade-offs that I confronted are whether to spend the resources to increase the protection level and have little or no insurance or try to increase the insurance and depend on research to increase protection which will save resources upfront that will help faster development and insurance will decrease the damage, whether to research a short-term risk with lower severity and higher chances of hit or to research a long-term risk with high severity and low chance of hit etc. whether to always maintain a higher protection level by spending more resources to avoid risk totally or to prepare for effective post risk situation through insurance for reducing the damage and getting back to development quickly by letting the risk to hit or happen. Buying maximum protection and insurance upfront without exactly knowing the severity of the risk and lead to wastage of resources in the initial stage that effected development. Too much of focus on risk avoidance might also be wasteful if the risk didn't happen. Having maximum insurance without proper protection also increased damages. Since, development has to happen within the specified time limit spending too much resource with out proper research and knowledge of how to handle each risk affected the development.Â 2) I played the many times and every time I learned something new and changed my strategies every time. There is always room for improving or perfecting risk management techniques. First time I didn't have complete knowledge about the game then I didn't focus on the development level and time limit then I spent a lot on increasing the protection and having maximum insurance to mitigate risk but failed to develop then I had maximum insurance and did research but failed to have good protection etc., After many iteration I was able to find an optimal solution that had a good balance of growth, knowledge, protection and insurance.I learnt that all the elements of risk management are equally important and above all development is more important than just risk management alone. First thing that is needed is enough knowledge about the risk and how to mitigate the risk. I also learnt that there are situations that are so uncertain that it is difficult to fully prepare for it but it is necessary to learn from the previous experiences and try to reduce the damage so the recovery can be made easier.3) I think the game has already covered all the aspects of risk management choices in my place and I don't think there is anything that I would want to change."87.241.53.82,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The gameallows you to develop a community that faces only one type of risk, comets.

Likewise, progressive preparations and by solidifying the pods based on the level of impact, Research and Protection; which are the decisions necessary to help keep the pods from utmost destruction after the meteor hits and shock wave released.Â Risk Management also helped me in making important decisions like which pods receives more attention after the damage is done.I learnt that Risk management will help weather the storm of eventualities and keep my investment in progress instead of spending resources on repairing damages, I am able to spend in expanding my investments portfolio and build wealth easily and not trying to start from scratch due to careless research results or inaccurate assessment evauation of my Risks. Â Â b. I made the choices of start building pods far from the edge of island instead of at the coastal fronts.Â  I also made sure after building pods close to the shores or edge, they receive adequate fortification first before attending to the rest pods offshore.I insured mostly with 50%-75% which covered for most of the damages. And moreover my protection plan (holding the button up) was almost immediately before impact, which enabled me build and reinforce my pods before impact of the meteor. Â c. Preparation for Risk affected the development of newer pods because, I had to reinforce the older pods that were to be damaged on impact of a meteor.Â The insurance of each pod can be increased or reduced depending on the Research carried out on the severity of impact of a meteor; and also the time spent on protection can be ascertained.Â 2. Since, I played the game more than once I started building my pods at the mainland far from the the shore, because these are the areas that are far from an impact/shock-wave of a meteor and whenever I built a new pod close to the shores I built a better fortification for them.I learnt that since Risks are inevitable due to voluntary and natural causes, then Risk management should also be an inevitable plan by us preparation and cushioning the effects of the impending danger or disaster. Â  Â I learnt that Research, helps me access the Â magnitude of the Risk and gives me an edge in preparing adequately with Risk management tools e.g Insurance plans, which invariably gives me peace of mind and reduces or takes care of my loss on the advent of a catastrophe. Reinforcing of pods on the mainland helps me reduce damage level of the shock-wave, though it also reduced the building of newer pods.I reduced my insurance plans depending on the results of my Research in accessing an incoming meteor which invariably reduced my cost on the insurance and left me enough money to spend on building and reinforcing more pods that needs attention. Â 3. If I were to create an upgraded version of the game, I will add most importantly a section where players have the choices of materials for building tougher pods that will reduce impact.I will make available options to slow down or divert the incoming danger, probably by shooting at the meteor or creating spaces on ground to cushion their impact.There should also be avenue to create physical shock absorbs options before impact. Â Options to better represent my Risk Management choices will be several Protection options instead of just one.Time frame can be increased of reduced depending on the level of Protection, the more the protection the shorter the time frame of impact and vise-visa.Â  Â  Â Â "181.64.149.150,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"1.

I thoughtthat, that strategy would increase my rate of development quickly and thecapacity to generate more money, so I would be able to pass to the next leveleasily and with the money obtained with the upgraded pods, I would constructlater the rest of the community. And that strategy was correct to reach tolevel 2 or 3, but it didnÂ´t worked in level 4 because when there were damagesby the impact of a severe comet, in spite of having cheap insurance and a mediumlevel of protection (because I had spent many money in the development), thecost and the time of repairing them was very high due to the high level ofdevelopment.Ichanged the strategy in my 5th game and developed more pods, and allof them with a grade of development according to the level of the game, and developingall pods to the same level. So I had money in â€œmy pocketâ€ù to protect and buy agood insurance in case a severe comet was coming.3.

This game is incorporates several levels of risk management. To succeed in the game, you must balance resilience with prosperity, while maintaining enough wealth to move to the next level. It illustrates the decisions that some people have to make daily to lead their households, companies, cities, and countries. It's impossible to know what it is like to be in a situation where you decide the fate of your country, but the RiskHorizon game makes you think about the choices you make.Â I had to sacrifice protection and insurance in order to develop and move on to the next level if the game. It was all connected and difficult to let go of what you wanted to accomplish to move on to the next level. I had to sacrifice knowledge and protection to make enough money to develop my island.It was difficult for me to play thisÂ game as a person who tends to be averse to risk and from a developed country. When I first started playing, I spent my time and money on protection of the island and insurance, but quickly found that I could not make it far with this strategy. For several rounds, I tried to see how much time and money I could spend protecting the island and still make it to round 2. I did make it to round 2 half of the time, but was stuck there with not enough pods to move forward. I began to concentrate on development and then beat level 2. however, after repeated tries, I never beat level 3.2. I played the game more times than I care to admit. After the first few tries, I concentrated more on development and less on protection and insurance. During construction, I did research. I also switched browser (from Chrome to Firefox), which aided me in beating level 2. I learned a lot from the game. I learned that development was important to risk management. I could not move up a level by protecting by island alone, I had to invest in my pods and learn from my research in order to reach prosperity.Â 3. If I were to add something to the game, it would be education. As it is, the game takes into account development, natural disaster, protection, and insurance. Education is a preventative measure that can affect several aspects of risk management. The game is difficult, but simplified. It does not incorporate education, human rights, knowledge, skills, and other necessary elements for success."84.114.69.81,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"1) The risk management was a crucial part of being successful with the game. Â A more cautious building/improving strategy was necessary in order to invest in protection and insurance. Â Initially protection was the most important action because of the small incremental cost. Â Afterwards, insurance purchased based on the research information about the likelihood of impact and the expected damage was important. Â Specifically, if a high-risk and high severity comet was coming, I would stop any building in order to save the necessary resources to purchase an appropriate insurance plan.2) If playing again, I would more accurately evaluate the potential impact of the comets and perhaps increase the amount of building done. Â After level 2, I was very cautious and rarely had any damage - perhaps it would have been more successful if I had better weighted the consequences and been willing to accept slightly more risk.Â 3) Â Additionally, while a comet's impact is obviously a good way to show risk, and purchasing insurance is a point that was supposed to be made more clear, there didn't seem to be enough importance placed on for example infrastructure improvements. Â For example, governments when choosing how to invest must also pay attention to public opinion - so perhaps a change to the game would be to have ""newspaper headlines"" giving information on ""public opinion"" about how the current government is spending the tax dollars *e.g. enough on public works, or insurance, etc. Â A point in the video was that governments have a hard time investing in some risk avoidance measures because it is less tangible. Â This isn't a main aspect of the game and would be important to improve.The game seems to be geared towards a younger crowd, which is fine on the one hand.

I realized that the task had different levels, Initial development and upgrades. I had to make a trade offI had to avoid complete development of plots but instead developed five (5) out of nine (9) of the land mass and applied more resources into the quality of the developed plots as well as purchasing the highest available insurance cover for the developed plots. I also raised my island to match the level of protection and as a result had minimal loss during attacks.Â I felt that a higher quality of infrastructure and insurance was a lot better than developing more plots with less quality of development and lower insurance cover.I played the game twice and in the first instance i developed more plots and had less quality of development since most of my resources went into base development and insurance cover.The main thing I learnt from the game is that one always has to think like the economist in Lionel Robbins which seeks to handle the relationship between ends and scarce means that have alternative uses. Considering that economics is a social science dealing with humans and circumstances are not always the same, I was able to look at the similarities in the first and second attempt at the game but able to distinctly handle them in the context of present realities and simply not expect that the situation i met in the first attempt would be exactly the same as the case in the second.I also appreciated the concept of insurance as it helped lower my rebuild cost in the situation that i had suffered some damage. I usually opted for maximum cover.I can summarize my strategy as1. Build on less than 60% of available land mass2. Develop the plots built to at least a level 4 building status3.

Forexample, I had the knowledge of comets hitting my town (that was the risk) andinsurance was my protection.

In order to reach the target, the appropriate risk management was indispensible. Since all kinds of risk management cost the limited resources and each way cost differently, in the lower level, I mainly chose to use the Protection which is a long-term investment and can effectively prevent my pods form being damaged by those small comets. As the level was rising, the severity of the comet was higher and hit chance was also rising. In the mean time, My community was full of built pods, each possible shock would bring me the unexpectable huge damage.And thus, I had to use the Insurance to transfer the damage and reduce the loss. During the game, I found the Research was not so effective, so I rarely used that and I could save more resources to develop my community.I had played the game twice. At the fist time, I tried to get familiar with the rule and assessed the effect of different kinds of risk manangement ways. Then I found the Research was some kind useless. At the second try, with the experiment from the first time, I reduced the use of the Research, increased the use of the Protection and bought the more expensive insurence when the level began higher. And later I successfully finished the expected task.Â I thought the most main thing I learned from the game was that I should control the trade-off between the gains and losses and make a right risk management plan before doing whatever.Â When I make risk management plan in the real life, I always hope there would be a way which can thoroughly avoid the all risk forever. In this game, the Alora is faced with theÂ threat ofÂ tidal waveÂ caused by the comets, so whether is there some kind risk management to prevent the Alora from being hit?

It was difficult at first to recognize what defenses worked best against different types of comets with different risks of impact.

When I adjusted my strategy later in the game, my results were better.2. I spent a lot more time doing research the second time I played.

Â During the course of play, I found it to be a good idea put most of my research into comets with a high likelihood of impact and that also have a high severity of impact. Â Higher severity comets would require more time to connect the colony and raise it. Â Additionally, the speed of the comet played a factor as slower moving comets could be dealt with in between making improvements and increasing protection. Â The most immediate concerns were providing for protection rather than researching the comets, as without anything to protect, comet research is pointless. Â That being said, each time I worked towards disaster preparation, the growth of the colony slowed.I played through the game twice. Â The first time I was unable to meet the growth quota for the fifth level, and both times I never took any damage. Â I learned the best thing to do was build many small developments at the beginning so I would have the cash flow to make improvements. Â Additionally, were I to take any damage, any repairs would be inexpensive. Â My first protection moves were to raise the colony a few levels up. Â I then followed the comet strategy mentioned above. Â I only bought insurance when it appeared that a fast moving, high intensity comet was going to hit me and I wouldn't be able to research sufficiently. Â It turned out this was unnecessary. Â My growth strategy was to let my money accumulate while researching the most severe comets and then growing many structures simultaneously. Â I would raise the colony only if it dropped back to the white bars. Â This strategy worked as I would not only meet my quota but also exceed it greatly giving me a large surplus to start the next level with.The game does an excellent job of forcing the player to actively switch between required activities. Â The form of each part of the game made it impossible to ignore any part entirely. Â I don't know if it was just my strategy that prevented my needing the insurance or a game mechanic, but I might try to find a new way to have the insurance make more of an impact. Â For future versions, maybe you could explore adding complexity to the game. Â It might not be something one can do in a short ""real-time strategy"" game, but adding different kinds of threats to the mix could or additional ways of protecting the colony would be interesting and convey the scale of difficulty risk managers face.

Effective risk managementapproaches can not only protect the poor â€“ they can also unlock opportunitiesfor better development outcomes.To achieve the objectiveof the game which is to develop community to the best of the ability,risk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with theability to cope once a risk has appeared. Preparation Â includes a combination of three actions thatcan be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge (gathering information and making judgmentsabout risk); obtaining protection (to influence the likelihood and magnitude ofrisk); and obtaining insurance (to transfer resources between good and badperiods).In the game we must findthe balance between growing the community and preparing for potential shocks (cometscareen into the water and cause waves that hinder development).Acquiring knowledge is thepower to look out into space and accumluate research (learn the chance of the comet hitting, thetime until impact, and the severity of the comet).Â With each extra point, wereceive more time to create community connections right before the comet hits,helping boost the protection.By matching the level ofprotection against the waves with the severity of the comet, we can prevent pods from beingdamaged (by raising the island).By obtaining insurance,pods damaged from flooding will be quicker and cheaper to rebuild. Insurancealso recovers lost development time after you pods are repaired.By using these threepowers in concert with development, we will help create a healthy community. Theonly way to succeed is to find the perfect balance between these three powers,but it isnâ€™t so easy. Each action takes time and has cost that can be used tomake another action, achieving another (sometimes better) result.Â This isoften a simple cost vs. benefits formula. With good preparation, onlyminimal coping may be needed to recover quicklyâ€” leaving more resources available for investment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks. Coping actions include updating knowledge and then deploying any insurance and protection.Â "60.225.165.196,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management is essentially the act of balancing between opportunities for growth and protection/management of threats. Trade-offs for money exist between building (upgrading)  a new pod or buying insurance or increasing protection, and/or research. The later two also create a trade-off for time - creating protection and research take both time to establish which means you have to stay with only one thing. There were potential for optimisation: ie if I knew the meteorite to be of minor severity I could increase my protection instead of researching the meteorite - this would be able to protect me against future meteorites of similar or less severity, without investments into repair. (However with meteorites of higher severity research is the only thing that can at least partially handle the problem.) Research, as far as I could tell, allowed me to minimize that damage for the meteorites with created severity. Insurance fulfilled a similar function. I found insurance particularly beneficial and made a pattern of insuring at the maximum level - that allowed me to lift the funds restriction on growth potential after a catastrophe. However increasing protection implied that the water increase was placed on hold while the level of the elevation went up - hence the pay-off for safer territory was very costly when taking into account time restrictions. As you learned more about the rules of the game you learned the interactive components - ie that research doesn't always lead to more protection, and at best only minimises the damage, that on the third level the time pressure makes it almost impossible to gather necessary amount of water on time. Also, that meteorites that seem less likely to hit at first often do indeed make contact with unanticipated consequences - ie contrary to research.Â  This made me more likely to take out insurance as the only thing I could rely on as predictable risk management tool. However, when the first meteorite did not have high severity (ie could be avoided by elevating the pod platform), or high probability (less than 3) it would make sense to ignore it and focus on development. The most unpleasant series of events happened when the meteorites would connect in rapid sequence giving you barely enough time to repair pods, and not enough time to gather water. One of the changes I would make to a game is that I would amend the ability to repair pods that were crashed while under construction - if I just started constructing the pod, it should take less time to repair it, and then it should require additional time for completion of construction. This way there is no added incentive to build just before a collision as a way to expedite the production facilities.

The main trade-off is between and the researching a meteor and the protection of the surface. We wont be able to do both together and a lot of time is consumed in this. Taking insurance is a safe method and it will cost to our total resources. I had to play the game at least 10 times to reach level 5 and during each game I experimented on each factors like first using insurance and fast advancement which landed me nowhere, but the next time when i started with a balance in protection and advancement i was able to go much higher levels by buying insurance only when i was sure research will not help or when severity was too high compared to protection . Also the channeling of resources among the pods helped to raise the protection bar because of which in most cases the damage to pods was averted. So for me the takeaway is timely decision along with a balance trade-off in research and protection against a risk help us to manage risk more effectively."192.8.190.10,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"1. In terms of the tradeoffs, the main tradeoff was in terms of maintaining the cash levels for development while at the same time having enough cash for the risk mitigation measures. There was also another level of trade off involved which was among knowledge, protection and insurance. My strategy was to invest heavily on protection and knowledge to minimize the damage caused by the impact and hence afford a lower insurance cost. The impact this strategy had on development was that there was a rush/crunch towards development pre-impact while there was always little or no damage because of the impact.2. The game drove home a clear message that risk, though of varying magnitude (strength of impact of the comet), is inevitable.  Some risks are prone to a particular area while others happen sporadically (chance of hit). But for successful growth of a community, opportunities have to be pursued in this risk-filled environment.  Risk acts as a great impediment to development but there are always measures to deal with risk both pre and post occurrence of the risk event (comet impact). These measures become even more effective when they are pooled together by a community (the island in the game) rather than an individual (pod) as it may be difficult for one individual/household to adopt measures of such high magnitude. One proactive measure of risk mitigation is to create the necessary infrastructure based on the risks that are repetitive in a particular geography â€“ one example would be using proper construction techniques/materials in higher seismic zones similar to the angle of elevation on the island. The second measure would be community/state driven investments in warning mechanisms, like the research tab in the game which can be compared to the tsunami alert systems installed across the globe. Sometimes, it is very difficult to cope up with the impact left behind by the occurrence of a risk event. But if the community can predict the frequency of the risk event, then insurance provides the best possible mitigation. One of the best examples is the rainfall insurance in countries like Ghana and India where the frequency of monsoon failure is very high. It is amidst all this risk, that opportunities for growth and development are present. The construction and up gradation of the pods on the island cannot stop because there are risks of damage being caused by a comet impact. Instead, it is important to pursue these opportunities by taking proper mitigation measures, like the ones listed earlier, and cover for the risk event. In conclusion, the game was a close replication of a real life scenario in any community and educates the importance of risk mitigation measures and community pooling of risk in order to pursue the opportunities for the great good of the society as a whole.3. One change that I would bring in to the game would be to create a cost benefit ratio for the risk event thus showing the importance of analyzing the extent to which risk will affect development and take the precautionary measures in a measured manner (neither over-invest nor under-invest in such measures)."41.205.78.95,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. The role of risk management was to get information in term of knowledge about the potential risk, developed pod to for protection, raise the level of the island to fight against potential hit from comets, carry out research to learn more on the risk reinforce protection.In doing this we took an insurance cover for damages that could occurs after a hit thereby preparing to cope with losses. Hence, Aneffective risk management strategy needs to account for both the preparationfor risk before it occurs (ex ante) and coping with the consequences of riskafter its materialization (ex post). Learning lessons from a past risk that hasactually occurred (a â€œmaterialized riskâ€ù) can certainly help design thepreparation for risk.In making choicesÂ  in term of knowledge i carry out a research to learn more on the potential comet or threat; in term of protection i builds high level pod all around the island and at the same time raising up the level of the island to withstand the eventual hit or shocks that could occurred; in term of insurance, iÂ  purchased an insurance cover that will help to refinance an damaged resulting from any hit and destruction.The preparation for risk affected development immediately in term of time, resources and planning. whereas it affected development after in term of slowing down the development process of the community due to rebuilding due to damages and losses.2.

Â It was important to correctly balance your resources between upgrading your colony, buying insurance, buying protection, and using your time to research possible threats to the colony. The obvious trade offs in the beginning was whether to upgrade the colony and having to determine possible risks and buying the appropriate insurance and protection to handle possible negative shocks. I found out that if I invested too much in insurance and protection I didn't have enough resources to invest in upgrading the colony. It seemed that investing in upgrades was what gained me the most points to reach my goal per each round so it was imperative to figure the right balance in protection, insurance, and development. I also noticed that by invested in upgrades to the colony I made more money, so the obvious benefit to investing in upgrades was making more money that would then allow me to invest more in other avenues of risk management.I played the game more than once and realized to achieve my goal level I had to invest more in colony upgrades and protection over insurance. I also realized that by doing more research on the incoming comets the severity and likelihood of in collided with my colony would lessen.Â The main thing I took from the game was an example of how utilizing risk management prior to negative shocks can quickly deplete your resources but also how investing in insurance and protection prior helps tremendously in coping from negative shocks. Although the game was a general experience and simplistic it gave me a better understanding on how risk management should be utilized and the interconnection of investment and payoff.If I were to change one aspect of the game to make it more realistic to the area in which I live would be more natural disasters, such as earthquakes. The possible threats in the game came from threats off the planet but adding additional threats, like earthquakes, drought, tornadoes, flood, would force you to better manage your assets in case of additional negative shocks.Â "24.164.172.106,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role in the game are Severity, chance to hit and do research.

I don't play video games so I felt that I was at a disadvantage of not being quick or reactive to the rapid movements of the game. Then I realized thats what risk management is. If you are placed in a situation of crisis you will not possess all the movements and decisions that are required to eliminate damage or loss. Often you are placed in a situation where you have limited knowledge, protection and insurance to compensate for risk. It is how you learn and react from your mistakes is how you will improve your chances to minimize risk moving forward. While playing the game I tried different strategies of building the pod community. One strategy was to build out the community rapidly and not consider the proper amount of insurance needed to protect the community. Another strategy was not to build out at all and that strategy didn't work out either. The problem was education and insurance and not finding balance.As I played the game, it became apparent preparation of risk is very important in trying to balance out the other components of knowledge and insurance. You need all three.The question is how - what is the best way to do it quickly and effectively? I played the game several times and what I would do differently is increase my knowledge of comets and gain information from my peers that were also playing the game. I realize that our reading assignments spoke to that. The countries that had crisis studied the outcome from similar situations in other countries to increased their education and to reduce risk. Education/knowledge was the most important component of the game that I drew from.if I was in the position of developing a new version of the game, I would have a section where players could study the history of the planet and comet activity in more detailed fashion.This information would include comet activity on a monthly/yearly basis and the damage caused Â and its value. It should also include information from other planets that have comet activity so information could be shared to reduce risk. I would also have an component where you have teams, this would be helpful in drawing strength from one another and reduce time and outcome. I wish that I could have done better playing the game but I learned a lot of the importance of risk management.Â "212.88.98.35,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of riskmanagementÂ inthe game I learnt how to plan and draw strategies that can give you someresilience because with the resources (pods and the island) available you planfor them equitably.Knowledge,here you are tasked to carry out research especially on comets look at severityand the impact that it might have on the investments on the ground in this caseprotecting, my podsÂ .

If you just picked insurance alone, all your developments got damaged after asteroids hit but you would only have to pay a small price fix them. However, If you chose to go for protection only, your developments would be raised and the asteroids would not damage your properties but the problem is that you would not be able to build developments fast enough to win the game. Preparation for risk affected development in that if you focused too much on the asteroid information, you ended up having a more reactionary approach and the problem with that is the asteroids had sometimes had a higher intensity than what the research data was indicating, so you would end up with damaged developments even though you were not expecting them. I was generally thinking the whole time during the game about going for protection as a main reducer of risk but it never worked out for me.2) The first time round I was confused about how to go about things because I did not understand what I need to prioritize as far as the elements of insurance, protection, knowledge and building settlements goes. The second time round I tried to have the settlements all in one small cluster and focused on protection and upgrading the five settlements in order to increase my chances of filling up the life meter. This strategy was not able to get me past level 2. I then chose to build as many settlements as possible and rely mainly on protection, but i still could not get through to level 3. After being utterly frustrated, I went all in with the insurance, but that only worked in level one as in the higher levels, I was not able to rebuild fast enough to fill up the life meter. I would literally fill it up, and then an asteroid hit my settlements with five seconds left on the clock. I finally went for a balanced strategy of insurance and protection and that is what finally got me though to level 3 and after a few more attempts, I was not able to go higher as every time you lost, you went all the way back to level 1.3) I loved the game because it was really challenging, and risk management in the real world is no piece of cake either. It is difficult and folks have to deal with allot of variables in order make a decision about how to help millions of people deal with natural disasters and other issues that may come up. So, in the big picture, I would not change a thing. On a micro scale meaning myself, I would not have people go all the way back to level 1 after failing at higher levels. I would prefer wrestling with the level I just lost, instead of going all the way back down."207.181.203.208,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,30.0 to 33.0,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"The role of risk management was that with a limited number of resources/money and time, you had to continue developing your pods, while also protecting against comet attacks.  Comets were observed so that you had a better knowledge/understanding of the severity/potential damage, as well as the likelihood/chance of being hit.  At the same time, you had the option to buy insurance and you were expected to continue development throughout.  By taking the time and money to prepare for risk (observing the comet, spending money to increase your severity, and purchasing insurance), pod development had to be postponed.  But then when the pods got attacked, you were able to recover much faster because of all the steps you'd taken.  So it was much easier to recover from a disaster.  To succeed at the game, you also had to balance everything, you couldn't just focus on one or two tasks exclusively.  Instead, you had to do all of them together and quickly go back and forth to manage your risk (from various angles - observing the comet, increasing severity and purchasing insurance) and increase pod development.If I were to play the game again, I would make sure that I do all of the above (pod development, observe the comet, purchase insurance, and increase severity to match).  Initially, I didn't spend enough time on comet observation, but once I did, then I got more time to recover from attacks and thus sustained less damage.  I'd also spend more time watching comets that have higher chance of hitting (i'd focus more on those).  If a comet is less dangerous (less severe and very low chance of hitting), I would observe for a bit, but then I'd focus on other tasks.  Whereas if it was high-risk (then I'd spend time observing and matching severity).If I was to make one change to the game, I'd add financial risk.  While natural disasters such as comets are risks, in today's world, particularly, the financial market is such an embedded part of the world, that it consists of a risk.  You could enable this risk by the pods not always returning a consistent stream of income, and instead sometimes they don't give you the revenues/growth you expect.  It might be too complicated to implement this in the game, but a simple addition would be to add a random multiplicative factor to the $ coming from pod development, and that factor can very between 0.5 and 1.25.  This way, you could demonstrate the financial risks that impact people's salaries and firms growth prospects."24.130.174.18,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The Risk Horizon game required that I use my best judgement to make decisions about risk management and mitigation on a fictional planet. The most salient lesson that I took away from this game is that every individual situation was different, and there was no best solution to beat the game. Instead, the player needed to make decisions based on the specifics of each level. For example, when I began playing I placed a premium on purchasing insurance immediately, so as to insure myself against damage from a comet. But I eventually realized that sometimes I would â€œget luckyâ€ù and avoid severe comet damage during a level. In this case, it was best to delay the purchase of insurance until my research revealed a severe threat. If only non-severe comets emerged, I could simply pay out of pocket to repair the damage. And if my research revealed a comet that could cause severe damage, I could always purchase a better insurance policy.Moreover, I found that prevention is a double-edged sword. The high cost of protection reduced my ability to continue developing, and frequently caused me to miss my development goals and lose a level. I found it was best to achieve a marginal level of protection against minor comet strikes, and to use insurance to protect against serious hits. This allowed me to focus on development and not worry about minor comet strikes.The most important lesson I learned from the game was the need to balance different types of risk mitigation. For example, research could sometimes show that nearby comments were non-severe and unlikely to strike. In these cases, I could sacrifice money for protection and insurance. Instead of immediately spending this money on development, I would try to save it in case I needed more protection or insurance in the next level. I found it helpful to develop at a steady pace in each level, so that I always maintained a small â€œnest eggâ€ù in case of emergencies.If I were to create a new game, first of all, I would likely include an option to abandon the planet. It doesnâ€™t make much sense to attempt to build a town in a place with such frequent catastrophes when, one assumes, there are better options elsewhere. If I were to develop a new game, I would require the player to choose one of three locations for development, each with different risks and levels of risk. At the beginning of each game, the player should choose the most hospitable location for development by evaluating the risks and benefits of each location through research.I would also include an opportunity for the player to leverage greater financial resources. I would have appreciated an opportunity to receive a loan to gain more protection or increase development in the short term, with the understanding that I would pay it off over time. Of course, this would make the game more complicated, so more time would be needed for play at each level.

It was, at times, a tricky balance knowing when to build-out the community versus research a potentially catastrophic event. One of the ways I chose to mitigate risk was by always purchasing the highest quality insurance at the start of each new level of the game. Though sometimes expensive, it allowed me to focus my time on knowledge and protection. By allocating insurance funds at the start of the level I didn't have to spend my time worrying about whether my properties would be destroyed/ critically damaged when the next comet hit because if they were I would have the funds to repair.The first few times that I played the game I didn't research the incoming comets. Once I understood how important the research portion of the game was I was able to maximize my research time based on the severity/ chance of hit.Â  I live in a flat area of the United States. The region sees many tornadoes, often occurring spontaneously, providing little time to react. Our community has installed warning sirens. When the siren sounds, everyone makes their way to the basement. This, in some ways, represents the protection bar. The largest differences here would be damage faced based on infrastructural damage versus the damage a community would face with human fatalities. Luckily, the game doesn't try and quantify these things -- providing a simpler ""percentage damaged"" statistic. This is where the game and reality heavily differ. A risk manager, in any part of the world, will have many more complex factors to consider when identifying risk management strategy's.Â  The game also allowed for infrastructural development. Though not mentioned, this may signify the development of technology, health care, education etc. A community that is developing may be able to get to a point of specialization thus, allowing for faster research, better transfer of knowledge/ protection, and a generally more streamlined ability to grow. This wasn't well represented in the game. Both, knowledge and protection, grew at the same rate from level 1 through level 6. This, of course was an oversight needed for simplicities sack but, may actually play in the favor of reality.

I played the game several times, at the first time, I bought the insurance at the very beginning of each level and only built 3 of the pods and kept developing them first. This strategy doesn't work for me since buying insurance lost money which could be used for development or building new pods. For the second time, based on the knowledge of severity of attack, I chose the protection level matched to severity and didn't buy insurance at all. Most of the time, this strategy works, however, the knowledge is not accurate enough (uncertainty) sometimes. I tried to use two different strategies, one is buy insurance, the other is increasing the level of protection and making protection higher than the predicted severity. Both of them worked in some way, From the game, it is quite obvious that if we can protect well without vigorously affecting development, we can pass the level for sure. Once the damage occurred, it is very hard to recover, especially if the damage happened in later stages. Buying insurance would help recovery, but the effect is limited. I feel like good preparation is the best way to reduce damage and for overwhelming damage, insurance is necessary. In the game, it is hard to determine when would be a best time to buy insurance. Just as in reality, insurance won't be executed for approximately half of the times. Also, I found that if I build more pods at the beginning and even though each of the pod won't develop very fast, but the overall green bar grows faster in this way(compared to less pods with higher levels) I think this may implicate that the wider-coverage protection with lower level would be more effective than partial protection with high level. If I would developing a new version of the game, I would make what factors influence the speed of green bar more clearly."193.134.242.13,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"Risk management in any form is a â€œgameâ€ù of making moreinformed decisions, and better choices. I believe this game very wellillustrated both proactive measures (insurance, preparedness, research), andreactive measures (need for information connections) that are essential tothink through and analyse complex scenarios. It was clearly visible, that somechoices have more immediate, but at the same time less efficient effects (raisingthe level of the island); while others need time to be efficient, but have longlasting effects (developing buildings). I liked the insurance option, and howit effects my decisions as well. I always opted for the basic coverage only,but at every level I felt the need to purchase insurance as soon as possible. Havingonly basic insurance coverage may not be the most rational choice, but one thatwas immediately apparent to me. The game also reflected well how riskmanagement sometimes is a complex multitasking matrix, constantly trying tofactor changes in decisions.I have played the game twice, but aligned strategy withinone game as well. My first attempt was more of an intuition game, then as wewent ahead, I developed some sort of a strategy.

(And the sudden implementation of arandom policy may be a very valid example from the country I am from.) In thisgame, I could imagine a policy that comes in effect all of a sudden, as a wayof protection for future events, but immediately is also as a â€_burdenâ€ù thatneeds to be dealth with, within a limited time frame. Another aspect ofdisasters that could be easily included is the amount of false informationpopping up after each disaster (among the green ones, some red spots could alsopop up that you should not click on.)

Â Insurance --especially the maximum packages available -- really helped to keep repair costs down, and smaller repair costs translated into less extensive repairs, and thus faster recovery. Â Also, the more advanced the stage of development, the more important Research became in mitigating repair costs, which were rising with every new level of upgrading. Â Protecting the community was expensive from an opportunity costperspective, but it was very useful to have invested in such research, becauseit also helped to drive down shock impact and Â repair costs, and made coping easier.Â  Sometimes though, even when insurance was inhand, protection applied and research efforts sustained, damage was still highperhaps to demonstrate that information can still be imperfect, and that highdamage may not necessarily indicate poor risk management. Â Ultimately I learned that risk management can be low pressure during low risk periods and high pressure as risk probability and severity rises. Â Successful risk management calls for striking a balance between choices made Â for development, upgrading, protection and resilience building activities, during low and high risk periods, all within a context of limited resources, changing information, and time sensitive development goals.

Once these two were in place, I was certain of having missed comets orincase there was a hit, I quickly made community connections which helped inreducing the damages caused by the hit.

Since every action in the game cost money, it was necessary to cutdown on any extra costs that one could avoid otherwise so I avoided buyinginsurance until I had built all pods and upgraded them- somewhere level 3.

Â Clearly, developing the community as fast aspossible was the primary purpose of the game. However, using some funds tosecure insurance or protection (or both) were the trade-offs I was confrontedwith.Â  The amount of protection andinsurance varied depending upon the situation (the severity of the comet andthe probability of the comet striking the community).Â I played the game several times tounderstand how various factors played out against one another. Initially I wasplaying it too safe and unable to score sufficient points to move to the laterstages. However after a few rounds it was clear that securing as many points aspossible, while keeping an eye on the severity and probability of impact wasthe most important thing to consider. The reason being that the more one builds out the community, the greater is theincrement in funds (every 4 second period). Â So if initially the funds are used to buildthe community, the amount of funds available towards the later part of the game(at each level) will be greater as opposed to using the funds to buy protectionor insurance and then not having sufficient gunds to build out the community. Attempting to build protection -greater than or equal to cometâ€™s severity, wasbetter than buying insurance. However, if towards the END of the round (whencommunity is most developed) a highly severe (8 through 10) comet appeared andone had sufficient funds but not sufficient time to get protection it madesense to use funds to buy insurance rather than risking a big loss.Also, getting protection early was the keysince protection carries over from one level to another but the insurance has to be purchased in everylevel, and sometimes twice in the same level in certain situations. For example, if there is a high likelihood of severe damage and there are insufficient funds to purchase the best (75%) insurance, it may be prudent to purchase 50% or even 25% insurance. However, if the situation repeats itself, later while one is at the same level but has funds to purchase the max. (75%) insurance, then one has to pay the full amount again.Â The one twist to the game I would like to addis the trade-off between re-building DAMAGED (perhaps insured) community vs. investingin protection at the cost of slower community build out. The reason is thatthere are three stages of tracking a comet. If a highly severe comet likely tohit the community is detected early enough, protective measures can be taken.Should there be a lack of time, the insurance can be purchased. However, ifsuch a comet is detected later in its path, only insurance can be used tominimize the loss. Rather than having it as a random event, there should besome option for the player to look at trade-offs between buying insurance andsecuring protection â€“ depending where in its path the comet is."123.231.73.27,0.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"It needs to take decisions strategically so as to strike abalance between achieving the prosperity by way of attaining the development Â while you have effective risk management inplace.

Â Â The goal is to try and balance between all of Â actions in real time in order to master the game.Â At the begining we have some money(1000) we can spend on pots, insurance Â and protection. At the start i decided i will build as many pots as possible and save many to pay for an insurance. I decided to build 3 pots and buy a most expensive insurance that cover 75% damage. I took this step to take the most expensive insurance because i wasnt sure how big damages might be and how offen there are collisions. With the rest of the money i decided to level up terrain.When the pots were build and i level-up terrain i was watching the comets. When the risk of crash was high i was getting as much knowledge as possible. when the risk was low i was level-up my protection.After any of pots was finished i was upgrading it to be able to get to next level.In short words my tactic was: build a pot, buy insurance, watch comet while pots were being builid. If comet was not on collision course i was levelig up my terrain.Â And when any of pot was done and i had money i was upgraidng it. this tactis gave me a level 6.Â Buing insurance gave a result in a long term, observing comets(geting knowledge ) gave a result in a short time.I played game many times, i was trying ot find best tactic. I would reccomend buing insurance (at least 50%) and with the rest of the money build as many pots as possible. then upgrade them. When its being upgraded try to look on comets and decide which may be on a collision course. if there is no , try to level up terrain if there is a high risk to crash try to get as much knowledge as posiible.If i could add one thing that would be a another different risk (like a earth quake).

When one hears the theoretical part of Risk Management may well develop the impression and idea that at least in personal level this can be achieved easily as we tend to have or -think- that we have, more control over our selves, especially in regarding the risks we take willingly. Yet, post to my experience with Risk Horizon I have changed my mind. I was lucky enough to be born in a country where natural disasters are extremely rage phenomenon and for the bulk part of my life the public sector financial crisis was an ""unknown"" word for me and for my fellow citizens. As a result, when the crisis began affecting the state which I used to live, things changed unexpectedly. Most did not know how to cope with the new facts, or at least not before enough data was collected on how to deal with something never experienced before. On the other hand, for others opportunities arised amidst the crisis, for some as a result of preparation and for others by random chance.Â  Â  Â  Â Risk Horizon offers the player the opportunity to invest in an environment which as in reality, poses dangers. Thus, the player willingly (or because he/she has to for survival reasons) takes risks in order to maximize as possible his/her profits. In addition, the player is given tools which aim at enhancing his/hers chances of achieving his/her goals with the minimum input. In the beginning, one focuses on the main danger, the natural disaster which is caused by the impact of the comet. Yet, soon I realized that the comets are only one aspect of the problem. I had to deal as well with time and demand, or at least, this is how I interpreted the problem. Therefore, with time pressure, increasing demand of resources and the danger of going backwards in case of damage in the production line, I struggled six times to reach level 10. I only went halfway experimenting with different combinations of time allocation and resources. Nevertheless, I collected valuable experience. Any investment without first examining most of the risks with which one may confront with is a bad investment. Collecting a variety of data regarding the social, financial, political and climate/geologic aspects of the state or region one invests to is essential. Post to the recognition of the possible risks and threats and the probabilities for those to occur, one has to prepare for the dangers he/she recognized using the available technology to minimize the damage and purchasing an insurance in order to protect his/her assets in case of unavoidable natural or systemic disaster. Â Â  Â Finally, if I could add/change something in the concept of the game, that would be the human factor. That of course would require the whole game it self change. From a game to a simulator. But the idea of recognizing and coping with systemic risks really intrigues me. Thank you for your timeHope you enjoy the MOOC as much as I do.P.S.

It has the responsibilities .Knowledge is basic,cause some risks happens we can predicted but but we cant stop it to happen.That's why i found the protection and insurance is so esstential in the whole progress. If natural disaster happens ,the best things we can do is the reduce the damage to the lease level. To react fast is also an Â important lesson i learn from the game.No matter what happened ,and how bad is it,we dont have time just check and sorrow,react is the first solution.I kept playing this game until i lost in in the third round,I kind of enjoy playing it.To keep playing it is just like join the knowledge we learned from the course into practice,like we r in the contral of this system and we have responsibility to keep it safe and goes well.If you stop on half way,it's gonna be quite hard to continue the thinking, thinking is very useful in playing this game,we put ourselves into that role and play it with that role, to think not just an individual but someone hold the responsibility and we should think whole .check each step and make sure things go well.The insurance coverage,the community coorperation ,how to maintain the pods ,to raise the level of the pods ,check the risks from outside ,the growing level.AN interesting is that i am learning strategy management at the same time,to combine these two together and put it into practice is interesting.Insurance is the most important part i learned ,,In the game ,I would rather buy the most expence one cause i can cover more ,i am sure i wouldnt do that before in real life ,but now i ;ve changed my mind.ONly when risks happens you know how important insurance is and would rathere devoted more into it.I Â think this works not for a country or groups also for individuals. it's remind me and i should consider my owe insurance not just for now and for the future.The community,the community would help a lot when risk happens ,they r much near ,like neighbors. when risks occurs and you need very urgent help ,to find someone near by is very important. Â the communities provided the chances of this.When risks occurs ,especially natural disaster, time is life, Â to rescue people you need react as fast as you can ,the communities near by offered their help and would save much more lives at that time.To Â keep the information sharing,and have certain meeting with the communities is a good way ,you can keep in touch and keep the update ,if some unpredictable happened, may be the communities or your neighbour notice early than you.If there ;s a new vision of the game, i think to connect people who play it gonna be better,like communities.They can sharing information while playing it and keep the update of the going,or if there are group playing,like two or three students can play it together ,it help the team work and coorperation in risk management process.this may need the game more complicated ,you have to management the risk in the game and at the same time ,to discuss and team work with others ,may be your classmate , to make decisions ,to aware each others resonsibility and the whole process of discussion .This is more interesting and we can learn from each other.Cause people play it with diffrent background"212.44.26.228,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices didyou make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge,protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affectdevelopment (immediately, or after some time)?The aspects of risk management that werehighlighted in this game included choices about the rate of development in theface of risk that are only known at a probabilistic level. This means that youhad to choose how many pods to build based on the probability of a meteor hit.You could choose to develop faster, but that risked greater destruction if theimpact was severe. There is a tradeoff between speed of development the levelof damage expected. As you have limited funds, you also have tochoose how to allocated them in terms of spending money on insurance,essentially the risk mitigation part of risk management, money spend ondevelopment (building more pods) which allows your community to grow faster,become more profitable and be more robust against shocks, and on research whichis aÂ  way of gaining knowledge about thepossible risks, and this allows you to plan more accurately. An example wouldbe that, if, through research, you learned that a meteor had a low chance of ahit, you could choose to develop faster rather than spend money on insurance.If, however, you research showed you that a hit was likely to happen and waslikely to cause a large amount of damage, it made more sense to buy lots ofinsurance and slow development to minimize the damage.Ifyou played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were toplay it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what didyou do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learnedfrom the game?I played the game twice, and I learnt thatresearch was very important in accurately assessing the threat from themeteors, and that insurance was very valuable in getting the community up andrunning again after a hit had (inevitably) happened. I also learnt that it paidto be a little bit cautious in building new pods if you knew a meteor hit waslikely to happen. The first time I played the game, I built too many podsinitially and then took heavy losses with the first severe meteor hit.Thegame captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagineyou are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you tochange or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to betterrepresent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I think I would give the game a longertimescale. I think many of the risks that the place I live faces (Britain) arelong term risks e.g. increases in severe weather like flooding or drought,driven by even more long term effects like climate change. It would beinteresting to have a different selection of risks that included chronic riskslike an ageing population or disease rather than just acute risks like themeteor strike. "146.232.117.93,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management plays a fundamental role in the game. Risk management played the role of helping to minimize detrimental occurrences and events that pose a threat to your developmental objectives. Risk management is multi-faceted and requires special analysis of the main objectives of the operation. In the game, risk management assisted with ensuring that progress is soundly and safely made with main objectives still being safely pursued. Â In the game the first thing that you need to consider isdevelopment. This is in fact the primary objective of the game. In real-lifeterms, development represents what an organization is primarily specialized in.This development is also significant in that in the game it increases the rateat which your energy levels grow. Therefore, it is important that developmentis prioritized as it is the life-blood of your survival. At the same time, thisdevelopment needs to be protected, as meteors constantly approach your area andpose as a risk threat. It is therefore important that you are constantlyupgrading your developments as this increases the protection of your gains. Since the meteors pose a threat, it is important to haveenough information on the meteors in order to reduce the effects of theirimpact. In order to successfully do this, you need to ensure that informationis gathered early and as much of it is collected in order to effectively dealwith the risk of impact. Also , it is imperative that ALL meteor threats areanalysed, even if the probability is small. This is where knowledge plays animportant role in risk management. Knowing ALL information about the threatsyou face puts you in a better position to deal with those threats.Risk transfer in the form of insurance, also plays acritical role in reducing the effects of risk.Â Although an insured can use insurance as a mitigating factor in order toreduce the actual loss should a risk event occur, the actual risk can never be transferred.Â  As such the risk remains the exposure to theinsured.Many significant choices and trade-offs were made in termsof knowledge, protection and insurance. With knowledge, the meteors wereanalysed based on their probability of impact as well as their severity. Thehigher the probability of impact, the more research required to reduce theimpact of a meteor hit. Also if the severity of the impact is high, then it iscritical to protect the development and insure immediately.After the first few times of playing, I realised thatinsurance is critical. I insured immediately and I ensured that the insuranceis adequate. The more advanced the game stages were, the more the insurancewas, as the effect of a meteor hit became more devastating. Also I realized theimportance of information, in that the effects of meteor hits were greatlyreduced by the amount of research done on the meteors.Â  The main things learned during the gameincluded, analysing all potential risks posed and ensure that you are protectedat all times from impeding threats. I also learned that risk is impossible tocompletely avert at all times, hence one needs a strategy to minimize itsdevastating impact, rather than try to completely eliminate it. I would perhaps add the element of people or staff. I wouldtry and demonstrate that people also play a role in risk management. I wouldhave a staff consisting of builders and administrators to oversee developments.This angle is critical as it demonstrates the role of people risk in riskmanagement and how an poorly managed staff can pose a risk to yourorganization.Â "124.6.181.204,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The game was about the importance of Risk Management in the development of Alora. The community is exposed to potential socks (comets that might hit the water and cause waves) that would suppress development. Just as in the real world, each nation should inevitably confront potential shocks (idiosyncratic or systemic).The role of Risk Management is clearly seen in the game. A balance should be determined between developing the community and preparing for the potential shocks, given a specific set of tools (research, protection, and insurance) and resources. This balance would mean that to obtain one, another should be forgone. I was made to choose whether to utilize all my resources in building/ upgrading pods, spend time on research to acquire knowledge, invest on protection, or invest in insurance. I chose to develop the community progressively, building up a few pods from the start, sacrificing income and investing on protection/ insurance (if the situation permits) at the same time.Preparation for risk affect development immediately during the start of the game. This helped cushion the potential shock caused by the comets. However, during the succeeding levels, I just need to augment my protection with insurance to absorb the damages caused by the comets.2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I made several tries of the game, hoping to beat Level 4 and reach Level 5. I got the hang of it and I did reach the latter. Of course, this entailed changes in strategy in order to move to the higher level. The following is a summary of my choice of strategy: At the start of the game, during the establishment of the community, instead of using all my resources to erect pods and fill all the spaces quickly, I chose to limit my structures (the trade-off would be the fast income generation due to a great number of pods at the start), progressively upgrading them one by one and successively filling the spaces; constantly keeping in mind to increase my protection, research, and buy insurance if the situation permits. This was no easy task since choosing one would mean foregoing an alternative that could bring about an increase in development/ milestones.I learned that while the desire for improvement is strong, the changes needed to bring improvement can entail substantial risk. However, the reluctance to take risk would be more costly in the end. Risk management can help manage the potential downside from taking risk.Â 3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Personally, instead of comets, I would propose typhoons affecting the agricultural lands and flooding coastal towns in the Philippines.Â "139.190.154.217,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"A risk is an event or condition that if it occurs,it will have positive or negative effects onproject objectives. Risk has two components which were uncertainty and exposure. It is uncertain because it represents future events. It has possibility of occurring greater than 0% and less than 100%. Risk is something that is present in doing any kind of work. Possibility or probability of some kind without which the work could not be fulfilled. Risk is involved in every planned activity whether it is seen or unseen.Risk management is a continuous procedure which should have to be present in every organization in the process of their developments. In this piece of work we look at the definition of risk and its management through which it can be treated well. Disaster is a hard acceptable truth but it could be stopped or chances of its occurrence could be minimize by proper risk management strategies implemented in the place. We look at the case study of BP oil spill disaster why it was happened and what were its catastrophic results and how it could be stopped in future.Risk is driven through two types of factors involved in any organization which were internal factors and external factors. There also four types financial risk, strategic risk, operational risk and hazard risks.Internal factors contributing to financial risk in any organization were liquidity and cash flow while external factors conclude interest rates, foreign exchange and credit risk.Internal factors contributing to strategic risk were organizations research and development strategies whereas external factors were competition, customer changes, industry changes and customer demands. Internal factors contributing to operational risks were accounting controls, information system, recruitment and supply chain. While external factors were regulation, board composition and culture.Risk handlingReduceAcceptAvoidTransferRisk analysisConsequencesoptionsdecision makingRisk AssessmentQuantifyQualifyPrioritiseRisk StrategyPurposeApproachTaskToolsRisk AssessmentRisk assessment is a process in which risk has been categorized into different parts. It is a careful examination of what could harm in the work place and people around. It also qualifies the measures those should be put in place for reducing the harms. It is the responsibility of every organization that its workers have been protected by the harms caused by its operations. In oil drilling companies those measures should be highly priorities as because of the nature of activity. The risk was major upon the environment and the consequences of the operations mainly lead to big disaster as well as impacted upon the people. Risk assessment is mainly connected to.Once the hazards identified then the later part is to decide what to do with them. Law requires to do everything â€œreasonable practicableâ€ù to protect people from harm. Controlling measures should be in place firstly, so as to avoid the hazard to an extent. Such as trying less risky option, preventing access to hazardous site, organize work to reduce exposure to hazard, issue personal protective equipments, proving welfare facilities.Operational threats: those were caused by disruption in supplies and operations, loss of access to essential assets, failures in distribution of products or materials etc.Reputational threats: these could be arising because of any big failure which results in disaster.Financial threats: Financial risks are risk which comes from business failure, stock market, interest rates, and unemployment.Technical threats: those were related to the technical difficulty comes in the process because of default in technology by any failure. The new advent of technology is also responsible or taken as threat.My game code is E258QGt"189.187.50.138,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The firsttime I played the game I could not get past level 1. After re-reading theinstructions, I played four more times, with much better results. I managed toget to level five twice and to level six also on two occasions. In thefirst times I played, I invested a lot in insurance. Then I realized that abetter strategy is to invest more in development, research and protection, especiallyduring the early stages of the game. Insurance is useful at levels 5 and 6,when a larger number of comets appear with higher impact and probability levels.This aspect can be directly related to everyday life, where it is essential tofocus on obtaining accurate information about the potential risks and takeaction to mitigate them, evaluating the decision to purchase insurance inspecific circumstances. With regardto the research activity, I find many similarities with the real world.Although research in the game is related to collect information about potentialrisks, I find an interesting relationship with the benefits of carrying outscientific and technological research in communities: the results of the researchactivities are not immediate, and even some research activities will not giveany concrete results (such as the cases where extensive research is done on acomet that doesnâ€™t hit). However, sustained research activities produce resultsthat translate into significant benefits for the community. Anotherinteresting aspect is related to development. I realized that it is importantto invest in development as soon as possible because these activities sustain thegameâ€™s main indicator. The development demand will increase as the game progresses,so it's important to achieve a robust development level before reaching levels5 and 6. Overall, Ithink the game reflects the dynamics that actually take place with respect torisk management. I think it is an interesting exercise that can be related atdifferent levels: from the individual, group, organizational, to the regionalor national perspective. I think thegame is a good way to experiment with the balance between research, preventionand insurance. One of the changes that I would integrate to the game would beto define different types of activities that could be performed by the""pods"", that is, that the user could select the functions to beperformed by different pods (for example if a pod will be a school, aproductive enterprise, a research center, etc.). That would pose interesting questionsregarding development, as for example: what would happen if there are threeschools, three productive enterprises and no health services? Or what wouldhappen if there are four big productive enterprises but only oneunder-developed school?"84.124.17.244,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Essay on Risk Horizon game1. Regarding the first partof the essay, the role of risk management in the game has been revealed as a key task to promote the fate of individuals and families in the virtual world of Alora. In this regard, it has been shown that planning and preparing to address the risksis effective to recover from losses and to increasebenefits, so it has been demonstrated that the fate of communities can be improved if the risksare adequately managed . Specifically,the game required to test our risk management in theareas of knowledge, protection and insurance. On knowledge, the game required to understand the changes that happenedwhen a meteorite impacted the world of Alora andcaused flooding. Regarding the knowledge, the game required to understand the perturbations caused by meteorites, aswell as internal and external conditions, and possible outcomes on housing and facilities in order to reduce uncertainty. As for protection, it was necessary to reduce the probability andmagnitude of losses in housing and facilities, and also to learnto increase economic benefits to maintain growth and tackle the material losses caused by meteorites and floods.Regarding insurance, the game has demonstrated the usefulness ofthis financial resource to recover fromlosses and to obtaingreater advantage of Â benefits. It hasdemonstrated the desirability ofinsurance, helping to overcome losses,to maintain purchasing power and also to keep pace with growth. For these reasons, the game has allowedme to learn that preparing forthe risk definitely affects development, because if individualsand communities do not acquire knowledge of the risks, they are not protectedand are not insured, it will be much harder for them to recover from disaster, to rebuild their lives and to keeping a positive development.2. Regarding the secondquestion, I have played the game morethan once and I can say I've changed mygame from the first time. In that sense, the first few times I tried toaccumulate knowledge to understand howthe game worked and to decide which were the best choices to ensure the welfare of households and to achieveadequate profit. Thus, in the first games I tried to understand how the various risk management components interacted.As I was playing, I was understanding how the game worked and I was learning thatgood risk management requireproper preparation, that is, knowledge,protection and be insurance. With this, the main thing I have learned in the game has been that risk management pretends reducing losses and increasing profits when confrontingand taking risks. So, risk management shouldtry to get minimum possible losses after a flood and, for this,the best option is to have adequate risk insurance. Moreover, thereduction of losses can increase profits because it has more resources to devote to the benefit and development of individuals and the community. 3. Finally, with regard to the third question, in the event that the game developers set up a new version of the game, Iwould introduced a set of custom risks, according to thecountry of residence of the student. For example, according to the World Development Report 2014, in East Asia and in South America I would include the risk from natural disasters, while in other regions I would include, among others, the risk against large recessions, maternal mortality or homicides.Â "187.4.187.160,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Â The main idea behind the game is the use, unknown by the player, of concepts of risk management. During the game, you have to invest in knowledge, protection and insurance, and still save wealth to develop your civilization. If you invested too much time in protection, your civilization would not grow and be richer. If you invested only in development and new construction, you would lack in protection and would be more fragile to shocks (asteroids in the game). If you invested only in knowledge, you would spend all your time observing and not acting. And, at the end, if you do not invested in insurance, anytime your planet could be affected by a shock stronger than your defenses could handle, and you would spend a lot of money fixing things up.Â  Â  Â  Â  Knowing this, it is easy to observe that the optimal configuration will be a combination of all the things said till now. During the game, you have to balance between these options of investments to be strong against shocks, and still be able to develop and catch your goals.Â  Â  Â  Â  At a first glance, you could say that investing in protection is a bad idea, watching that your civilization will be stucked, but playing a few times, you would see the importance of this investment when facing an inevitable shock. The same thing for insurance, when you think that it is a lot of resource going on a thing that will protect you in a possible case of damage, while you 'should' be using this money in infrastructure to grow.Â  Â  Â  Â Still, should be highlighted the importance of conections and acess to knowledge of other people. Sometimes, you are having a problem that happened before and some people handled well that time. In the game, we can see this in the case where the more you observe and obtain knowledge about the risk, more time you have to get informations in other communities and prepare yourself for the incoming shock.Â  Â  Â  Â The game is a simplified version of playing with risk management, but would be nice if it had more options of risks, and more ways to prepare yourself for then. With this, could be added a 'memory', a 'know how' about the problem you just confronted. This would simulate the real life better, because today in the world, we can observe that when a shock affects a country, the next time that the same shock occurs, the country is better prepared for it, and it has way less impact in the country, reducing the damage caused, like live losts.."220.227.245.12,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1) The role of risk management in the game was saving the projects and maximising the wealth and saving life.The knowledge has a direct relation to the time we had at the time of disaster.

The choices I made at the beginning of the game to 1. buy insurance  and 2. build protection, based on the severity of  the incoming threat. This trade off meant that I was not able  to build the community at a faster rate to generate wealth. I found that there was a diminishing rate of return from protection, particularly when the threat was severe. I also learnt that the severity of risk did not always equate to the size of the damage. While playing in Level three, I found that it was very difficult to generate wealth in the community.  While investing large sums in the community, the rate of return on investment was slow. I played the game numerous times to try out different strategies. I tried just buying insurance and building a community as quickly as possible. Sometimes this worked, other times it didn't as it didn't generate significant wealth. I tried buying protection and building a community only. This was the least successful strategy as the cost of repairs was prohibitive. I found the combination of buying some insurance, some protection, and building the community with the available resources to be the most successful strategy.The main thing I learnt from the game was to assess risk as soon possible to monitor its severity as it crossed the screen, and try to prepare for it with the resources available I also learnt that there was a limit to the amount of protection that could be purchased that offset some of the effects of the damage caused by the comets. I live in an earthquake-prone part of my country. I would tweak the game by omitting the comets and introducing earthquakes. The aim of the game would be to build a rise high rise building, built to withstand a 7.7 earthquake on the Richter Scale through six rounds of the game. Each round of the game would involve building three levels. Resources available would include cash for property development - complying with current regulations and building standards, property insurance, and property protection in the form of  purchasing base isolators,  allowing the building to sway in an earthquake. The rate of return upon Investment into the building would increase expediently. Earthquakes will roll underground  across the screen, at various depths and severity, monitored by a seismic recorder, which will let you know the severity of the quake.  The timeline for building each floor, and the amount of money available will be similar to the comet game. The one thing I would include in the game is an evacuation strategy to be included in the build. As earthquakes occur at any time, such a  strategy is essential. The winner has built a safe and secure six-storied building, that will withstand a 7.7 earthquake on the Richter Scale."81.110.184.169,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-63.0 to -36.0,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-12.0 to -5.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"1What was the role of risk management in the game?

By gaining knowledge aboutthe coming comets I have to decide on the right amount of protection in form ofraising the civilization higher. In case of unavoidable risk I could buyinsurance to share the cost of rebuilding the civilization after the hit.Preparation affected the development immediately, I could not build as fast,but the costs will be visible only if you compare the avoided losses with thecost of raising the island.2If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if youwere to play it again?

In this game, the risk management was reflected in terms of raising the protection and recovering the damage once the comet is hitting the planet. In addition, there's option to purchase the insurance to decrease the damage once the planet is hit. Also, doing more research can help you predict the severity of the hit and chance of hit more precisely and in that way can help you protect your pods in a better way.The choice I make is to create multiple pods, and upgrade them when the capital is enough. Also, the trade-off will be spending the time doing the research and developing the pod. And the insurance will cost term amount of capital, and it's also a trade off.Preparation for the risk can to some degree increase the recovery once the comet has hit the planet.2. I played multiple times, and the difference was to change the sequence of doing the development of pod and doing the research. I think, the strategy is very important during the game.3.

However, when damage occurred, recovering was very costly. Thus Iunderstood that insurance was a necessity. I alwayschecked the meteors. According to the severity level of the comets, I focusedon research; the more the level of severity, the longer the research duration. Thedecision on buying an insurance depended on the number of the highly severecomets. If I saw more than one at the same time, I bought insurance. However, Icould not figure out which insurance option to buy according to the severity ofthe comets. I playedthe game more than once and what I did different than the first one was that agreat effort for a head start. I invested more to growth and upgrades togetherwith the protection. I tried to make upgrades towards to end of each round inorder to save time. What Ilearned was that if we can see the risk and the risk is inevitable, buyinginsurance is the best way to cover the damage. Â However, in order to reach optimum benefit, weneed to observe the risk carefully that we could interpret if the risk resultsin damage or not. Thus, we can save money while we are protecting ourselves. To sum up,even in a simple game it is really hard to manage all the possibilities to leada ""no damage"" result. Thus, planning and foreseeing the risk is veryimportant. The damage can be too hazardous to recover from and hence can leadto ultimate loss. We need to protect ourselves from the risk. We need toobserve the risk and we need to prepare for the risk. The cooperation in orderto cure the damage, helping each other after the damage is also essential forreducing the cost of the damage. Insurance in the game was expensive actuallyhowever when it is compared with the cost of damage, Insurance was the best wayto cover repair costs.

I learned that research is essential to reach the nextlevel, and the insurance is best purchased from the knowledge of the moreimmediate risk of potential disasters. Prepare for the risk decreased thechances of learning from mistakes, which can be very costly, so the advantagesof cost-effective Risk Management.After learning I could prepare myself to do what was most effective at each level. On the third level we need to be more aware of the risk of natural disaster, as the imminence of the threat is directly related to the time and disaster recovery. It is important to know the importance of measures at all times, if a more expensive insurance is more important than investing in development at any given time. Find a balance.2) What diddifferent was more accurate way of measuring what was needed to do first toreach the next level. And know how to wait for the right moment to make adecision. Decisions improve with errors, although not the best option in a realsituation.I used better the time to think what to do, because in a situation of risk we tend to feel threatened and make decisions irrationally, which means we learn to better control our emotions to counter a threat. Insecurity and uncertainty are major threats to risk management. In the game you can clearly see the importance of risk management as a tool to prevent, and the importance of prevention. We should warn us, not for us to pay with lives.3) Other people. As seen in the 2008 crisis, corruption and mismanagement and embezzlement show us that human factors are critical even when we talk about natural hazards, as all measures for risk management, people are involved in these situations and many fraudulent opportunities are open. This is precisely because in a situation of risk people are more vulnerable and others can take advantage of this fake opportunity to explore others.So it would be interesting to have a game where there is interaction with other people, where the decisions of others influence our decisions and also the development of our city."72.43.138.42,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was to combine knowledge (comet research), protection (insurance), externals (community development) to achieve prosperity and make coping with shocks possible.

Knowledge is a powerful source, but without protection, it is not worth a lot. Same the other way around, you can protect all you want but without proper knowledge, it is not worth as much if you would combine them. Insurance appeared to be the one with the least impact. Interesting that you cannot build protection while gaining knowledge, which is possible in the real world.Â During the game (I played it several times) I changed my strategy. The first time I started to invest lots of money only in protection. Even to a level of protection which was insane. I wanted the highest level of protection. But then I found out that without knowledge, the city is still damaged a lot. So then I knew I needed to change my strategy. The second time I first invested in a fair amount of protection, as a quick fix and immediate relief, and then focus more on the knowledge part, the long term solution. During the time I followed a comet, I made sure the houses were upgraded if there was money available. Then it is a challenge to keep those balanced: sometimes focus on the knowledge, sometimes on protection and sometimes on building more resilient houses. This helped me to complete level 4. However, I did not reach level 5 with this strategy, so maybe there is a better way. Anyway, the game shows perfectly you need to combine the different risk management factors.For me the most important thing missing is the incentive-factor. I think it plays a big role in if and where to spend money on/invest money in. The government certainly doesn't always care that much, because it does not affect them personally. Especially in countries where there is a huge gap between the poor and rich, the ones that live with great risks and the ones that make the decisions for everyone else. This point will however be impossible to integrate into the game without making it too complex.Personally I found it weird that knowledge does not cost any money in the game (right?). Were I live, research costs lots of money. This is one of the reasons why not everyone wants to invest in knowledge. You need to invest the money in something you don't know exactly how big the benefit will be. Protection is more hands on, quick fix, but will not suffice in the end. So one thing I would change is that research also costs money. Then you have a real challenge: focus on the long term while a city is potentially in danger, or focus on the short term and trying to minimize damage for the rest of time.Â "190.156.188.153,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Good night , my name is Vanessa Beltran, Iâ€™am Colombian, I apologize if my English is not drafting in technical enough.

Preparation for risks slows down development, but on the other hand if the meteor hits the community and damages happen, they slow down as well. The main things I learned from the game are: important to invest in development of the society, however not on the cost of risk-preparedness. Insurance in the game plays a big role, which I'm not sure is the case in real life. I played the game four times, on the fourth time I tried to invest in fewer number of settlements but instead develop them as fast as possible. I also learned that if the level of preparedness is too high in comparison to the level of risk of the meteors, the investment is wasted.

Previous to playing I thought I was able to make safe, rational decisions which would benefit in the long term. However, despite being a very cautious person and being fully informed on the future risks posed by the meteorites I still failed to adequately protect my city from and prepare them for risks.My first few games ended quickly with my buildings being destroyed through a lack planning and running out of funds because I had not insured them against these risks. Nevertheless on my third attempt I provided my buildings with greater levels of insurance which both reduced the levels of damage and lowered the costs of recovery. I also started to better appreciate how researching and being informed on the risks- meteorites- allowed me the benefit of 'lifting' the ground when necessary thus further reducing damage.The main challenges I faced when trying to apply successful risk management were budgeting and multi-tasking. Firstly, when taking into consideration the limited funds it was difficult to strike the right balance between building structures and preparing them for and from future shocks. The difficult decisions and forced compromises provided really strong examples of the issues faced by governments, communities and individuals when considering risk management. Secondly, the game also successfully illustrated the difficult balance of considering conflicting priorities. For example the development of the buildings and community whilst also ensuring it was adequately protected against and prepared for risks. If I were to play the game again I would firstly plan ahead before starting, take out at least a mid-level insurance and gradually build my community. Given my previous experiences I now appreciate the importance of research and therefore would assess each meteorite, establishing when one poses a risk and consequently 'lifting' the community when necessary to minimise damage thus reducing the cost of recovery. This reflects the importance of communities or governments both being aware of potential risks but also acting accordingly and taking on required protective actions and insurance. Through these precautions one can achieve long term security against risks.In conclusion, I felt the game highlighted the issues associated with risk management, most notably remembering the long term whilst seeing the immediate growth. Also I gained a greater appreciation of the benefits of preparing through risk management became really apparent, understanding and recognising risks and the benefit of insurance.

So the role of risk management is clearly covered through making the player confront risks of both hitting the village and bankruptcy.the most important choices are when several risks appear in space. In such cases I primary rely on research measure to build a base knowledge about the most influential risk and the most urgent one to provide the appropriate protection so I canÂ reduce the losses and increase the benefit.The more research I have, the more time I will have to make community connections before a shock hits, so the more protection I can gather.However, I preferred preparing for risk by protection more than depending on insurance in order to use money in invest the limited time by build more pods as long as I have enough protection which allows the village to face dangerous risks. But I used the insurance in case there was not enough time to prepare, and also to beÂ quicker and cheaper to rebuildÂ my pods when the comets damage.Fortunately we have enough resources to cover costs of preparation in contrast of some developing countriesActually, I played this game many times,First I don't know how to win or what the point of this game, but after many time playing I realized that IÂ need to build and upgrade my pods.These help my meter fill faster, andÂ reach my goal in time.Â I can build many pods at once as long as I have the resources for it.The goal is to try and balance between all of these actions in real time in order to master the game.And I know that research by having a comet selected and the telescope window openÂ is another way I can prepare for incoming shocks if the protection slider begins to cost too much money. The more time I spend with the comet selected, the moreÂ research I will collect. but this takes away time I could spend doing other actions. Its all about balancing.Also, when I purchase an insurance plan, I am protected for the rest for the round. Damaged growers will be cheaper depending on the plan I buy. Each round the plan's will increase in cost, reflecting the amount of development I have done.so the point of this game is,Â you must keep in mind when you areÂ attemptingÂ to balance preparing for comets and reaching your goal before time runs out.If my task is to developing a new version of the game, I will create something to represent the internal condition of the place that I live, not only focus on the external environment, so I can prepare more for the risk, also I will create a modern technology of building in very low cost, this idea simulates theÂ opportunities that may able to gain."75.185.77.52,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"I only managed to progress past levelone once in the first hour of play, though I had thought that I hadunderstood the tutorial; and I never managed to get passed level 4. While I discovered new techniqueseach time through, I was not able to find the right balance betweenresearch on the meteors, protection (by means of lifting thecommunity away from the waves) and development (which seems to have arelationship with building the pods, but that relationship is notexactly direct). I also could not figure out if I should be focusingon number of pods, or the extent to which they were upgraded. Towardthe end, I was focusing on smaller numbers of further upgraded pods,and I'm really not certain that I was getting anywhere with thatstrategy.I noticed that preparation for risktook a very long time, cost money, and held the development meterrelatively flat.

Without insurance, the cost of repairing thedamage to the pods was extremely prohibitive. Even when I simply choseto purchase insurance at a slightly lower level, the cost of repairswere so much more difficult to keep up with.I found that the rate at which themeteors hit seemed unrealistic. That said, it is possible thatit was proportional to the sped up rate of building and upgrading thepods. In relation to the speed of protection progress, however, themeteors seemed to come at a very high frequency. Though, this did change if I reloaded the page.If I were to play again, I think that Iwould focusing on building a larger number of pods, rather thantrying to upgrade them extensively. I think, also, that I woulddedicate more time to increasing protection of the pods. I certainlywould not, even make the mistake of not buying the top level ofinsurance.If I were to create my own version ofthis game, I think I would create something that was a bit â€œcloserto home.â€ù While the space pods were intriguing, I would would basethe town on a community on earth, so that the results of the playersactions would translate more easily to real life situations. Also, Ithink that I would make it such that the player could engage inmultiple tasks at once. In a real society, it is possible to worksimultaneously on protection measures, research and building. I mightalso have research cost money, as I don't think I remember it havingan associated cost in this game.Overall, I would say that I enjoyed thegame, and found it to be quite educational. I would certainly bewilling to play a more expanded version of the game (that would allowthe player to make more specific choices as to which protectionmeasures to take, how much of the budget to invest in each area:building, research and protection, etc), if such a version were to bereleased. I have enjoyed games such as the Half the Sky Facebookgame, and Plan It Green in the past. I really do see the value andpotential of this type of game in its ability to familiarize a wideaudience, including young people, with risk management concepts. I amexcited to see what may come of this idea!"91.144.20.78,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to

upgrade each  every built pod at least once within the level.Â  This is not possible if one overspends upon defence measures, but if a comet strikes and the player is uninsured, the collective damage will impede development and prohibit progression.Something that is crucial to eventually complete the final level is to, at the very start of the game, focus on upgrading a small number of pods from Level 1 to Level 2, before filling up all of the empty plots with individual pods.Â  In game terms, this might seem obvious as it costs less to upgrade from the base level than it does to build a new pod from nothing.Â  But I think this neatly reflects the significance of a 'perfectionist' strategy versus an 'expansionist' strategy in development  risk management.Each defence strategy comes with its own distinct risk attached.Â  Research is a preparedness strategy, not a preventative one, and also represents the risk of human fallibility- maximum research may still yield incorrect findings.Â  Insurance comes at a high cost, despite the fact that it may never be used.Â  Physical defence measures, as represented by the raising of the land, are a great drain upon finances, and a balance must be struck to prepare a suitable minimum level of protection, which the player may improve upon by later establishing 'community connections'.An insurance policy should not be taken out until about midway through the game, at which point the level of development that one has attained effects several factors that make insurance worthwhile.Â  Firstly, the increased burden of damaged incured by pods of Level 3 or above, if not offset by a progressively higher insurance plan, will obliterate any hope of reaching the targets in standard of development.Â  Secondly, highly developed pods will increase earnings, so that beyond the further upgrade to each pod, a surplus will be generated large enough to cover the cost of the insurance policy.I think it is important to focus research efforts on those comets with a greater severity, rather than those with a greater chance of impact.Â  I recall a story told by a great computer-game designer, Sid Meier, who was responsible for the Civilization series of strategy games.Â  He spoke of when he set up his first games-design company, with a business partner who was an ex Air Force pilot.Â  Together, they had competed on an early, arcade-style Flight Simulator game.Â  Sid Meier beat the former pilot, because he recognised how the game mechanics differed from the flight mechanics that his competitor was used to.Â  I felt that the same was true of Risk Horizon, in that on occasion the risk mechanics were overshadowed by the game mechanics that were attempting to emulate them.Â  For me, the most incongruous element of the game was that element which represented 'community connections'.Â  Whereas all of the other game elements relied upon abstract decision-making, 'community connections' was an element of practical skill, and if one is a good gamer, it is possible to reach a level higher than that which reflects one's quality as a decision-maker.Â  But perhaps this was deliberate, to represent what the game designers consider to be the greater importance of community connections over physical defence measures  third-party insurance policies.An aspect that I would add to represent risk management choices in my country would be to somehow penalise the earnings of a player who accumulates too great a surplus of funds, therefore dimishing marginal utility, rather than allocating them effectively to furthering development or inhibiting damage/risk."87.220.238.93,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,1.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to

management, trying to combine thedevelopment of a little village withthe risk of suffer the shock of a comet impact, as a example of nature disasterin this case.Â The three steps that we have to combine arethe research of the event in order to obtain the most adequate protection andinsurance for probably damages.Â Â In my first attempt I did not understand thegame very well so I think that I over insured my village and over protected aswell, but afterwards I did understand that the money it was employed ininsurance and protection I could not employ it in development and I run out oftime to get the goal. On the other hand, I realized that a comet without anappropriate insurance could cause a harmful damage in my village so I had tofind the correct balance between these two situations.Â Â I played twice although eventually I almostget addicted. The first time I played I run out of time because I paid for thehigher insurance and that had got a high cost of opportunity for my villagedevelopment.Â The second time, there was a comet that causeda little disaster in my village despite of my level of insurance and protectionbut it was just only one comet and by a short difference between my degree of insuranceand the damage that caused, so I believe I get a very realistic simulationbecause I think that we are never protected for all kind of shocks in a hundredpercent level.Â At last I tried to do constantly things, Imean, first of all get the minimum insurance and afterwards I tried to developmy pods as much as I could at the same time I researched the comets andregulate the bar and insurance level for the appropriate protection accordingto my researches. Â That was the best waythat I found to be correctly protected and insured at the same time.Â Â The game is very funny and very simple to playand I think you can learn some basics about principal components in riskmanagement, so if I had to improve something, I think I would make some kind ofshelters apart in the development of the village. I would penalize more thedevelopment without adequate shelters for the size of the population, measure bythe number of pods. Trying to show the idea watched on videos about Chileâ€™s andHaiti earthquakes and the different damage caused by these disasters measure inhuman life quantity. Maybe this could make more understandable theimportance of human life over pod development.Â In summary it is a good game that let you tounderstand the key points of risk management and that the good balance betweenthese points is a powerful weapon to fight versus any shock.Â "94.113.220.82,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,1.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"1 - My choices and their effectsThe risk management allowed the civilization to evolve and prosper even in an environment of quite frequent disasters. My priority was to build and upgrade pods as much as possible to generate more credit - to be able to build protection and buy insurance. I always tried to be prepared for upcoming threats (comets) but in the end of the game (L6), reparations afterwards were the only thing I was able to do, since the occurrence of disasters was more and more higher. Having appropriate protection and doing research allowed me to cope with the aftermath better. The big role (maybe bigger than I would expect) played the insurance - having the highest level of insurance was usually the key factor of efficient coping with the impact of the comet (at least in my type of playing).2 - Main things learnedI played several times. I learned to understand the threat (learning about comet types) and use available information in order to be able to assess the threat and the minimal protection needed what helped me to stop over-protect my world (what was my biggest repeated failure at the beginning) and, hence, save the credit for the insurance, build more pod capacity so I hadÂ  more time for research. I also learned that timing was very important - or maybe more specific, managing the cash-flow was important to be able to build, upgrade and have time to research (and buy insurance). I learned to prioritize and act quickly. I was unable to determine whether it was better to build less pods but more upgraded (more expensive with increasing upgrades) or more pods less upgraded (harder to quickly repair after the hit, less productive). I was also surprised how big role the insurance played - I guess that the parallel would be that after the shock, money can provide the most effective coping since they can be transformed in (almost) any help/coping instrument necessary. In game, the recovery from disaster was more easier with insurance than it would be without it. I was not able to test whether it was better to go for any available insurance at the beginning and then buy the more expensive one (hence to build basics for improvement) or to wait until I had enough credit to buy the highest insurance (to safe money). The most interesting observation was that it was very hard for me ""read"" game behaviour and adjust my strategy according to it - I failed several times with one same strategy until I decided to change it. Actually, the longer I played, the worse game results I got. I guess I forgot to keep it simple and tried to make my strategy too complex. 3 - Tips for game improvementI would prefer to be able to test and experiment with particular sub-systems of the whole world. When I had an idea to update my strategy I had to start all over and other systems interfered with the one subsystem I wanted to test. It is like having the opportunity to train separately backhands and forehands in tennis before training them in a game. I would also welcome more information about the outcome of my strategy at the end, so I would be able to think about its upgrade.â€‹ During increasing my protection, I would also welcome to see the progress of its increasing, and not only the drop of my credit."77.44.182.163,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"First of all It is a useful , applicable , good game .. i found the enough example in understanding of risk managment , which had the big role in winning the game , by the effective Scientific using of researches , protection button and trade-offs i could protect my self from the comets..in our world's firms we could apply all of these components to protect our businesses and make it able to face risks, threats, and other outside conditions.Â in our life there are many kinds of shocks (famine, floods, economic collapse...) all of Â theseÂ we could face if we really apply what we learned from the game.while playing and when i gave the researches long time, i had the enough time with community connections so it helped me in long term protection Â and insuranceconnected Neighbors Â and community organizations help one another when a shock comesby sharing resources forming and sustaining .

The next couple of times besides insuring and researching I have learned to do some protection also, which included lifting up the surface of the planet so that when the meteor hit it would not cause a lot of damage to my objects.

Two basic choices to make was to invest in development and in protection of the community. However, there were also some smaller dilemmas; for example, should I spend time raising the terrain to mitigate the result of the asteroid / comet impact or should I spend time preparing the community by conducting research that would give me extra time to prepare the community response. Also, there were choices which path of development should I follow: whether I should develop more capsules / modules on a lower level of development, or should I focus on developing and upgrading 3 or 4 modules to higher levels.Â Therefore, the game was all about choices and dealing with the consequences of those decisions.I have played the game multiple times. The first time, I was able to reach level 3, but during my consecutive tries, I was failing to go through level 2. Eventually, I discovered that I was playing too safe and that I was not spending enough resources on development by the beginning of each level. Then, when I tried to balance costs of development and protection (insurance, safety by raising terrain, and rebuilding), immediatelyÂ I wasÂ more successful and I reached level 4 (or was it level 5 ?). However, I learned that at one moment, I was spending too much money on development, and if I was hit by a comet, I would have no money to rebuild the settlement. I was left with maybe 20 dollars and, despite having the insurance on the level of 75% payback, I would still have to have to cover 25% of the cost of rebuilding the community. Thus, the game taught me the importance of balancing between investing in development and in dealing with potential natural disasters.Â If I was to change one element of the game to make it better represent the risk management choices, I would try to make it more realistic and relevant. For instance, instead of taking place on a faraway planet, the game should take place somewhere in a developing country such as Bangladesh. There instead of meteors / comets, the player could be dealing with annual monsoons and other rains that could destroy the crops and endanger people's lives. Placing the game in such environment and context would make more sense in discovering what choices people in some place of the world have to make."84.253.74.162,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"I did not realize it was going to be so challengingand versatile.The game even showing imaginary planet is just theright description of the Earth problems.At the beginning I tried faster growth along withhigher insurance levels which in case of a shock led to severe damages and mademe start all over. Then I tried slower progress with more attention to theprotection and monitoring the comets. As a result I minimized the damage,caused by the shocks, reduced insurance and achieved slower but more stablegrowth. Monitoring comets helped for better predicting of the potential damageand planning resources for protection. The earlier I spotted the â€œharmful cometâ€ù,the better I could prepare for it. As we know collecting more data makesestimations more precise (Law of Large Numbers).The Insurance helped me to minimize and recover fasterfrom losses, although I found protection more useful.Also when I had some time left after reaching therequired level of development I tried to spend it raising the surface andstrengthening the protection. It helped reduce loses and make developmentsmooth in the next Level. This was some king of transferring spare resource (timeto build protection) over time.Through the levels the money was no longer an issue â€“the further you go, the more you get. The only problem was saving the progressin a limited period of time. So the time remained big issue and it became moreand more difficult to control and plan! Therefore it was critical to do yourbest in protecting the progress achieved. Even thought better protection madethe growth slower it improved resilience and allowed to avoid the damageorÂ to recover faster.It appears that theÂ balance isÂ crucial.Growth is in one hand and protection is in the other. Even if you think youhave enough resources and time â€“ one â€œstrike of meteoriteâ€ù can bring you backto the beginning. Therefore it is important to pay enough attention to the protectionand monitor the scene along with constructing. After reaching a higher level ofdevelopment the insurance becomes very important. Because repairing of manyupgraded houses costs really a lot (more than 75% insurance for 4 stages alltogether)! So the further you go the more attention you should pay to theinsurance. And when the ""black day"" comes it all pays off!Â Â In the place where I live there are no so many naturaldisasters to be afraid of luckily.

As the game progressed the player needed to balance the potential detrimental effects of the asteroid hits with the continuing development of their buildings. A player could ""research"" an asteroid which would allow the player more time after impact to minimize the damage. This is a common concept in real life, the greater you understand the risk itself and its potential impact on your endeavors the easier it is to plan for that risk. Also by understanding the risk you can take advantage of times when the risks are minimal and brace for periods when the risks increase. The game continued in this vein by allowing the player to purchase insurance to reduce the cost of repairs that the players buildings would need in the event of an impact. This again is familiar to any property owner (e.g. car, home, commercial property), the amount of insurance you need is not just the general value of the property but what will be needed to replace the property in the event of damage.Early in my first attempt at the game I concentrated only on building quickly to maximize revenue and ""guarantee"" my advancement. This strategy did not fair well, I was struck by several asteroids and was financially not in a position to cover the repairs to my buildings. After that attempt I used a more balanced approach, with every building came a purchase of insurance and an investment to ""protect"" (the little scale in the lower right) my building in case of a tragedy. I would then look for asteroids that would could do the largest amount of damage and spent the most time researching them to insure that I would have an opportunity to minimize their damage. This approach actually allowed me to progress to the 6th level (end of game). Also rather than spreading out constantly I concentrated at advancing the building I had so that I would be exposed to less financial strain in the event of an impact while still maximizing the revenue. I would have to say that the largest lesson learned form the game was to approach risk in a balanced manner, attempt to minimize the down-side while capitalizing on any opportunities.If I was tasked with developing a new version I would expand it in several ways. First I would allow the game to be networked (so that communities could work together) allowing players to join together to offset some of the risks among themselves. Secondly I would introduce other potential opportunity vehicles, such as allowing for the player to invest in some form of asteroid ""protection"" that could negate an asteroids' damage all together. Finally I would allow for the carrying-over of insurance protection from level to level, thus making the game a bit more in-line with real world events,"93.73.35.185,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk Management played the key role in this game. I had to evaluate simultaneously different indicators in order to take the right decision. There is a good quote from Â«1984Â»: All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. I can say that on trade-offs in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance. Everything was very important but I had to pick the most efficient Risk Management solutions. You really can't see the results immediately, but after some time you understand if it was a right solution or not.I played the game twice. The first time I lost at third level. The second time I achieved level four. Even losing the first time I gained experience. I got more Knowledge and understood how to fix my mistakes. But even playing the second time I understood the more you know the stronger player you become. I understood that you had not let the success mask your problems. Even when you win there are a lot things to be done. And evaluation of Risk Management effectiveness is the key to better results.The game captures, in a simplified way, aspects of risk management.If I had a chance to add one simple thing it would be cost benefit analysis in order to see the benefits in the form of avoided impact. It would be very similar as in real life when the results of risk management are not observable in the nearest future, they are being ignored.Working in the banking services industry I understand that a lot of banks here in Ukraine take excessive risks because they know they will be saved by Central Bank or Government.It all drives the banking system into more complicated situation, when management is weak and incompetent, and thus banks together with clients are more vulnerable. The Central Bank has to save those banks in order to increase social support and decrease protests of clients, who saved money as deposits in such problem banks. It creates a vicious circle. And solving this problem is very tough for the Government.Risk Management is always more efficient and cost effective in strategic perspective but not tactically as its benefits in not observable immediately.Â "68.39.177.42,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Risk Management played a critical role in building the pods and the development of the community, which in turn helped me in moving to higher levels of the game until it is complete. I have performed research on the comets, which helped me in dealing with the impact; I have raised the elevation of the island based on the severity  the hit chance characteristics of the comet thereby protecting the pods; I have obtained insurance to cover any damages caused by the comets and I have connected the pods in the community in the event of the damage so that the community is more robust going forward. The sooner I carried out research on the comets, added the insurance and raised the elevation of the development, the better it became in building the community, surviving the water damage caused by the comet hits and completing the development to move on to the next level and eventually resulting in reaching level 6.I have played the game more than once. After the first time, I understood that I needed to balance the acts of adding/enhancing pods to build the community, researching comets' characteristics and accordingly increasing the elevation of the community to avoid any potential damages caused by the waves due to the comet hits, and getting the right insurance to cover the damages if any. After carrying these actions in real-time in a concerted way, I was able to build the community and meet the development goals of every level and finally reached level 6. The key to success being adding more pods and or enhancing the pods there by reaching the community development goals of a given level and alsoÂ getting the right protection by raising the elevation of the development and purchasing insurance such that any damages caused by the comets are repaired/replaced by the insurance policy.Some of the things I would add/change to the game in order to enhance the risk management are - ability to raise the elevation of the island at a faster rate so that the waves causing water damage due to comet hits cannot reach the community and also add a new insurance option that covers 100% repair and or replacement costs. A novel option that could be added to the game is the ability to create mobile pods such that these pods can be moved far away from the comet impact points thereby protecting from the water damages and moving them back when there are no comet threats.Â Â "70.30.97.229,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,-13.0 to 3.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"Â Overview of the Game:The game captured succinctly the relationships between Risksand Reward.

Preparation is key and should be carefully planned.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk Management prevent damages: The knowledge ofdanger through Research provided an opportunity to deal with risk. ThroughResearch, one can easily detects sources of risks in the Game- Meteor, shocks,and, careful planning can mitigate against them.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk Management helps in analysis cost andbenefit. The identification of a Risk factor such as the Meteor and the probabilityof causing extensive damage allow Risk Manager to anticipate cost of damage andthe benefit of protection.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk Management helps in Decision Making. In thegame, I was able to make an informed decision by choosing appropriate insurancebased on the perceived level of risk and the stage of development. As theDevelopment progresses, the value of my insurance increases to mitigate againstdamage from Comets and to ensure enough coverage is available for repairs.Choices: Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I came to know through the game that Research isimportant to Preparation â€“constantly looking out for Meteors and measuring theirdistance to Earth helped my development strategy.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I made sure the â€˜Development Barometerâ€™ on theleft side of my Project Site stayed Green and constantly watched out for â€˜Redâ€™factors.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Elevating the Island by holding the Slider onthe Right when danger of comets beckon also helped in development.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I was able to buy Insurance to repairdevelopment damaged by floods.Trade-Offs Sometimes, I was able to measure and tolerate some levels ofRisk by not holding the Slider to save cost rather fill pods so very quickly,and making sure the Meter stays green.Â Preparation of Risk Affect Development:i.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â At the onset of Development, it helps to identifyand quantify risk through Research. For example, the danger of Comets fallingand causing flood provides opportunity to mitigate against loss of development.ii.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As development progresses, one is able toquantify the amount of Insurance Policy required to repair damages.iii.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â All through the development stages, keeping aneye on the horizons ensures constant protection.2.Â  If I was to play the Game again, what I woulddo differently?a. I will not panic at the onsetof Risk.b. I will be more deliberate todo Cost- Benefit Analysis c. I will be more prudent inspending my Budget by choosing appropriate insurance for each stages ofdevelopment.Lessons from the Game:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â When there is opportunity for Development, Riskis Inherent.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk is not all bad and can be quantified.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk can be prevented and can be transferredthrough insurance to enhance development.Â 3.Â Â  I live inOntario, Canada â€“ Some of the Changes to the Game to adapt to my Environmentwould be:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I would replace Comets with TornadoesÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I would seek to develop Parks instead of anIslandÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Also, I might develop a system that measure Rainfalland calibrates amount of rainfall into severity of flooding.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Finally, the game will have both English andFrench versions to meet up with Canadian Official Language Act â€“ Canada is aBilingualÂ Â Â Â Â Â  Country.Â "67.225.97.100,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"Therole of risk management in the game is balancing between risk preparation andthe communityâ€™s development. Within the limited resources of time and money, thegoal of risk management in the game is to build a strategy that can mitigatethe negative outcomes of being hit by the comets while creating theopportunities for the community to grow. Risk preparation plan is thecombination of three activities: knowledge (research), protection, andinsurance. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Knowledge (research) is to collectinformation about the potential risks and using that information for preparingthe response. Protection is the action that helps toÂ Â Â Â  prevent or reduce the losses.Insurance helps to recover the repairing cost and the time loss of thedevelopment.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  There is a trade-off among these activities. Forinstance, if spending a lot of times on the research, the developing progress willbe delayed. On the other hand, if spending too much money on protection orinsurance, there will be not enough resource to improve the community. The key is depending on the individualsâ€™ choices how to balance theseactivities for a better outcome. I made my choice based on my judgment whichrelied on the knowledge and onÂ available resources.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At first, I tried to build the pods asmuch as I could with all the money I had. As the time went by, the fund wasbuilt up, I then tried to prepare for the protection. When the comets appeared,I spent time for research to learn about the potential hits and the possibleoutcomes. The information obtained during the research helped me to determinewhether to raise the level of protection or to purchase an insurance policy. Ioften prefer to raise the protection level rather than purchasing an expensiveinsurance plan. Risk preparation affected significantly to the development insome ways: it could halt the developing process immediately due to run out ofmoney or the communityâ€™s improvement could be delayed after some time. 2.Â Â Â Â Â  Ilost level 3 in the first time. I paid too much attention on development; preparedless for protection; and ignored research and insurance. I got hit badly; itdamaged and destroyed almost 40% of my works. I had no insurance plan in place forrecovery and I had no time to make any connection with the community. I passedlevel 3 in the second time but failed at level 4. I changed strategy in thethird time: spending more times for research; raising the protection level; andpurchasing insurance at the minimum amount. Finally I was able to pass level 6.Thegame reflected a real life scenario where a community was facing with manypotential shocks and that could hinder its development. The main things that Ilearned from the game were the benefits of risk management; the relationshipbetween risk management and development; and some certain ways to manage riskseffectively.Â By balancing among the activities of risk preparation, thecommunity was able to meet its goal with limited resources of time and money.3.Â Â Â  Aswe have learned, risk management is a powerful instrument which can save lives,prevent crisis, and unleash opportunities for the development.Human lives are the mostimportant element in crisis management. Natural disaster is the highest risk forhuman being which can occur at anytime, anywhere in the world .If I was taskedwith developing a new version of the game, I would suggest adding human elementto the game. This element, in my opinion, represents the best interest of riskmanagement choices. Human capital plays an important role in development.Â Â "72.222.252.103,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Reflection- Risk horizongameRisk management involves manipulating resources to achievegrowth and development within the community. It requires awareness of potentialthreats and risk and putting in place protective mechanism to off-set loss andto cope when losses do occur. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  PreparationKnowledge and ProtectionThe process of researching the looming threat was valuable, butI also observed that the longer I spent on research, the more resources that becameavailable. This indicated that knowledge can allow for exploration of solutionsand the ability to choose the most efficient method relative to cost that canprovide protection. This also allows for evaluation of whether options aresocially or culturally acceptable. Â Therefore, money is saved directly as a result of avoidingloss and also indirectly by reducing waste from ineffective programs.Additionally, I thought that in the process of gathering information, newlinkages can be formed between public and private sectors and also regional andinternational communities and this bank of resource can later be used in theresponse to future threats which will further save time and money.Â However, lengthy or thorough research was not alwayspossible and therefore reliance on some sort of protection and insurance wasnecessary to offset the severity of loss. This was one aspect I found I had todo trade-offs, in that if a severe comet with direct threat loomed, I delayedresearch and instead opted to bolster the islandâ€™s protection whether throughbuilding projects or buying insurance. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â CopingInsurance and ProtectionIt was apparent while playing, that growth needed to be pacedand planned and also suited to the socioeconomic environment; such that despitethe urge to develop pods (make them bigger) and to raise the island, I alsoneeded to consider that insurance cost and repair would also be increased. Therefore,my approach to how I developed the pods changed while I played, I recognized thatprojects should evolve in such a way that maintenance of those more developed pods,for example, rolling out of high speed internet didnâ€™t unduly prevent othersectors of the island from being developed to meet the needs of the community,such as provision of rural roads for farming communities. Therefore, in thisway efforts to provide insurance could be afforded both for smaller towns aswell as major cities and their citizens. Â Road block: whatwould I change? Preparing effectively to meet and cope with risk is largelydependent on what is known about the risk. Whereas some shocks give littlewarning, such as an unexpected prolonged drought in the tropics, some shocksgive warnings and the impacts seen may be gradual, for example, the impact of energyprices on the production sector and the resultant impact on exports. During thegame it would be useful if one was able to forecast risk (warning prior tocomets coming in view) perhaps from occurrences in a neighbouring state, andthat during the protection and buying of insurance procedures there was theability to continue doing research on the comets (currently research is interrupted)so that early protective efforts could be put in place while continuing toadjust as the threat and risk changes. This would facilitate better use ofresources, including time and indicate where to focus efforts if multiplehazards are faced. "190.161.62.89,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"My 400-word essay My reflections from the Risk Horizon game:Answers:------------1a - What was the role of risk management in the game?Mainly develop a community with the constant risk of falling meteorites. Thanks to Risk management applied, I do it win until 5th stage in the second game. I believe about this game that is a good stuff to learn about risk management.1b - What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? I developed slowly into the community, provided a security framework to enable sustainability in case of a meteorite impact . First build 3 pod-home and increment the security, after I upgrade 1 level one pot-build and build the next pod.1c - In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?I could see that the preparation had a lower cost than rebuild the pod, so I kept the preparedness in high level. 2a - If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?The first time I played I lost in the second stage and I realized that the cost of reconstruction was very high, so I defined play a second time maintaining a high security level. Â 2b - Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time?The second time maintained a high level of security and over to grow the community. 2c - What were the main things you learned from the game?Better grow slower, ensuring a high level of protection against the risk and uncertainty.3 - The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I live in Chile, we have to face earthquakes, tsunamis, wildfires, floods, drought and landslides, depending the area of the country where you live. I think the only one meteorite fall explains to handling one type of risk, when in reality one faces a number of risks simultaneously. The changes I propose are a number of risks to manage different features and make the game multi language because in the world there are more people who dont speak English, if you really want to shared the game around the world is necesary do it.Thanks!!"193.227.170.162,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"The main role of risk management in the game is to confrontrisks (comets), prepare for them and cope with their effects in order to investin economic growth. In my opinion the game needed strategic planning to becompleted. Therefore, I have pursued a specific plan. When starting the game, Ihave noticed that protection is the most important tool to have an effectiverisk management and that protection and insurance depends on the knowledge wehave.In other words, I have increased the protection level andbought a more expensive insurance only if I knew that the severity and theprobability to be hit by a comet is high. During the game I have confrontedonly one trade-off: Balancing. To be successful in it, I have chosen toconstantly upgrade my pods to earn more money but at the same time I was highlyprotecting my land, and buying moderate insurance. Because I came up with aconclusion that if I have a high protection level, then I will not need anexpensive insurance to cover my losses, since comets will not or will rarelyhit my land. But on the contrary, if I buy the most expensive insurance anddonâ€™t increase my protection, then comets will bomb the land and I will beloosing a lot of money by repairing my pods.As far as I am concerned, in real life, preparation for riskdoesnâ€™t show its positive result until a risk emerges. And that can sometimestake years. Whereas in the game the preparation of risk affected developmentimmediately maybe because of the short time we had in each level.Â I have played the game several times to reach the 5thlevel. What I have understood is Â that spending more money on protection is more profitable rather than spendingan important amount on insurance. Moreover, I have noticed that when I reachthe next level, I am always broke. Thus, I have decided to save some money in the previouslevel once the development is accomplished, so I can enter the next level with money.During the video talks I have gained a full understanding ofrisk management but I have never implemented it in the real life. The game hashelped me to focus and think more about the importance of risk management inour lives. And I am now convinced that the delay in development in some ""countries in development"" is due to the fact that they donâ€™t spend enough timeon the implementation of risk management or they just tryto ignore the future. The most valuable think I have learned from this game ishow to choose the right balance by having the right strategic plan. At last,the game has widened my knowledge about risk management and now I have an ideahow to implement an effective risk management in reality.Â If I could get the chance to adopt the Horizon game topeople living in my country, then I would like to add one thing: A Second Land.I am actually living in a war area where preparing andcoping with risk is certainly not enough for us to survive the daily shocks. Atthis point, I would suggest adding a second land where we can build our podsaway from the war. The second land will not be available before the 4thlevel; the player will immigrate when he or she cannot support the large numberof daily comets and will have the opportunity to move to the second land after having a full knowledge about the risks that can occur there.

Thank you!1.1 Role of RiskManagement In the game:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The comets in the game posed as risk elements.Each comet had a different probability of hitting the planet with a variedamount of severity.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â By understanding this, one has to implement thebasic principles of risk management i.e. identifying the risk, preparing tocope with its effects and finding avenues of developmentÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The role of risk management was crucial as onehas to develop new pods, upgrade the existing pods in tandem with the comets(risks) hitting the planet.1.2 Choices andtrade-offsÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â While playing the game, to cope up with thedamage done be the comets, I chose to take insurance after developing 1-2 pods.I took the insurance cover for 50% in level-1 and level-2.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â However,in level-3 and level-4, I increased the insurance cover up to 75% as 5-6 podswere developed and upgraded.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As the number of upgraded pods increased, anincreased chance of damage was foreseen and hence I started investing cash onresearch and kept the protection bars (on the right) as high as four. 1.3 Preparation forrisk affects development:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â While playing level-1, one has ample amount of cashand initial cost of setting up pods in low. Hence development is not affecteddrastically in level-1Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â However as levels increase, the cost ofupgrading pods increase, the insurance costs increase and the number of comets(risks) increase.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There is a clear and direct correlation whereinpreparation for risk affects development drastically in subsequent levels. 2.1 Doing differentthings after playing the game more than once:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I played the game several times. When I playedit for the first time, I was aggressively developing pods, invested low ininsurance as well as on researching about the risk of severity with which thecomets would hit the planet. Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â After getting repetitive hands on the game, Iplanned the cash flow in a balanced way. I focused on development, communitybuilding as well as spending on research to lessen the damage from comets. Ialso took high risk cover in higher levels to minimize the damage and get riskcover. 2.2 Key thingslearned from the game:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Allocation of resources (cash) while planningrisk protection.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Knowhow of upcoming risks should be practiced tocounter those risks in an efficient mannerÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Community building is a powerful tool to counterrisks Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Diversification of resources (i.e. spending ofcash) among risk protection tools viz insurance and researching about risks ina balanced manner. 3.1 Adding/Changingone simple thing for newer version of game:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The research button should have numeric levelsof protection and there should be avenues of points which boost development interms of cash or shooting comets.3.2 Better representthe risk management choices that matter in the place you liveÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I live in a place where the risk of famine isvery high.

After few times I tried to start developing all thepods and postponing the development of pods on higher levels as it costs a lotto develop more developed pods, as well as to repair it that developing thecheaper lower level pods. The research in a game doesnâ€™t decrease the objectivetime given for each level, however after few times of playing game I learnt notto spend too much time myself on research.From thegame I learnt that it is a not an easy task to manage risk and that carefulbalance between available resources, available means of protection andinsurance as well as research have to be taken into consideration. I learntthat the measures taken should be in proportion with the situation and risks asthe mistake sin evaluations, mistakes in cost benefit analysis will mean lossesof time and finances, which otherwise could have been used for development orbetter preparation for more riskier situations. Answer on 3rdÂ  Â question:Â  If Iwould have been a developer for this game, I would also include the costs ofresearch depending on time spending for it as in real life researches sometimesare very expensive. If to take in regards to the country where I live (Denmark)the cost of researches are very expensive and thus my this suggestion to addthe timing and money costs Is absolutely reasonable.Â End of the document"41.206.11.12,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â The role of risk management in the game is Â tobalance development with all aspects of risk management like knowledge,protection and insurance. While playing the game the choice I made was afterlaying of few pods like three and upgrading them next provided protection to thepods against any future strike by raising the island bar and the main thing Idid that kept my pods intact was doing lots of research against any possiblestrike. Knowledge remains an important factorfor any community to remain safe of any impending danger, protecting the podsagainst any future danger pays off, if at the long run when disaster can bevery unpredictable. No need to spend too much on insurance if you can manageknowledge and protection very well. Preparing for risk will help boost development at the longrun because before any disaster we must have seen it coming and averted thedisaster this would reduce the time that should have been spent recovering fromdisaster and increase the process of development.If played once I would want to observe what conditions makesthe life bar increase faster. After playing the first time I decided to change manythings like spending time on research which will give me enough time inbuilding strong community connection when disaster happens and also raising theisland as high as possible to reduce any future chances of strike or effects. What I learned fromthe game is there is no point pouring money into development without protectingthe communities in which you've invested time and resources! It is far betterto build very high level of protection than wasting funds on disaster due toour ignorance. Also with lots of research we can avert major occurrence.If am to develop thegame in other way I would want to provide free support in terms of funds andwant to know how the community is making use of the funds at some point in thegame and decides if to continue to help out of their good performance or to stopand see if things would change."112.119.221.194,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management is the core theme of the game.Â  Managing risk in a balance way is the way toplay the game, same with the reality of development.Â  You cannot succeed if you have knowledge butlacking in protection and insurance or have protection but lacking in knowledgeand insurance.Â  Same if you haveinsurance but knowledge and protection is not enough.Â  You must strike a good balance between allthree dimensions to manage your risk and achieve development goals.Â  One more thing, community connection is veryimportant in the game as a form of both insurance and protection.Â  It is a reality in development called socialassets.Â  It can provide protection,insurance and knowledge, including other forms of coping mechanism to avoidirreversible coping strategies for both at the household and the communitylevel.Â  Development is most likely tosucceed if the whole community and stakeholders are onboard from the beginningof any development initiative, which is very obvious in the game.Â  You cannot progress if you have very fewpods.Â On my first game, I focus on protection and insurance.Â  I put up few pods, took maximum insurance andfocus on raising the island hoping that it will manage my risk better.Â  But, it took a tool on my development becauseI focus too much on the anticipated shocks and give little attention toresearch.Â  Obviously, I did not gofar.Â  The development was hindered byfocusing too much on the anticipated shocks and on protection.Â As I keep on playing, I realized that research (knowledge)is very important to managing the risk.Â Also, the pod must have at least a balance progress of development tohave better community connections.Â  The more the pods the faster the progress of development.Â As inreal life, you have to strike a very good balance on all the dimensions of riskmanagement namely, knowledge, protection and insurance to achieve yourdevelopment goals and all stakeholders must be involve from the beginning(community connections) to have a better chance of success.

The role of risk management in the game is to find such a balance of using the options to achieve certain level of development.The immediate effect of preparation is a reduction of development growth, i.e. more we spend on preparation, lesser resources are available for revenue generation.On the other hand, if the preparation was not paid enough attention to address the high probability of meteor impact and its severity, the damage of actual meteor impact was very high and draw substantial resources out from development.If balanced properly, the investment in development in the long run results in higher returns which allows to increase investments in protection and yet support required development growth rate.2) I have played the game several times. By adjusting different tactics in the use of preparation options, I could manage to increase the revenue and successfully overcome Level 4 at the fourth attempt.Initially I chose a very cautious approach and invested too much in protection and insurance. Thus, the resources were not wisely spent to development growth.Afterwards, I started carefully balancing use of funds with a bigger emphasis on development yet investing sufficient funds to mitigate possible impact of the meteor attacks.The game is an interesting approach to learn to optimize management decisions in the environment of limited resources and risks presented.3) Indeed, the game is only a very simplified model of what real world with actual risks could be.If change to the game is possible, I would suggest to give a payer a choice of adding new risks. The user would have an ability to set the new risk's features that would, as per the user's thinking, reflect the reality of the area where the user lives. That, I believe, would allow to simulate conditions that are closer to specific region or industry, thus allowing the user to search for better management solutions in risk management.Another suggestion is to create more games for different areas / industries. For example, the type of risks could vary for a game for educational sector and for a game for roads construction or health industries, etc.Thanks!"75.69.227.177,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"In the game Risk HorizonÂ the role of risk management was touse the available tools: buy insurance, research the comets, and lift thesettlement, to further the goal of settlement development. These toolsrepresent Insurance, Knowledge, and Protection, respectively. The trade-offconfronted was in balancing the cost-benefit that each provides whilemaintaining adequate monetary resources for Coping and advancing development. In deciding how to allocate resources themarginal utility of each risk management tool was evaluated. For example, thecost to lift the settlement further increased as it was raised. The additionalprotection provided for an additional unit of height becomes less than thebenefit available from the other risk management tools for the same cost. The cost to raise the settlement, buyinsurance, or spend time researching the comets directed resources away from thebuilding and upgrading of pods in the short-term. The benefits of thesepreparations were captured when the settlement was hit by a low to moderateseverity comet. The most severe comets were, in my experience, disastrous evenwith a combination of insurance, protection, and the benefits of communitynetworks gained from researching the comets. These preparations did, however,allow the game to progress into the 4th level even though the paceof development was slower than when resources were directed primarily at podconstruction and upgrading.Several rounds of the game were played inorder to experiment with different levels of each risk management option. Themost successful strategy over time was to allocate resources in relativelyequal amounts. One lesson learned was that the highest insurance coverage wasnâ€™tusually worth the extra cost, since the additional price above the lowestinsurance could provide greater utility when used to lift the settlement fromthe starting position. More generally, the lesson from the game was that riskmanagement requires a multi-pronged approach.An enhancement to the gamemight involve a user controlled income adjustment. This would allow the user,prior to the game start, to choose what income level the settlement will have.This feature would allow the user to experiment with the trade-offs of eachrisk management tool under different resource constraint scenarios."14.161.30.80,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Did you know that the primarythreat to Alora is comets?

This taught me that the infrastructure needed to mitigate therisk is not sufficient and need to be improved in the areas of Research as wellas resources for building more number of pods as well as for repairing themafter damage caused during devastation.Â Similarly, Insurance cover also, need to be enhanced to 90% from currentmaximum cover of 75%.Â  In this way, wecan gain knowledge through better research and transfer the risk to some extentthrough insurance.Â Â  In emergencies, theprotection tool may be mitigated with the help of state.But, I found it difficult in researching more than one cometat one time, when two or more comets are sequentially targeting the Island. Itis systemic and sequential risks. I was allowed to monitor and research onlyone Comet at a time, hence the time to research multiple Comets at one time isnot possible.Â  Hence, it was difficult toresearch and gain knowledge to cope with and come out of devastation andresilience successfully.Â  But, the Researchtool is a wonderful tool for gaining knowledge, severity and probable chance ofhitting are really wonderful and quite helpful in estimating the severance forpreparedness.We could easily do the development of Pods to create shelterand repair the damaged ones at a quicker phase with the help of resources fromthe state as well as from the insurance claims.Â But this has been a quite routine task for the Islanders, as thedevastations are quite frequent affair.Â Hence, it is quite obvious to get prepared to cope with challengingsituations all the while without any negligence. Insurance, is a great relief and risk transfer tool forfaster resilience from shocks.Â  Here, agood thing is that buying an insurance cover according to the severity isexperienced right instead of buying blanket cover.Â  Similarly, not buying an Insurance cover isalso not correct, as the entire cost of devastation is quite sever and to beborne by the state and people of the Island.Â Hence, Insurance cover acts as risk absorbent tool.Â  Which is a must along with Research andProtection to minimise the risk.Â  Protection tool also worked well, but it is a very costlyaffair too.Â  I found this tool is anexcellent tool, but could be used only during the heavy devastation and whenthe sea level is going up and causing submerge of the Island.Â  Hence, using this tool sparingly and needbased is a right thing to do.Â Â  In all the game has given me an experience of real lifesituation.Â  If I were in the situation,how I would mitigate the risk with available tools.Â  What more tools are required was felt in thecase of feasibility of research for multi comets.After devastation the community coordination and helpingeach other is one of the new method which has been introduced in the game.Â  Which has helped them to recover fast fromthe shocks.I would like to thank you the WB team for giving me thisopportunity.Best RegardsRamaneswara Rao Rongala"194.129.64.45,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The role of Risk Management in the game was primarily to create awareness of the main conditions and tools available to be able to face the incoming risks and more specifically threats. It helped model the decisions in terms of level of protection, transfer and knowledge at any one time as well as thinking about the future. The preparation of risk needs to be looked at in a holistic manner as over investment and under investment in risk management will affect the overall development in the long run. in the mean time it was demonstrated that the preparation for risk development can be seen and measured over time as the level of preparation and future proofing could be monitored and analysed at the end of each level.Â I played the game a couple of times and after the first time I realised that a combination of mitigation measures needs to be taken into account (i.e. transferring by means of insurance the risk may not be always necessary if there are other means available to protect the development, assets and investment which will ensure meeting the goals and reach objectives in the long term. It is also important to take into account the fact that the more the community is developed the better and greater resources and tools are available to cope and face risks. I could be seen after playing the game that the community affected/benefited by the risk management development play an essential role in the proactive improvement of mitigation actions and risk exposure levels by contributing to the overall development level which in turn provided greater resources available to invest in risk management actionsIf I was to develop a new version of the game I would probably include other threats such as internal events (seismic/volcanic) that would in effect incorporate other types of risks that are not only external and although they do not encourage looking at the horizon it could instead symbolise internal factors that contribute to the presence of threats and opportunities. The game could also be represented in a more earth like planet with different climatic/environmental threats and not only comet like but as stated above internal or external events such ass floods, droughts, etc. I was not really clear as to the real use of the research concept given in the game and I would probably introduce a different way to utilise this concept throughout the game as I find it to be an important aspect of the risk management process."166.82.216.14,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  What was the role of risk managementin the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront interms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation forrisk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Â The role of risk management was to engage you into having a balance asto what you use to build your community. For example you could not build manypods or you ran out of money, or if you donâ€™t have insurance, you would pay alot more to rebuild your community. Also noted was, that the more knowledge youhad about whether or not a comet would hit, you could prepare the island toprevent more serious damage. At times you were warned that the comet was goingto hit with a high rate of probability, thus letting you know that is better tobuild until the comet hits.Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â If you played the game only once, what wouldyou do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you playedthe game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? Whatwere the main things you learned from the game?Â I played the game several times, each time learning something new, atfirst I just build and build without looking at the knowledge, protection orinsurance alternatives but I did not survive very long.Â  The second time I was aware of my options andI used them with some bit of luck, I still did not have enough knowledge toplay the game right.Â  The third time Iwas using all three options and the game started to make sense and I actuallymade it to level three. One has to think about the community as a whole and notas a separate entities within the community.Â We have to be connected to each other to stand a catastrophe and bethere for our neighbors in the hour of need.Â As a planner one must have a sharp eye and not to do much of one thingfor the community but to do several things at once to equalize the economy.Â 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â The game captures, in a simplified way, someaspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a newversion of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. Whatchange would you propose to better represent the risk management choices thatmatter in the place you live?Â One thing I would add is proper approval of having something in writingto ensure no one has more saying power in the neighborhood. Major developerslike to step in into a community and rape the land and the government officialsbend backwards to let them in. Many times the developing areas do not go asplanned and after the land has been stripped of much needed trees all is leftbehind in search of a better deal, while the community left behind is nowresponsible for the cleanup.Â "82.3.100.207,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"Â The role of risk management was to provideinformation for risk protection of the world of Alora. Through the process ofconstruction and development of Alora, a bund of information involving researchregarding the fall of meteorites at the Alora seacost, I could measure anddistribute the share of development, insurance and infrastructure protection incase of a meteorite fall. Â After investing at the starting of thebuilding protection, I choose to invest in insurance protection at 50% ratefrom levels 1-4. This initial trade-off worked well, because the insuranceprotection gave opportunity to invest more in the world development.Additionally, through gathering information by the bund of research graphicabout the risks of meteorite impact, I could choose how much of the wealthdisposable I would invest at the world protection. After each meteorite fall, Icould reduce any risk of damage by the sharing of information through thedifferent buildings. Â I played the game 4 times, and each time Iimproved the distribution of wealth more equally between development andprotection of the world of Alora. At each different time I played, I learnedhow much is important to distribute more equally the wealth in order to furtherdevelop the world buildings and their security. Additionally, I learned that ifI invest just in development, the risk of damage increased, making moreexpensive to repair the world. Therefore, the trade-off between risk andinsurance was good. Â The next time I played, I invested more ininsurance and infrastructure protection. However, I learned that the populationwas not happy was heavy investment in protection instead of buildingdevelopment. In the fourth time I learned that that a better distributionbetween insurance, infrastructure protection, and building development wasgood. Thus, a more equilibrated trade-off was the way to go. The sharing ofinformation about the fall of meteorites further enhanced the happiness andwellbeing of the population of Alora.Â In the end, the game was a good andsimplified way to illustrate how important the investment on research,insurance, infrastructure protection, and mechanism of information sharing, arefor the wellbeing of citizen and further development of a society. I believethat all mechanism of risk management protection have to be presented separatedof financial products. It has to be shown that insurance protection primary workas a form of investment into the wellbeing and development of a society, notthe monetary enrichment for safeguard of live standards."213.57.43.234,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Therole of risk management in the game:Onthe one hand, we want to build as much as we can the community, but there is adangerOf cometsdestroying the assets built.Thereforewe should invest part of the resources in Â knowledge,protection, and insurance.Theknowledge help us to learn about the severity of the threat and the probabilityto get heart.Whenthe threat is severe with reasonable probability or thereat is medium with highProbabilitywe should get prepared by buying protection and/or insurance.Theprotection helps when the shock happens, the insurance helps to mitigate thedamagesAfterthe shock Â already happened.Wehave to find the balance between building more houses and preparing for disasteronTheother hand, putting too much resources on preparing for risk will not allow toenlarge the community, so the strategy is to build as much as possible and whencomes a threat as described above â€“ buy protection and insurance, divide themoney Â on both, but not moreThan30% of the assets.Theresearch is mandatory in order the asses the severity of the threat.Â If Iplayed the game only once I'd purchase more protection and insurance relativelytomanyrepetitions of the game, since in a one game play a shock might destroy all theassetsevenwhen the probability is not high, so the mean(expectancy) is the same, butstandarddeviationis much larger for a 1 game play.

Â When a hit was ""certain"", I invested more in protection and upgrades to the pods to prevent damage; and if severity was high, I bought additional insurance. Â I found that more insurance helped when I needed it.

It brings to the fore the high level of negative impact that that risk can have on development initiatives and the relevance of risk management initiatives in reducing the severity of the impact arising out of risk in any given situation. The combination of forecasting disasters, insurance against their effects; and protection of the island provided an ideal ground for the growth of the community which growth is eventually also vital for funding further investments aimed at protection and insurance. The game also teaches us the importance of ensuring a balanced approach when implementing risk management measures pointing out that an overreliance on one over the others may not adequately prepare you to face the potential impacts arising out of risk.Â During the course of gameplay, one major tradeoff was that between researching for further knowledge on the impending disaster and protecting the island from the disasters impacts and from this I learnt that while itâ€™s important to try and understand the potential impact of an upcoming disaster, it was also vital to put in place measures to mitigate the disaster and that often we tend to prioritize one over the other to our detriment. Another important tradeoff was that between protection and wealth creation in which I learnt that measures aimed at protection will draw from the wealth of the nation while at the same time negatively impacting the process of further wealth creation. This in turn meant that the initiatives one would have taken such as insurance and research on the upcoming disaster are put on hold once the focus is turned to protection initiatives.Â Multiple times of play taught me the importance of balancing the different aspects of the game as well as the power that social connections have in addressing the impact of disastrous events. After the first few frustrating failures, I learnt to make sure that my research on the upcoming event was better thus providing me with ample time to forge strong community connections in the event of a disaster occurring. I found that even the highest level threats could have their impacts slashed so long as the community connections were vibrant and alive.If I was to be involved in game development, I would incorporate the impact of rapid development on the environment as one of the factors to manage during the gameplay period. This is because in the real world, we have to contend with such issues and it would also force us to explore the wider issues that climate change is bringing such as rising sea levels and changing seasons. These have a wider impact on the ability of communities to recover from disasters especially since food resources which are vital in recovery process are directly impacted."94.210.128.178,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in this game, was to teach about how to best judge risk and prepare for threats to the development. This included having to keep an eye on risk on the horizon, to research the risk (will it hit or not, and of yes, how much damage will it likely cause). Â It required the player to at times trade off the benefit of adding to the development bar, against having money ready to spend on insurance, upgrades or additional buildings. Â It also meant that not only only did you have to respond quickly to any potential threats on the horizon, but when linking communities (the yellow highlights that appeared) it taught you to respond quickly to any disasters as soon as they happened, in order not to hamper development. Â I tried to assess the risks, and plan my responses before disaster struck, whether this was to increase my insurance, or ensure that I had enough money ready and available to spend for repairs immediately when needed.

Canberra, the relatively 'new' (1908) purpose built capital of Australia is surrounded by shrub-land, (called the bush) which in Australia's extremely dry, and hot environment, is prone to what's known as bush fires, intense fires that quickly spread through huge areas and in 2003, almost risking the existence of the city itself. I believe this is a suitable example to be used in this sort of risk management game.

I did the game a few times, and in eachone I was realizing the importance of planning and have to have protection. Myinitial reaction was to build refuges, but then I realized that what I neededfirst was insurance, because the losses could be so big without it that atleast a basic insurance coverage was worth it. In real life people tend to actfirst (build refuges) rather than think what is the best strategy and we wasteso many resources doing the wrong things. I also realize that the game focuseson the importance of savings. If I had savings from one level to the next, Icould buy a bigger insurance right away, and then I could focus on building orupgrading the refuges and in building knowledge. As in real life, the better preparedI was from the beginning the better outcome. Â The other similitude is the absolute lack oftime to make up your mind and do something. You have to choose among youralternatives in a quick way and this rush sometimes led me to mistakes. With experienceI learned which choices to pick first and how to build a better money cushionfor the future. In the game as in real life you have to chose quickly and yourpast actions have an important effect on your future. Other similitude withreal life is that once I had suffered a major impact, I was more willing to docertain things first and I realized that having a larger insurance was the bestpossible strategy, given the size and frequent meteor impacts.Â One thing I would change in the game is the way collaboration is addressed. My understanding was that you could build/strengthen your relations just when a meteor hit and there was almost no time to do it.

Role of risk management in the game is that how I choose the insurance plan (33%, 50% or 75%) for the pod I have. I must calculate or guess how much I need to prepare if the fireball hit my place. And the trade-offs here is that, I wait for the fireball come near to my planet, and choose the insurance plan which is most suitable with the percentage of hitting; however sometimes I buy a high insurance plan but there is no damage or less damage, and it is somekind of wasting money.2. The first time I try, or can be said in case if I have only one chance to play, I try to save money to increase my pod level as high as possible. For example, I create 3-4 pod, then upgrade 2 to level 2, and then wait for enough money to upgrade the 3rd one and so on. However, if the fireball hits the planet, the cost is so high even I pay for the insurance (even 33% or 50%). That is why from the 3rd time, I try to cut of the waste time, at the time all of the pod upgrade, I will upgrade or create the new pod right away. It depends on how much money I have at this time. Also the insurance, at the time the fireball nearly hits my planet, I will choose the highest insurance that fits my current money. The thing I learn in this game is how to save time also money for upgrading and buying insurance.3. If I can change one simple thing, I will add the rocket to destroy the fireball. With the fixed price for the rocket, I will think about whether buy rocket or not after comparing its price with the insurance.

The game alsoshows how community network is central to recovery after a disaster. I did several games, and I started without a high level of protectionand insurance. I was able to build quickly, and level after level, I have grownmy insurance and protection. I felt I have reached a higher level when using anintermediate level of insurance: it allowed me to have enough money to build.On the next parties I did, I chose to have a maximal insurance and protection,and was not able to build as much â€“ and eventually failed the level. I foundthat a too high level of risk preparation entails that development will beslower (but safer). The game shows well how risk preparation is essential.2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Now that I have done a few games (Ihave tried 4 times), I would play again using a 50% insurance instead of 75%and see if you can get to a higher level. I would also more take research intoconsideration.The main things I have learned from the game is how development and riskmanagement are intertwined and need to be run in parallel. I found it interestingto use the community to lower the consequences to the disaster.3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  If I was to change a little thing inthe game, I would diversity the threats coming (maybe I havenâ€™t gone far enoughto see other threats than the falling stars). For instance, have earthquakes,floods, building falling apart after some time (they need renovation), afinancial crisis. For instance, for a financial crisis, the money given wouldbe lower during a â€œfinancial crisisâ€ù level, so the money should be use evenmore carefully. There would be several insurances to choose from, and severallevel of protection, so the game would be a little more complex. "142.162.94.31,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of riskmanagement in the game is too maximize development while maintaining a balancebetween protection, insurance and research. The main objection is too developthe property as fast as possible to maximize the profits and returns, howeverwithout the proper protection and adequate insurance the development of theipods are at risk to damage and subsequent loss. Research is important since itreveals statistics with the severity and probability of a strike. With thisinformation, the developer has the knowledge to prepare for the comet; ensureadequate protection and insurance if severity and probability of a strike ishigh or else continue to build the ipods if the probabilities are low. I foundthat it was a must to have good insurance coverage as in the event of a cometstrike the cost of repairs were low and much faster to execute. Mediumprotection also kept repair cost and repair time low and in many cases escapeddamage altogether. The more time spent at risk preparation the more thedevelopment suffered, so therefore it was crucial that focus was on thedevelopment and to maintain the right balance of research, protection andinsurance to cope with the potential damage from the comets.Duringthe first few attempts at the game, I spent too much time analyzing the comets,keeping too much of a cash reserve and thus ran out of time in level 3. Ichanged my approach to get development started quickly, maintained a low cashreserve to maximize the development, purchased the maximum insurance andincreased the protection when a comet with high potential for damage wasapproaching. This approach got me into level 4 of the game.I wouldkeep the game as is but would add an automatic warning device to alert thedeveloper when the severity and probability of a comet strike exceeds a setthreshold. This way the developer could spent more time focusing on built andupgrading the ipods and focus on increasing protection as required."136.159.132.162,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in this particular scenario wasto develop a space nationâ€™s pods while mitigating the risk of comets. There are3 ways to do so, namely was by either protecting the settlement by raising iton a platform, purchasing insurance, or by upgrading pods in order to get agreater amount of return. Knowledge on how each of these mechanisms performedwas crucial to certain choices. For example, in the initial stages, it wasimperative to sink a significant portion of capital in to insurance andprotection in order to protect whatever little pods were present (just 2 or 3).However, care need to taken to not overdo this as low wealth can be cripplingto development. Next, it became clear that the focus shifted to the actualconstruction of pods and their development. It seemed more prudent to upgradeall pods to certain stage before moving on in order to prevent disparity.Additionally, the balance between insurance and protection played a key factor.As time progressed, it was apparent that although a certain level of protectionwas required, a medium level (about 5 to 6 bars) was sufficient to mitigatedamage by pairing with the highest level of insurance. This optimization allowsfor the cheapest repairs though protection needed to maintained at 6 barsconsistently in the event of a meteor strike.Â And finally, knowing which type of comet was going to strike was veryimportant. Comets with low damage and low probability could effectively beignored, while those with medium to high damage required the most attention, regardless of probability. Patterns start to arise once the game is playedmultiple times. For example, with an impending strike of 2 or more cometsconsecutively, it was more prudent to repair immediately after the first strikeat earlier stages (when protection was lower) otherwise there might not havebeen any pods to repair at all. But once protection was sufficient, repairsmay be handled after the second strike in order to reduce costs. The gameserves to teach that knowledge is most important and that a certain balance ofinsurance and protection are extremely important (having only one or the otheris not sufficient to mitigate all of the risk). Also having connections wereimportant too, though having a smaller impact. I would change the connectionmechanism within the game. Perhaps this element could be made to better reflecthow international organizations or NGOs provide relief. It could be done insuch a way that certain agreements or tasks have to be satisfied (for overallcooperation or peace) for this separate entity to assist in the recovery of the settlement."190.194.217.136,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"I played three times, until I got the fifth level and I understand the balance between investing in growing and protecting by investing in insurance and reaching levels.Â At the end, I realized that without enough protection there was no point in growing in number since I kept investing in rebuilding. So the way of having a growing and safe community was to invest in protection as it grows. Growing should be not only in quantity but in quality to get more financing resource even if better infrastructure costs more to rebuild, it is also more resistant, as we can see the not connected houses suffers even more for not having Â community chain.Having better insurance for the more developed buildings also helps financing the high cost they have and those are very important since they lend the higher financing for the rest of the community.

Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages.Â -manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks.Â -invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis.Â -the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles.Â The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risksThe game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones. Â  Â Â In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, "" Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity"". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community.Â "204.101.11.5,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,1.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"1-Â Â Â Â Â What was the role of riskmanagement in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did youconfront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways didpreparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Â The role of risk management in the game wasto protect the development planet Alora.At first, you donâ€™t even have the knowledge of what you should/can do to managethese risks. As you build youâ€™re understanding of the risks you are facing andhow they relate to your tools to prevent/minimize damages you get better atevaluating risks and choosing the best response.It is really important to choose yourresponse according to the riskâ€™s characteristics, not doing so can have seriousnegative impacts on development. For example, in the game, meteors move atdifferent speed. Slow meteor leave you more time to prepare: Do research andbuild protection but with faster ones, sometime itâ€™s impossible to be fullyprepared in which case itâ€™s better to buy insurance to limit the damage.There are also important trade-offs,Insurance is often an easy quick solution, but as the game progresses itbecomes more and more expansive, but if you started building protection early,this investment remains from a phase to the other and give you a long lastingsecurity solution. This investment is rewarded by the fact that you cancompletely ignore low severity risks and concentrate on development if yourprotection is higher than the cometâ€™s risk severity.Â 2-Â Â Â Â Â If you played the game onlyonce, what would you do differently if you were to play it again?Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you dodifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned fromthe game?Â The first time, I guess I was really riskaverse, this game/course being about risks, so I almost immediately boughtinsurance (for no good reason because there was no imminent risk). So Iminimized the risk right at the beginning but I also slowed down development byusing these resources for a temporary solution to a problem I wasnâ€™t evenfacing yet. I died at level 3.I played a second game, maximizingdevelopment and building protection early and steadily. Only when I assessedthat protection and research wouldnâ€™t be enough to cover the risk would I buyinsurance. I won the game.I learned from the game that limited resourcesmust be optimized to manage risks in a way that minimizes negative impacts ondevelopment.Â Â 3-Â Â Â Â Â The game captures, in asimplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked withdeveloping a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add onesimple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the riskmanagement choices that matter in the place you live?The game already features all of the riskmanagement activities: Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping.

In order to reach level four, Ihad to choose between development/financial risks and rewards (such as investingin building more pods to earn more income), as well as time management (whetherto spend time researching, and thereby offsetting the impact of the meteors, orupgrading my pods), and insurance (such as buying the higher-priced insuranceto offset the costs of rebuilding). Preparation for risk affected developmentin that it was impossible to focus on one aspect of the village, likedeveloping the pods or raising your village, as it would impede your levelprogress and ultimately result in failing the level. Once the village haddeveloped somewhat, the increased income made the investment in insurance aneasy choice to make, thereby making the ""advanced"" village mucheasier to repair after disaster. Though the simulation was a simple approach todisaster risk management, there are great advantages in having income to spendon disaster risk insurance and other preparations for recurring disasters.On the second game, Itook much more risk than my first and very conservative approach. I focused on1) building three pods with no upgrades in order to begin making moneyimmediately, 2) buying the second insurance option, which was less expensive,3) raising my village only to about 30%. Not a single meteor hit during thislevel, allowing me to take more financial risks. In the next level, I boughtmedium-level insurance, focused on raising my village to protect against futuremeteorites, and began upgrading all of my pods. I did not sustain any damageduring this level because of my protection. But I did discover that if Iinvested too heavily in raising my village, I would lose the level. I changedmy approach on the next game, and was much more moderate in balancing building,protection, insurance, and research.However, the challengewas not entirely based in finances. I also learned there was a considerableamount of strategy and time management skill involved, particularly in""researching"" dangerous meteors. I think if I were tasked with makingone change to the game to better represent risk management choices in theUnited States, I would make research an economic cost, and allow players todevote a certain percentage of income to ""RD,"" much as the U.S.does in investing in emergency management and crisis response activities."213.93.36.36,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The game risk horizon enables the player to take on the roleof risk management of a fictitious community that you have to build. The gamerequired you to think strategically in balancing knowledge, protection,insurance but also coping when your strategy did not work out as you planned. Agood balance between knowledge, protection and insurance was difficult to findas I tended to over-insure (selecting the highest insurance option if I hadenough cash) in an attempt to alleviate the damage when any comet wouldeventually hit. I did not invest enough in building and upgrading new pods andfailed to protect those I had from incoming waves. This affected my developmentadversely. Knowledge was gained through the tutorial and experienceplaying the game increased your knowledge of what strategies worked better thanothers.

With different scenarios (natural and humanitarian disasters,disease outbreaks, etc.) you would have to keep changing strategies to solvedifferent forms of risks.

To make these choices, there was always the need totrade up the price of some items in order to get others. I always had to makesure I did not put all my money-resources just on knowledge-research, or justfor protection, nor just for purchasing insurance.

Some of these risk management could be done bypreparing in advance through the laying down of sandbags, building of dams toprotect homes from flooding or by putting houses on stilts. When shocks such asdrought, floods, famines or loss of job by a household strike, it might be toolate to protect or buy insurance, but you can still make community connections.The game was very nice and may be, because I studied thecourse material and went through the videos before playing, I did play the gamejust once.Â  If I were to play the gameone more time, I will first of all bear in mind that the resources I am workingwith are very limited. This is because I learnt from the game that everythingwe do has some cost whether in time or resources, and such is the way of life ina world where nothing comes easy. Â Withthis in mind, I will make sure I put resources on research, while making surethere is enough protection, as well as affording better insurance that would beuse to pay for any damage on my pods (communities).Â I learned from thegame that, community protection is a type of insurance. When disaster strikes, wecan help each other survive by sharing resources, thus, forming and sustainingconnections is very valuable in risk management. I also learned from the gamethat preparing in advance can serve a lot of lives and property when animminent disaster strikes. I live in a community made up of many students. In additionto research, protection and insurance, a rubric for financial aid could beadded in the game. This aid will be paid in the next level of the game afterthe player fails to make it.

It was impossible to win the game without risk management. At least 2 meteors impacts were in all levels. Moreover, some of them could cause serious impact on the village growth and would cost a lot of money to repair. That money would then not be available to pick up growth after the crisis. The role of risk management in the game had several trade offs. More time spent to investigate the meteors, more time one got to connect and prepare the houses in a case of a crash and flood. However, more time exploring, less time to build protection. On the other hand, protection building slowed growth, took long time and money, but was worth it when enough protection was available in a case of a crash and flood. Insurance were expensive, but efficient regarding supporting growth. Especially, when a big impact and likely to crash meteors were on their ways.The strategy that worked best for my was to build a few buildings and update them as soon as possible. Then I added new housing projects as resources allowed. In the early stages, I was active creating protection to level 60-70%, then I was active exploring meteors to see the severity/likelihood ratio. Of all the risk management tools, protection building was the most important. Then I balanced buying expensive insurance or increase protection about 20% levels above the severity of the meteor. Insurance are more important in the upper levels as one needs to be very focused on growth and cannot spend all the time on building protection. The value of the insurance depended on my cash status. When I had a lot of cash available in the bank, I usually did not purchase the most expensive insurance, especially in the early stages. However, in the case of a high impact meteor was coming, then I did buy the most expensive insurance. You needed to buy new one after each level and they got more expensive with more updated houses. Unfortunately, the price did not go down with more protection. My biggest learning from this game was to find the balance between the different risk management options with learning and exploring the meteors. Moreover, managing risk and building protections all the time you have available from supporting growth.It would improve the game to have more risk factors, like food shortage or water pollution.

Thus, the role of risk management in the game is to minimize loss which is derived from risks and maximize gains which are found in opportunities. The preparation for risks required the application of knowledge, protection and insurance. Depending on the situation, these three measures may be applied collectively or individually. Moreover, whilst playing the game the tendency was to negate protection and adequate insurance with aÂ  preference to knowledge; since this measure would have allowed the player to gain pertinent information on the pending risks. The knowledge gained allowed the player to concentrate on protection by raising the community barrier and purchase appropriate insurance. It should be noted that additional information guided the player on the level of protection that was absolutely necessary;Â  hence, there was no need to increase your protection beyond a particular level. Emphasis therefore, was placed on adequate insurance, but more importantly, gaining knowledge on the pending risks. Generally preparation for risk positively affects development immediately or sometime after disaster struck. However the level of impact was highly correlated to the type of mitigating measure that was applied. For example, if the player had invested all of his money on his pods, bought minimum insurance and invested zero dollar in knowledge and protection he would have been negatively affected by a disaster. For positive impact to be felt there ought to be the careful application of mitigating measures. Notwithstanding the player inability to pass level two, the game was played more than once. Obviously it was necessary to make huge investment in knowledge. The information gained guided the player on the level of investment that was needed for insurance and protection. Additionally, it was not wise to buy insurance immediately after a disaster, since the emphasis should be on recovery and development. The game though realistic will be better if it replicates prevalent risks such as hurricane, flooding, drought, financial crisis among others. The frequency of the risk must be realistic also as well as the application of the mitigating measures. I proposed therefore, that amendmentsÂ  should focus mainly on risks that are common in developing countries since they are more vulnerable and have a lower level of risk management.

The level of averagedamage was about 40% which is 740$. Construction of a pod was 10 seconds andrepair time of a pod approximately 8 seconds so, if we assume in a random gametwo successive hits with damage the minimum required time to complete themission is 2* 10sec/pod * 5pod + 5pod* 8sec/pod = 150 Â secondsÂ which is the duration of the game. Thecost of protection in terms of money is relatively low 1$/sec. and 16 secondsto achieve 10 % of protection which means a slow response.This knowledge has led to the following conclusions:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The insurance is essentialand since the cost of it is acceptable it is worth to buy the best insurance possible(75%) Â and keep a budget reserve of 175$and to repair damages as fast as possible in case of a meteor hit. This actioncan be started after the first two pods are built.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â In order to complete theconstruction of the pods as soon as possible a large initial budget isnecessary so it would be better to wait for some time and then start thebuilding task.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The preparation for riskinclude: research and protection as I mentioned before these are mostly timeconsuming activities the time should be split between them. How to divide the timebetween these two will depend upon the severity of the specific threat. Because the response of the protection system is relatively slow and thecost is acceptable it is preferable to activate the protection system while thebudget is accumulated and then to initiate the development process since theycan work in parallel.2 I have played the game several times, the first were intuitive and ittook me several attempts to move to the second level.

Initially, I thought Insurance was all I needed to secure the future of the community. However, the cost involved due to damage seemed to be poorly spent and was not the best way to mitigate risk. Later I realized that Knowledge (research, probability, impact) and preparation allowed me to make better choices with respect to damage control and repair. Which gave me a better since of the type of insurance was best to protect the community. I found that managing growth while constantly preparing for the next catastrophe was a daunting task. These were many takeoffs that had the be considered while managing risks. For instance, before a catastrophic event, preparation had to be made to make sure necessary elevation was applied, which delayed the repair of already damaged pods, This also slowed growth and development of new pods. Value of pods, cost and insurance and probability of risk, all had to be considered at the same time in order to make the most cost effective decision, while focusing on the heath and growth of the community.What I learn from the game lead me to consider my community, and the areas that are most vulnerable to risk. I live in a coastal area which is vulnerable to hurricanes. Each year we (citizens) are given a report, based on ""research"", about the probability of a direct hit from a severe storm. This notice is also reviewed by insurance companies, who will determine the rate of insurance you will pay of the upcoming your, or, if your insurance policy will be reinstated at all, For the past five years we (citizens) have been warned of a major storm and each year insurance rates have increased or policies have been cancelled all together. The reason for the increase, insurance companies estimate the repair cost from damage due to hurricane will far exceed the value of the policy. This has caused a major problem for those who have a mortgage that require homeowners insurance. As a result the government has stepped in to provide State Owned Insurance, This insurance is sometimes two or three times the cost of traditional insurance, and with no other options we (citizens) have to pay. Needless to say, there have been Zero storms to hit this region in the past ten years. This game in a way put my situation in perspective.

Â The situation was not static: the availability of funds, the location of the comet, or the severity wasalways changing.By my third game, in order to cope with damage caused by a hit, I alwayspurchased insurance.Â  This helpedgreatly as the cost to repair a pod was extremely high without insurance.Â  IÂ also had to balance developmentwith the uncertainty of a shock because a developed pod cost more to repair -even with insurance.Â I also noted that the game had a bias towards research.Â  Protection was costly, raising thecommunity was not necessarily encouraged; it cost you to raise the island whileyou gained income from researching.Â  So, I started to research comets as they appeared and focused less on raising the island. Â I sacrificed protection for research. Â Access to credit would've provided funds to do both. Â In New Jersey, many of the people who suffered from Hurricane Sandy did not have insurance before the disaster or access to credit after the disaster, severely impacting their ability to recover.One change that I would make to the game is the ability to apply for credit. Â Access to funds would've changed the outcome for me on several occasions. Â Credit would've permitted me to focus more on protection. Â The game penalized me for focusing on protection, costing me both money and time.The game showed me obstacles to risk management: uncertainty and limited access to monetary resources. Â It taught me the importance of balancing research with protection costs. Â Research is important but funds are necessary to implement your research findings. Â Funds are also necessary to respond to and prepare for catastrophic shocks that affect more than 50% of your resources.Â "89.43.157.56,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,30.0 to 33.0,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"For the first two-three attempts I concentrated more on protection and insurance, and I did not take the risk of developing the city.

The main role was to show the importance of information, protection, insurance and coping. The aspect of knowledge is captured by the research that could be improved. The main element to use as information is the severity of the comet. The chance of impact is less important. The risk changes so chances are, that you fail to anticipate all the comets. Playing the game more often however was necessary to improve the knowledge of the risks and payoffs. So experience leads to more information and better informed decisions. There is a tradeoff between buying insurance, protection and production capacity. Only with adequate protection is it possible to maintain a certain level of productivity, meaning that opportunities can only be seized, when risk is managed.  However, as the costs are not always clear, it is difficult to see what choices are most efficient.In this trade off, my focus was on protection. If protection was in place, there was no need for insurance, although there still would be some damage, even if protection was adequate. Insurance was useful in the beginning, when in some cases there was lack of time to build up protection. Once protection is up, the focus lies on building production capacity. Little could be done with research, or coping. 2. I played the game more than once. The first thing I changed was to buy protection immediately, instead of buying productive assets. My failure to understand the risk properly led me to focus on the wrong  things: eg productivity, instead of protection. In one case I lost quite a lot. Once protection is in place, it is possible to sustain this level of protection and to start building the community. Moreover there is a higher probability to recover in case protection is bought early in the game. If  protection is bought at a later stage, it is impossible to return to the green signal. However, the reason is not always clear. Is this because of too much protection, or too little productive assets..3. Improve the community building or coping function and make the costs and benefits more explicit. If it is possible to recover better: eg, the cost of repair would be less, the trade off between coping, protection and insurance and productivity would be become more explicit. In the version that is now working it is not possible to see what pays off most. Eg: How much can I earn with productive assets and how much can I loose. What are repair costs if I cope and how much if I insure. These choices are not very explicit.  Another improvement could be related to the function of risk management. Some risks can only be solved using insurance (when there is no protection (perhaps this would be the largest comet, but I did not see one), other risks are better tackled using protection. This element is function is absent. "14.139.235.161,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The simulation game of world of Alora was no less than a realtime scenario where the community of Alora had to be saved from calamities byusing various precautionary measures or by taking corrective actions at theright time.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Developmentof the community is done by making buildings or by continuous up gradation ofthe pods made.

The assignment was to protect the fords from the comet rain. In order to be effective on that, we had multiple tools but they had to be used efficiently. The amount invested on research and thus the knowledge about the comet had a negative relationship with the magnitude of the damage caused. Additionally, there were 3 options about insurance for the fords. The higher the percentage the easier was to repair the fords. Finally, the more upgraded the fords were, the less damage they suffer. The lever of preparation was crucial in order to avoid a potential hit or to minimize the damages caused.Â In my firs attempt to the game, I failed the first level. This was mainly due to the fact that my concentration was more towards creating multiple fords rather that upgrade and protect the existing ones. Also, by the moment I realized what I have to do, there was no time left. The second time I played the game, i followed a different strategy. I decided to built the fords at the inner part of the planet as far away as possible from the comet rain. Additionally, I tried to upgrade them as soon as possible and I also increased the insurance from 50 to 75%. By doing this, the recovery amount of money was lower. Finally, i invested as much as possible on knowledge and this was effective since the more research i made the less likely was the comet to hit the planet, and also it reduced the magnitude of the impact. Overall, the more ready I was, the less damages i had to face.Â In real rife, there are also choices that need to be made in terms of risk management. For instance, residencies near the sea suffer from floods and damages whenever the sea level exceed the normal. This can be prevented by adding extra measures such as built-up walls or try to understand when the next incidence will be. Risk management is applied in every day life situations because from previous experience we know that the more prepared we are, the less damage we will sufferÂ "88.196.104.119,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"How much one can invest into development, protection and insurance?

It is the diversion from the expected. For anyone to effectively manage it, there has to be a trade-off between protection, research and insurance. None of these methods can work in isolation. All risks have to be researched and identified and then prioritized according to the probability of occurrence and severity of impact. Preparation of risk affected development in that I could not start managing risk before starting any development as there is no risk. However, after development, I spread out my developments so that there is no systematic risk as well as put up few developments that I could sufficiently cover using the insurance. However, for the developments that were hit and damaged, it required additional resources to restore them to the position there were in before. This also affected the level of protection to the whole development. Where there was damage to the pods, the protection that I had accumulated reduced making the developments more vulnerable even after putting in resources to protect them. However, there more developments I put up, the better it was to cope with the risks as the cluster would enable collective coping mechanism to any risk encountered.I played the game more than once and therefore I was able to learn that there needs to be a tradeoff between knowledge, protection and insurance for effective risk management. Moreover, for each aspect of risk management, I need to have adequate resources not only for development, but also for employment of effective risk management strategies. Moreover, different risks have to be handled differently as they come with different levels of impact and severity. Prioritization has to be done so as not to concentrate resources on a risk that although had a high level of severity, the probability of occurrence was very low while putting little effort in management of a risk whose level of severity was low but the probability of occurrence was very high.I would change management of risk through protection. In the game, the level of protection can only be increased but not reduced by an individual. This is because, in cases here there is no need of a lot of protection, and resources can be diverted from there to insurance or knowledge. This is so that, there are no resources that are underutilized which could have been properly utilized to manage the risks."74.88.80.178,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"I played the game 8 times and each time I got a little better but still could never win level 5.It seemed like each level of the game had a certain variable that was it's focus and effected your score the most if you increased your use of it. It seemed knowledge was the best way to increase your amount of monetary reserves and at the same time saving further development of the pods until there were only low risk comets in the atmosphere. Also you should not over buy insurance. At the lower levels it seemed you only needed the second level of insurance until the higher risk comets came and you developed your pods more then you needed the third level of insurance. I think that one issue that the game did not capture and an issue I have frequently confronted when I have been involved in risk management decisions in the New York City area is that certain areas and certain populations are more vulnerable to natural disasters than others and often when you only have a certain amount of money to allocate to all areas of the City you need to prioritize.Generally, the low lying areas (more prone to flooding) and also the poor, elderly or disabled are where resources are most needed. I think the game treated all the developments as though they all had the same risk even though some were closer to the water's edge than others and in that instance you might expect those properties to be more vulnerable.You also need to somehow be able to evaluate which actions will have the most impact and that may have been what was missing in the game. For instance, if had taken my pods to the next level of development as soon as I had enough money, would that have sped my rate of return on my investment and then maybe I would have been able to be better protected? Or if I had distributed flyers to all the residents of Allora about how to prepare for disasters (preparation at their own expense to some extent) and where to evacuate to in the event a disaster hits should that have raised to score as well? Communication is often an inexpensive form of risk mitigation that cities can undertake and I think it would have been helpful if the game focused on that aspect a little more. For instance, many neighborhoods and cities in the New York region have distributed flyers that describe what type of things people need to have on hand in order to be prepared for a natural disaster and also communicated the cities' central emergency centers' locations and where to register with the fire department in the event you need assistance in evacuation which the fire department has said has been an enormous help. Overall I think it was helpful in getting the general concepts of risk management across (preparation, protection and insurance) but I would have like to have seen the repercussions of my decisions in more detail and more clearly. I think the ideas relating to prioritization and communication in relation to risk management would have been helpful to see in more detail."98.203.226.59,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in this game was to provide a framework for decision-making in the context of insurance choices, limited funds to spend on protection options, and the ever-changing information available to base decisions on. Â Balancing the options and choices based on researching the comet severity and probability of damage was the core skill to be developed by a player. Â Development of the housing on the island was needed in order to accumulate funds, so spending on houses was a requirement. Â But just building with no additional measures was doomed to failure.This is because comet strikes would destroy the housing and waste a high percentage of the money invested. Â By holding back on the housing development and buying one of the three levels of insurance, one could recover faster from any damage to those developments and expand later.In addition, one could research comets as they entered the picture and develop a general sense of the probability of a strike and the degree of damage severity expected from that strike. Â Even if the research was only approximate, it did provide some information to base decisions on, such as to raise the island temporarily or buy more insurance in the future. Â All choices involved trade-offs: raising the island cost money, buying more expensive insurance cost more money, improving the housing structures with upgrades cost money, but not all comets were worth the costly preparations. Â Not building or doing any protection at all were choices in themselves, but led to poor results (uncompensated disaster and loss).This led me after playing the first time to more seriously consider insurance at the highest level, even if this later seemed extreme and unnecessary for some comet strikes. Â I learned very quickly that building too much at the beginning was probably not needed and that a slow development was better, because I was able to spend funds on insurance protection, upgrades to building, and raising the island.In addition, I learned that raising the island was not very effective in protecting from damage. Â Further, it was unclear that the occasionally lighted-up buildings, which then could be linked in ""community"" protection,"" contributed much to protection. Â These weaknesses are built-in settings to the game and must reflect the assumptions that insurance is better, researching is important (even if incomplete information), and that other forms are of lesser effectiveness.One additional feature I would add if redesigning the game would be to represent material damages versus people damages. Â People are more important than buildings and development, yet they somehow do not show up in the game.

As trade-offs interms of knowledge, protection, and insurance I have the time and the money. Therisk manager needs time to research, to protect and to insure. This time is toshort. The speed and frequency of events that produced shocks on the communityand damage development is very high. In another hand he needs money to makeresearches on the risk, protect the community and insure de development investisment(infrastructures, houses, equipments, and so one). This money is not alwaysavailable. So the manager needs to calculate every time.Preparation for risk affects development becauseit reduces the intensity of shocks and damages, help people or the community torepair damages and to recovery development after shocks. It also reduces decost of the reconstruction. After some time preparation make total control ofthe risk.I played the game more than once. It took meabout 12 hours to won the first level. I won level 2 and lost level three. Thefirst line up I use was: protection (building plot), research information aboutcomet coming, buying insurance and protection. After shock, I use to repairdamages, get informationâ€™s about de next comet, try to invest (build development).First : The that risk management is a verycomplex task because the manager has to be intelligent, prompt to react. Everytime his is searching informationâ€™s about risk, securing investisment, searchingmoney and man power. Second: there is the â€œincertitudeâ€ù of some risk. Duringthe game although research indicates that the comet is going to cause severitydamages the comet missed. Before the missed, the manager has invested in thesecurity (protection and insurance). Third : if the risk manager failed he isgoing to lost all the investisment. For example I reach three time level 2.When I failed at level 3 I have to restate the game at level 1. So risk managerhave to take care every time to make sure that investisment are well secured. Fourth:the risk manager has to be very sensible. In game there is a signal when cometare coming then another when is going to heat. If the risk manager does notdetect the signal he cannot secure the community. Five: there is a difference betweenthe theory and the practice of risk management. In practice the risk managerhave a short time to do a lot of work. He need collaborators. This game is very instructive. If there is somethingto add it may be a bank.

In preparation for the game â€œRisk Horizon,â€ù I first took thegameâ€™s tutorial, which gave me limited understanding of theprocess. I just started playing. I got to Level 2â€”losing Level 3. Had to startover at Level 1 Â (discouraging). I had lostLevel 1 three times before advancing to Level 2. I continued playing with astrategy more focused on more developments (Pods). I also placedthe developments in a place far from the waterâ€™s edge! That didnâ€™t work. Therewas still water around that particular development (forgot water will take overland no matter how far inland it goes).I purchasedinsurance each round I played. Initially, I chose insurance in the middle andlater purchase the highest; I really donâ€™t know if it made a difference; I wastoo focused on how much money I had for repairs. One round of play, I clickedon 2-additional developments and lost Level 3. Inreflecting on the game; and as I connected it to this weekâ€™s core reading (pp.53-75), I found that the game was challenging â€“ for a novice; a by chance(choose to pick the right Pods to protect). While in the confines of playingthe game, I realized that I did have enough data available and usableinformation to advance to Level 5. I couldnâ€™t process the game as one unit. I keptmy focus on the comets that I couldnâ€™t control and not on the parts that Icould.In our corereading, being â€œProactive risk management can help prevent or lessen damagesâ€ù (p.57).Or, â€œâ€_by moving people away from the areas likely to be more affected andpreparing buildings and infrastructure in advanceâ€ù (p.58).If I havethe opportunity to change one thing in the game, I would not have the playersstart over again if he/she lost Level 2.

Iâ€™m glad I took the opportunity to play bychallenging myself to-do something new. FINALLY early Saturday morning (7/12/2014)coffee close by, I reached Level 5 by developing all the Pods that the landwould take; and upgrading them 3 at-a time.

When I was faced with risks with an higher severity and chance of hitting, I was more inclined to buy an insurance with an higher coverage and the other way around. When I was faced with the possibility of a hit that would cause great damage, I was more inclined to invest more money in protection and the other way around. Research definitely turned out to be useful in many cases.2) Playing the game once, I was inclined to take more risky decisions, as I was not sure yet what the effect of these decisions would be. The first time I played the game more with an trial and error approach than with a strategic plan. Once I played the game more often, I learned that sometimes it was better to take less risky decisions in order to progress further in the game. Therefore, I invested more money in protection, research and insurance in the latter times that I played the game. The second time that I played however, I was scared and took no risk at all. Playing the game more often allowed me to find a balance between taking risks versus taking no risks at all, making something similar to a cost-benefit analysis in my head (including the evaluation of chance of a hit, the severity of a hit, the effect that a hit would have, the cost and benefit of insurance, research and protection)3) In a new version of the game I would develop a function in which you are able to invest in research that allows you to optimize your protection methods. For example, investing an certain amount of time and money in research creates the opportunity to employ a new level of protection that would protect you more from a hot, leading to lesser damage. This creates a trade-off between investing in research and investing in insurance, as at some point research can become so advance that risk of the hit becomes irrelevant and insurance becomes unnecessary."134.121.114.15,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â Â The role of risk management within the game wasto demonstrate how risks effect developing communities and how the componentsof effective risk management, preparation and coping, are used together. Ichose to buy the mid-grade insurance and spent a lot of time on researching themeteors, but this meant less time was spent on the actual development of mycommunity. This effected my community because there was not enough developmentdone to the community to pass to the next level, even though what was there washealthy and safe. Developing is a key aspect of this game that can be missed ifthe focus is on other things, like research or gaining protection. Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â I played the game a total of 3 attempts andstuck with a similar strategy each time of focusing on gaining knowledge andslowly developing the community with moderate insurance and protection. Ofcourse this strategy didnâ€™t get me pass the second level and changes to thisstrategy obviously should be made. If I were able to come up with more time totry more attempts at the game I would change my strategy to a more balanced approached.This would make my focus more equal on my preparation strategies and the developmentof my community. I realized, if I were to pass into more levels, more researchcan be done with more time, and not all research needs to happen right away soother aspects of risk management can gain some priority. Not only do you haveto have all the aspects of risk management, gaining knowledge, protection, andinsurance but you must find the right balance between all of the also so therisk management actually becomes effective. 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â I personally valued knowledge more than gainingprotection and insurance but I felt, in this version of the game, more of abalance was desired. My theory was in taking a less developed community andgiving them more preparation with more knowledge that can then be used tocontinue to develop a stronger community in the future. If I were to add anaspect of the game I would have made the structures built better initially orwhen repaired as my knowledge increased. That way each new building or repairedbuilding gained a better structure as my knowledge increased regarding themeteors and how they cause damage. For me, it made more sense to increaseeffective risk management strategies first before the community continued todevelop so stronger development was made in the future.

I played the game twice and there were different strategies that were adopted. In my first attempt, the main aim was to build the communities as quickly as possible. I thought that having more communities would help in agility, cooperation and sharing of resources when comets struck the planet. But at the same time, I bought the insurance that offered the least protection, because the first comet that came near had a low probability of hitting. But the strategy back-fired in the second level of the game because I had spread my resources too thin by starting too many cells and had to incur high damage costs for each of the communities because of low insurance. This caused the failure to move from Level 2 to Level 3. While developmental activity was on, the damages caused the future potential of development because significant resources were spent on repairs and damages and the threat of another comet ruining the new developmental activities did not encourage any new developments. As a result the Level 2 failure could be blamed on inadequate planning, preparations for comet strikes and spreading the resources too thin. The second attempt involved ploughing back the learning from the first attempt. This time, the game was played with a phase-wise expansion of communities and taking the highest insurance available. Also, the elevation option was exercised, which had been ignored in the earlier attempt. All this helped in crossing the second level, but the third level again caused problems to the developmental activities. Also, the comets were regularly monitored to check for the probability of strike and preparations were made accordingly. The main learning from the game were that insurance would help mitigate the damage that is caused because of risks that are uncertain and are beyond the control. The lower damage costs would save the resources that could be exploited for better opportunities. Apart from this, proper planning and preparedness helps build resilience, which otherwise could cause chaos. Communities that can share resources and cooperate have an edge at surviving calamities. In the game, it was observed that the comets struck at the same intervals and at the same intensity when the game was played twice. If given a task to recreate the game, I would design it in a manner that would make the sequence and the intensity of the comets striking a random event, so that the uncertainty in the game can be maintained."124.191.140.232,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,-36.0 to 1.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,11.0 to 46.0,"The role of risk management was to protect your buildings whilst ensuring that you spent enough money of upgrades in order to meet your quota. I knew that there was a chance that I would get hit by comets but I had to weight that up with the fact that I couldn't spend all my money of defense. After some time I developed a strategy which I though incorporated the best of both worlds.Â After playing the game more than once, I realised that it was more effective for me to raise my buildings instead of purchasing insurance. The reason for this is because the raised building lasts for more than one round where are the insurance you have to buy every round and the raised building did not include a time delay after the comet hit.Â One thing that I would change would be to hae an extra option to shoot the comets out of the air before they got the opportunity to hit you.

This taught me important lesson about identification ofvarious risks that you are exposed to, research and preparation towardsminimizing those risk. I would recommend that upgrade should include ways of generating, growing and maintaining wealth since wealth is crucial in preparing for risk and coping with a disaster as well. The level on the game should reflect the number of risk a village is exposed to with varying modes of impact. This will promote prioritization, commitment to a cause of action or inaction."111.87.58.101,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,30.0 to 33.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"In the beginning I thought that this game was very easy after I did the tutorial, but when I understood its complexity when reaching higher levels, I understood that the role is to create and improve as well as protect in order to be rewarded with more resources.

I realised that for each level, there was a requirement to balance the resources given along with protection needed and insurance. I also realised that buying more protection or developing the pods too quickly also did not fill my meter quick enough.Â After I failed the first time, I started the game by buying insurance and protecting the land at least to 4 bars as minimum, I realised it is better to start with ensuring safety then continue to build and develop the pods.Â If I had the opportunity to change or add something to the game, I would add that as we increase our levels, to buy research bars for comets that pass quickly by.

Its role can be outlined asbelow:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To ensure long-term survival of the community ofAloraÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To provide immediate protection and relief fromshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insuranceÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To ensure timely and justified protection at thetime of crisisÂ Important choices had to be made for each crisis accordingto its severity. Due to limited resources, it wasimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimumutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching theisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basisof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance ofa hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I wouldimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gatherknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal insafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, beingcomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making atrade-off between risk and resources, I wasable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.While making preparations for the shock, again atrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due tolimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted sothat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would notupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buyinsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on developmentdue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain moreresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resourceswas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoidedby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of developmentslowed down the process of growth of resources.Â Having played the game more than once, I learnt certainvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.Initially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize therisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized thatdevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick paceto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary toprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, Ibegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordinglyspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community againstthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive thebarrage of incoming comets. This game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-worldcrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of timemanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct andjustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.Â Hailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize thatcorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequatesocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in riskmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a justand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice toall citizens of the community.Â "77.173.71.174,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Several ways to calculate a risk.- Most common is calculating the amount of events.

The randomness of the events and the amount of damage made calculation difficult. Trade-offs between research, protection, communication and development requires routine. It is difficult to make estimations in such a short time. In reflection to question 2: After playing the game several times, I used multiple ""scenarios"". Using different settings I gained knowledge and using this I reached level two. Calculated experiments gave useful information to reach any level faster.For example: - by putting most effort in research  development. Gaining more time.- changing insurance whenever the high risk meteor comes by.- Using the button to increase protection.All these efforts gave insight. And made possible to mix  match during the development of the village.In reflection to question 3: One of the reforms would be a possibility to invest in protection measures.

We know that risk management includes both preparing for risk as well as coping with the consequences of it. In the game we had the choice of buying insurance which was supposed to help deal with the consequences of the disaster (in this case the meteor shower), as well as the raising of the floor level, which was supposed to help with preparation for the said risk. In this sense we had been provided with tools to manage risk by preparing in advance and coping with damage after disaster struck. The last element of risk management is collaboration at the community and other levels to deal with contingency, risk mitigation and coping mechanisms. This was also provided as a tool in the form of 'making connections' in the game. These three elements/tools were packaged with 'research', which was essentially the use of experience and forecasting to predict the occurrence of the disaster to improve preparedness and maintain control of the situation. I found that knowing the level of severity in advance allowed me to decide by how much I needed to raise the floor level. This element also mimicked real life quite well because information about the meteor shower got more accurate with time, which is true of all disaster forecasting. This created a very real and immediate trade-off between the amount of time I could spend researching the meteor and the amount of time I could spend between doing other things like raising the floor level for disaster preparation, building more assets (pods) and upgrading existing pods to increase wealth. What I learned over time was how to improve the balance between the time and energy I could allot to each of these things. I also understood the importance of renewing insurance over time and making internal connections. If I was developing the game and was allowed to make a change, then I would probably introduce an 'investment tool' where I could invest in either better researching technology or better and more expensive pods. That would bring out the trade-out between wealth generation and protections more vividly."24.212.22.110,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management is obviously the main point in this game,the goal being to achieve balance between getting knowledge of the risks beinghit by a meteor, preparing to reduce possible losses, getting insurance to helpget back on our feet and coping (repairing and start back development) whenhit, while continuing to improve development. I started by making choices thathindered Aloraâ€™s development by wanting to overprotect, which resulted infailing to develop and being trapped at level one. Then I took more risks withlower-impact meteors and spent more in development, while getting basic insuranceat the beginning of each level. I realized that while waiting for income toraise, it was better to at least spend some time researching the incomingmeteors and, when there was none, getting some protection by raising the levelof the ground. Starting to raise little by little since the beginning helped inthe long run, when more severe impacts happened; having a good base, it waspossible to increment the protection only when a severe impact was imminent. Itwas also typically possible to cope (repair) more easily by accepting somedamage after having spent a little in insurance, a little in protectionandÂ  a good amount of time researching toallow good community connections; the mix of strategies was more efficientwhile allowing to spend more in development.The basic lessons I learned from the game that to me applyto life are to adopt a mix of strategies; to start preparing early; to neverstay idle (if nothing can be constructed, do some research!); and not tounderestimate the importance of social connections. The game seems to be made to foster equity; it seemed towork better when all the first-level pods were built, then all upgraded alittle, then again a little. Life is unfortunately not so equitable at themoment. A harder version of the game could be made where the player starts withsome construction already advanced, others basic, others in ruin. And not a lotof money. Another version could then, maybe include different development criteria (two barsthat measure different things, maybe green spaces and urban development?) to beattained since everyone in life does not have the same criteria for a living. Finally, I'm not sure I understood how the concept of seizing opportunities was included in the game. Could there be something like a falling star going through that you can catch if you're not doing anything at that same moment?While I only got to level 5 and do not know what happensnext, I also find interesting that the type of development pictured in the gameseems basically to be the typical capital-intensive-growth-forever we have indeveloped countries.

Either research on the cometâ€™sseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as researchtime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take actionto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,it can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level ofprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect theplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance anddevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching ahigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In thebeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and usingthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase infinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way thatit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance andprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actuallylessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances ofhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet throughobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according tothe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not causetoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protectAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role inreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one hasto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower thecosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on thephysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutivetime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better thatis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I wouldpropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to thecontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relativelyfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given thissituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions withlimited and slower growing financial resources."157.193.226.115,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"In the game, risk management was crucial in order to win, because if we did not prepare for and cope with the effects of the comets it was impossible to reach the end goal in time. We had to share our resources (time and money) between building/upgrading and three types of risk management.The first, Insurance, allows us to transfer resources over to a time of need (after the strike of a comet). In the game, it wouldÂ make the costs from comet damage lower, which was good, butÂ it meant that we still had to repair the buildings after the shock (which consumed time and money).Â Knowledge, on the other hand, means getting information and then using that information to reduce the uncertainty involving the event. In the game it improved the ability of the player to deal with the situation while it was happening, butÂ for very strong comets it was hard to avoid all damage. Finally,Â Protection measures reduce the impact of a shock, which in the game meant reducing the damage to the buildings (sometimes to zero).The limited amount of money and time meant that we had to focus our efforts in mostly one of these options.Â My first strategy was to only spend money in development (no risk management), but this only worked in the short-term: as soon as comets started hitting the planet the development would go down too much and I was not able to win the level. My second strategy was to buy the most expensive insurance there was right at the beginning of the level, but this meant I had to wait a long time to start development and then was not able to reach the required level. Finally, I decided to focus on the development but as soon as I saw a comet I would research it and try to make the protection level of the planet match the damage it would do (to avoid any damage to the buildings), and so after a comet hit I was able to continue development normally (no damage was done). This was the strategy that allowed me to reach level 5.This game was an interesting way to see the impact of preparation and coping mechanisms when dealing with disasters, and it taught me to think about preparing better for the possibility of loss in my own life.Â I experienced that if Protection is used without first having some Knowledge, we run the risk of investing too much or too little before a given catastrophe, thereby using our resources inefficiently, and this is the case in reality as well (we should always gain knowledge before deciding which protection measures to use). Â Furthermore, the game showed how risk management is cost effective, just as explained in class, but it also requires us to have a significant amount of money upfront, which is probably the main reason why poorer countries take less risk preparation measures in general. Finally, it allowed the player to face a crucial dilemma in risk management: should I invest now in preparation or save my resources to cope later with the aftermath of the disaster?To improve the game, I would propose that the costs associated with insurance, protection and research would be proportional to the number of buildings and their stage of development, because in most real life scenarios these costs rise when you have more assets to insure/protect."183.178.67.45,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"Therole of risk management in this game is to balance my development withprotecting it against comets. While the scope and levels of pod constructionshas to be maximized within limited wealth and time, I have to minimizetheÂ lossÂ brought by the comets via prediction of severity and chanceof hit (knowledge), raising the bars to reduce damageÂ (protection) andpurchase of insurance, which is to reduce the repairmen cost, and replenishsome of any development. Ialways purchased the level 1 and/or level 2 insurance at the very beginning ofeach level, which reduced my capital for development. Also, after everychecking the severity of the comet, I spent plenty of time raising the bar toalign with the severity level, which halted the development and reduced capitalfor other actions. The only aspect I did not do much for preparation for riskis knowledge. I only clicked on every comet once or at most twice, because IthoughtÂ the prediction (knowledge of the risk)Â was not quiteimportant. Therefore, very often I spent a lot of timeÂ andcapitalÂ protecting the village against the comets that were missed. Thisalso reduced the allowedÂ time for community connections after the hit. Damageincreased owing to this. Iam quite satisfied with attaining level 4. However, if I had another chance, Iwould buy a higher level of insurance, and spend more time on research, so asto reduce the time and wealth used to raise the bars (protection). The higherlevel insurance would help me to recover sooner within limited resources andreplenish the losses at a greater extent. With more research, I would not spendany time that has very little chance to hit, but more building and upgradingthe pods. With limited wealth and time, the crux of the matter is to balancethe extent of knowledge, protection, and insurance for managing and coping withthe risk. IfI could modify the game, I would add the symbol to represent the internationalfinancial aid, for players to click on after the hit. Not only the financialaid scale adjusts with the extent of damage,Â it shrinks in scale acrosseach level to demonstrate the realistic situation that international donationwill diminish with the increased frequency of natural disasters, as peoplebecome more apathetic towards frequent tragedies. Not only this modificationhelps simulate the realistic situation more thoroughly, it also inspires usersto re-contemplate the unsustainability brought by behavioural dependence oninternational aid, as found in many developing countries.

Depending my income andthe threat, I had to consider how my city will performs better in order toreach a high development despite the risks that surrender me, especiallydangerous and evil Â comets.For instance,if comets threat was kind of low, I was able to chase a better protection whileupgrading my plots. If threats were high or dangerous and I couldnÂ´t stop themwith more protection, I had to focus in insurance and research for a better performanceafter the hit.Preparationfor risk is a key figure in progress as if you forget , it can make a flatgrowth for a long time, and stagnation can kill a new born or low income city,making impossible for them to protect ad progress for the next years.I played itdifferent times and I must say that first time I did it quiet bad, as I forgot completelyabout the research, so sometimes it happened that I didnÂ´t had time enough tocreate community connections so It was a such a great disaster!! After that, I choseto take always a big care about research and protection, and insurance justwhen the threat was a very high danger.I tried tokeep my protection index always higher that the threat, upgrading plots alwaysthat I had cash and keeping a steady and unstoppable progress ;)One thingthat I will improve for this game is to erase the ""severity"" ofcomets hits, as itÂ´s something very unreal because in the real life you Â are not able to predict how big is gonna bethis threat. Doing so, as in the game, youÂ´re able to play always with acertain risk, and can manage much better your city, disregarding littlethreats. If I wasnÂ´t able to know this severity, I would be much morepreoccupied in protect and insure my population that knowing ""itÂ´s not abig threat so I can keep living as I am for now"".This neverhappen in real world with an earthquake or a tsunami, donÂ´t taking into accountone of the key reasons for people usually doesnÂ´t worry about risks.Anyway itÂ´sa cool game to introduce newbies in risk management, no doubt."41.161.57.200,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"Role of risk management in the game:The gamehas two underlying risks which have to be managed simultaneously. The risk ofthe city being flooded due to the comet impacting the water, and the risk thatthe required city development is not reached. TheÂ aim was to manage city growthvs city protection.Choices made and trade-offs confronted:Choices hadto be made regarding the allocation of funds and time towards constructingbuildings, choosing insurance, increasing city protection and increasing comet research.The main tradeoffswere as follows:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Increasingconstruction would decrease available funds, and it would temporarily stop developmentat the factory, however after construction the development from the factorywould be increased;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Increasedinsurance would decrease the potential loss should a comet strike, whiledecreasing available funds for other uses;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Increasedcity protection improves the probability that the city can successfully defendagainst comets with a higher severity, while decreasing available funds forother uses and stopping the development from all factories during the time thatprotection is being increasedÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Increasedresearch assists with identifying the most threatening comets with the highestchance of hitting, as well as increasing the time available to the city todefend against potential floods, however it is only possible to research onecomet at a time and the city protection cannot be increased while a comet isbeing researchedEffect of risk management on development:Ineffectiverisk management would lead to a flood which would immediately reduce development.Increased factorydevelopment would immediately halt all development at the one factory. Increasedcity protection would immediately halt development at all factories.Increased researchwould decrease the time available to increase factory development. Increasedinsurance would not effect development immediately, but it would decrease thefunds available to increase development in the future.What changed after playing the game the firsttime and what were the main things learnt:The mainchange was that I used research to more effectively allocate the available timeto comets that posed the greatest threat to the city, based on the severity andchance of hitting. This then also increased the time available to defendagainst the comet once it had hit. Proposed game changes:The waterlevel could rise continuously due to the effects of global warming. More â€˜greenâ€™factories could be constructed to slow the rise in the water level."81.229.76.216,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"1. Risk management played a crucial role in the game, without it there would have been a walk in the park. Since risk was such a constant threat, I had to make different choices and trade-offs in order to be able to reach the next level. The things that I prioritised was insurance and protection. I felt that in order for my community to be able to survive possible threats, protection (because it minimised the damage) and insurance (because it minimised the cost even more if damage would occur) was the best way to go.2. I played the game only once. If I had played it more times, I would probably focused more on research. That would have helped me to know during which periods to focus the spending on insurance and protection, and during which periods to focus the spending on improving the community through upgrading the houses. The main thing that I learned from this game, is that it is nothing that is right or wrong and that it is a constant trade-off between what should be prioritised.3. I think that an improvement of the game would be if there were more than one kind of threat and more than one kind of damage. People in poor countries of face threats such as regarding their economy, their food intake, their house, and their personal and national security. And the damages done by these different kind of threats can be vey different, ranging from starvation and poor health to political and national unrest.

The trade-off I was faced with was a cost of insurance cover and protection. The protection seemed much more expensive then the insurance cover but in case of high severity impacts both forms of protection were needed to prevent damage to the pods and reduce the cost of rebuilding them. Protection efforts had a direct impact on the speed of development - more protection meant fewer pods. In case of higher insurance cover the number of podsÂ  built or upgraded was decreased, which consequently had a knock-on effect on the speed of earning money. However, without insurance cover the costs of rebuilding the pots wouldâ€™ve been much higher.If I were to play the game again, I would pay more attention to the probability of the hit. My main attention was on the severity and preparation levels needed rather then a probability, which sometimes resulted in me being overprotective and slowing down speed of the development.The main things I learned from this game were:the need to balance out development  growth while having in place an adequate risk management program,the need to be realistic about probability of risk (not to under or overestimate the risk).Â If I were to introduce a change to this game I would like to add a social response to the thread of comets damaging pods. I think many of us are easily influenced by others when it comes to making decisions. It would be good to see if the person playing the game would make correct risk management decisions when faced with different levels of concern about the forthcoming threads coming from the pods. This new addition would require that the player not only estimates the possible risk and chooses the right level of protection and preparation but also listens or ignores the comments coming from the community depending on the circumstances (based onÂ research only available to the player). This new addition would give the player a chance toÂ develop a better sense of what risk management feels like in a more complex environment, and how community views (based on personal views, beliefs ...) are not necessarily to be trusted.Â "124.123.230.43,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"Risk management is the key motive of the game. We had to make a choice between protection, insurance, timing of development and at the same time keeping track of the cost of implementing these measures compared to the loss. We also need to make a choice of researching on the risk and gaining knowledge. The trade-offs confronted are mainly â€“Â 1.	Invest time on research or invest it in implementation of protection measures2.	Choice of insurance based on the costs and the chances and magnitude of loss3.	Timing of development â€“ develop or save money to cover losses4.	Protect by increasing height immediately or wait until considerable amount of research and implement the protection5.	Most important of all, trade-off between money and protection/insurance measuresImmediate effect of preparation of risk on development would be due to the usage of money. Some amount had to be kept aside for insurance, protection and for measures in case of loss which would have been used for development. In long run, this protection and insurance would have saved us money which could be used for development.The best strategy would be to choose optimal level of insurance, optimal height level and to spend time on research. Increasing the height would have a long term implication and a height of level 5 seemed to be optimal. With the increase in probability and intensity of risk, the development would slow down as there needs to be enough buffer amount in case of loss to get back to normal life. Spending time on research should be of high priority and would really help in saving cost of protection.I would like to add the factors like the cost of natural resources being used and cost of power in case of protection. The region I live in is currently facing shortage of electricity, clean drinking water, more usage of non-renewable resources and less of renewable resources and pollution. I believe these are the major risks in the world today and especially in developing countries.

The role of Risk Managementin this game shows that risk and opportunity go hand in hand.Thechoice I made in the game is to spend all my money on either building the Podsor preparing for the comets to hit. I tried to build and upgrade as many podsas I could early in the game, so that I have enough growth generated from thePods to proceed the next level. I invested heavily in protection. Your firstpriority should be to focus on building the pods as fast as possible.Themain thing I learned from the game is that Risk Management can save lives asdepicted in the game, where Alora is at risk from the falling comets andcausing damage and shock to the community and endangering lives. The only wayto succeed is to find the perfect balance. Consider the case of Bangladesh inreal life situation, where improved preparation for natural hazards hadsignificantly reduced the loss of life and property from the Cyclones.Myreflection on the game is that you learn that Risk management is the process ofconfronting risks, preparing for them, and coping with their effects. People,societies and countries gain the ability to recover from negative shocks bybecoming resilient and they also retain the ability to function under riskycircumstances."181.36.7.42,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"1.

In what ways did preparation for risk affect development  (immediately, or after some time)?The role of risk managementin the game was to provide a methodology to identify and analyse financialimpact of loss to the assets on the game (buildings, environment). I have identifying and analysedand took steps to reduce the exposure of loss, by transferring the risk to aninsurance company and through research of the potential risks.The preparation that isintended specifically to reduce risk has an impact on a sustainable developmentas resources are canalized to prevent and mitigate the risk.2.

As such would also provide better mitigation measures thus a bettersustainable development.3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.  Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which  allows you to change or add one simple thing.

It isnecessary to continuously evaluate where your community is standing in terms ofdevelopment, preparedness and safety. The first choice I made was to focus ondeveloping and creating the community while there were periods of no meteors.When the meteors started to come more often, I decided to focus on theirresearch, which gave my community more knowledge and tools to prepare. In thecases where the severity and the chance of a meteor hitting the community washigh, I immediately bought insurance and raised the community to a higherground in order to minimize the damage. I did not fully understand the reasonto connect the yellow glowing structures together, but I always did it andended up minimizing the damage. At the time when more meteors came, thedevelopment of the community became jeopardized and this eventually stopped mefrom reaching level 6, particularly because of the frequency of the meteors andthe time I wanted to spend on researching their potential damage. Â As I mentioned, earlier, I did play the game severaltimes and really did not understand. When I finally understood the game, Iplayed it once and was able to reach level 5. If I were to play it again, Iwould keep a closer look at the development bar. At times I was so worried abutthe damage and the frequency of the meteors, that I forgot about making abetter and more developed community. I also was concerned about trying to keepmy amount of money at a decent level of savings so I could further develop mycommunity in the future, and this kept me from developing. If I were to play itagain, I would spend more money to continue developing.Â Â  Â I would add a public services variable (health andeducation).

There are several types of comets, each one offering unique levels of severity and chances of hit, and the player must chose wisely which instrument use to protect the community from the danger.Â Protection insurance and knowledge are the available ways of protection and each one fits better each different kind of situation.All the options offer trade-offs, the insurance is a good call when there are imminent cases of impact with high levels of damage, but it is expensive and uses resources that could be applied to development. Protection is time consuming and costly, however offers a good option when there are a lot of incoming comets with a low level of severity. Knowledge is the least expensive one, but is only recommended when there is one big threat since it consume the players time and makes it difficult for them to provide measures to generate development and safety from others comets.In the short run the preparation was harmful for the development, but in the long run it was beneficial once resources hadn't to be spent in rebuilt, and the money kept flowing without interruption.Â After having played for a while, it is clear how the player learn to manage the risks. At the first time one will probably try to be fully protected, however as the game goes on it is learnt that resources can be better used. Speaking for myself, after the third level I realized that high cost insurances were not always the best choices and the resources spent in those could be easily used in development. Also, after some matches it was clear how idle resources were Â unproductive for protection and development.In my opinion I would include the possibility of credit in addition of money. Credit Â is something very important in modern day economies and is highly correlated with managing risks and providing development. The credit Â would change the necessity of reserves for difficult times and would also create opportunity to boost development in peaceful times. Some degree of interest rates (that fluctuates from high to low depending on the insurance hired and the level of damage caused by the meteor) could also be included in order to take some elasticity out of the money system and force the player to be less risky."202.131.98.131,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Answer 1:Risk managementGoal: sustainable development rate Risk ChainShocks â€“ cometsExternal environmentâ€“ AloraInternal conditions- time and cash constraint, managing protection, insurance and researchOutcome - developmentbarThe previous stocksaffect protection and skill to manage them so feedback loop is there.Preparation meansefforts before the shocks.Knowledge meansresearch which gives higher time to build community support.

This was a very captivating way of realizing how frequently we needto apply risk management principles, as most of the time we are playing withuncertain factors to make decisions on everything. And it was also a very interesting way of realizingabout the important trade-offs we need to consider for an adequate managementof risk given the scarcity of resources we were constrained to.I started playing in a very defensive or risk-avoidingway (investing too much on protection and insurance, and basically nothing onknowledge), and for that reason I was not making a lot of progress in terms ofdevelopment.Â  Then I started leavingprotection measures aside and concentrated mostly on insurance and development.That also proved wrong (too expensive!) and again I was not able to go toofar.Â  I played the game several times until I was finallyable to identify a strategy that allowed me to reach level 5.

In real life, insurance companieswould be better informed and would not sell an insurance for that kind ofthreat. So it would be good to force players to make earlier decisions, whenthey can take advantage of early knowledge.Another factor that I would adjust a bit is the costof knowledge. In this case it was very cheap for you to find out if thoseapproaching comets were worth an additional investment in protection orinsurance. In real life, knowledge about many threats is not so clear and alsonot so cheap. So it would also be interesting to make it more expensive, to addmore value to its contribution, and also to make you think twice about how muchmoney to invest on it."41.223.64.185,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME. The whole essence of the game scenario is; managing risks from comets and flooding and how to manage it in a community that is susceptible to such calamities. The game calls for thinking strategically i.e balancing between preparing for these inevitable risks and investing in community development on the one hand and also thinking about the different tools one can deploy to confront these risks on the other hand. I often more than not started each level with Insurance, as one progressed, the insurance policies I chose depended largely on how much was available with the need to have small funds on hand for the inevitable repairs coming a distant second in my consideration. More funds tended to be made available if one leads off with purchasing an insurance policy option which I then channeled to properties. Property development was then done and continuously improved as opportunities presented themselves. Research was a sine-qua-non at every opportunity while protecting (raising the island) often came after the green meter is filled. In preparing for inevitable risks, I often slowed new developments but consolidated on existing community awareness relationships often by raising and holding the button on the lower right briefly and leaving it before the green on the upper left completely turns red. Toggling this button intermittently seemed to help occasionally.The game could be addictive though, but one learned to thread the fine line between risk preparation and developing ones community which is quite a thrilling challenge once you get in the game. Spend too much on building and upgrading pods and you will be exposed to comets when they hit. Any damage sustained from comets hinders progress and often means rebuilding at great costs. On the other hand, spending too much on preparing for risks leaves one with not enough money to develop the community sufficiently to make it to another level. One simple thing I would want added is building of flood barrier or levees, at a cost of course, as well as underground bunker housing. The former greatly reduces flood devastation while the latter reduces casualties in the case of direct comet strikes (given advance warning through research, people can be directed to such shelters in time before the comets or floods hit). This option should be made available even from the start of the game so that we can build from the ground up."62.28.82.189,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â Â What was the role of risk managementin the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront interms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation forrisk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Â The role ofthe risk manager on the game was to promote the development of the community, allocatingscare resources not only to development but also to risk management, namelythrough a couple of mitigation tools.The limitedavailable resources, resulted on a sophisticated trade-off between investing indevelopment, in knowledge, in protection and in insurance.Definitely properknowledge and preparation affected significantly the risk management approach,considering (as in real world) limited resources for the task.Also themanagement options and balance between protection and insurance presented veryinteresting results, not rarely an over allocation of resources in face of thereal threats.Definitelydetermining the allocation of resources between Development, Research,Protection and Insurance, itâ€™s not an easy exercise, even when external factorslike Incentives and Behaviors are excluded.Building ahealthy community and create a legacy is definitely a challenge.Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â If you played the game only once,what would you do differently if you were to play it again?

On subsequent plays a better balance between the allocationof resources to develop and risk management, with better results.

I had tojuggle around until I realised that the three components cannot be separated foreffective and efficient risk management. I realised that protection andinsurance, that would be informed by research â€“ the more I researched, thelesser was the chance of hit and severity, was the best way to prepare for riskreduction. Preparing before shocks enables coping afterward and is an essentialtool for development which fosters opportunities. Potential risks were reducedbefore the shock actually occurredI played the game several times.I started concentrating more on growing the community, building on every vacantplots/land. Later, started focusing on research. Much of my resources werechannelled towards this activity and the more I focused on knowing about thesethreats the more the severity and chances of hit reduced. Knowledge is crucial,without it the whole community will be destroyed. Insurance was also helpingupon rebuilding after the shock. It is crucial since in most case the attackoccurs when least expected. I also realised that the more I upgraded my pods,the more resources I received. This enabled me to stand the severity of adisaster occurrence. When structures are built up to standards, theirresistance to risks increases. This also reduces the resources needed to rehabilitateafter a shock.I think I would include copingmechanisms for the communities during and after a shock. There is need to raiseawareness to increase the opportunities in risk management."59.165.106.228,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to protect the resources from maximum damage in scenarios of a comet strike. Initially, I chose to build a couple of plods and insuring them for 50% coverage instantly. But with approximately $1000 in hand, and roughly around 3 minutes to save the planet and get to the next level, I had to get the severity level high to combat the comets. In doing so, I realized that to make too many things happen simultaneously, we need more man power. But here, since it was only me, the process of building, upgrading and increasing immunity towards the comets did not take place as I would have liked it too. When I failed level 1 over two three times, I changed my strategy. To keep the development going, and spreading them all over the place, I kept building around 3 plods. I chose to increase the severity from comets instantly and after having done that to a considerable level, I chose to insure my properties just before a comet strike. So by then, the comet had missed and when the next strike was due, I took a chance to upgrade the plods and spread them along. Also, I built a couple of more new plods. And instantly increased the comet combat level when the level ticker was near yellow. This helped me gain more safety and less damage during a comet attack. Through this, I managed to cross level 2 and almost cleared level 3. So what I basically learnt from this game is that to manage risk, equal proportions of development at every phase must be done. In this case, building the plods and upgrading from time to time, while building more new plods was important. Not only that, we also had to make sure we prepared for the disasters by ensuring some safety management in case of a comet strike. And having known that no strike guarantees how much severe it would be and how badly it would affect any development, we must also make sure to insure our properties in case of such natural calamities. In that way, we do not have to spend exorbitantly in case of such scenarios. I live in Chennai, India, a coastal region of the country and my city is a high earthquake prone zone. If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would add more complexities to the game. What I mean is, the game dealt only with one apocalypse; that is, the comet strike. But there can be cases where a flood and an earthquake could happen successively. My city witnessed Tsunami in 2006 which left the coastal areas flooded and the city areas destroyed due to the earthquake. Various multiple and successive disaster management is what I would add to the newer version of the game if I were given the task which had the same.

Comets that flew in from the sky and infrastructure development were some of the few portfolios to consider. Poor management of these risks would certainly develop inevitable crises on the horizon.Properly managing such risk saw the horizon escape all the possible crises, but rather turning them into opportunities. Utilizing these opportunities contributed to the development and accumulation of wealth. Properly acquiring knowledge on the comets that threatened the horizon through research provided lots of information TO ENHANCE BETTER preparation thereby increasing resilience and protection against the shocks.Playing the game improved my understanding on the importance of knowledge acquisition in solving problems. Effective research on potential shocks solves about 40% of the possible cost in damage that a community could possibly suffer from any risk. In the game I realized a possibility to develop more protection against threats after researching and obtaining confirming information on the approaching risk. I could conserve lots of resources and also raise the appropriate protection in required measurement making necessary preparation ahead of the threat.Proper and effective networking was another way of minimizing the weight of crises. It is very important to act fast and accurately in other to beat the effects of all shocks. There are some threats that appear abruptly leaving the horizon with little time to make proper preparations. The good thing about this type of development is the ability to test the strengths of whatever systems set in place to counter any shock that appears with such a pace. From playing the game and progressing through the levels, I had total control with a good insurance plan and adequate funds to raise protection against such shocks only after suffering similar threats at the previous levels. This strength was only identified when I was able to cope with the shocks received from the threats already encountered.  Development was affected in lots of ways throughout my attempts to lessen the impacts of the incoming shocks. There was an immediate loss in resources but an increase in revenue after threats are dealt with from claims in the insurance packages purchased. There were instances where I began to construct new structures even when I knew greater shocks were advancing at faster rate. That management approach was entirely wrong since protection was not heightened due to the absence of resources. It was only appropriate for me to continue with my development goals only when I had built great resilience through proper research and heightened protective structures backed with good insurance packages. It is always better to focus on development when better protective schemes are instituted to cater for any incoming shock.The game has a very good way of introducing any player into carefully managing risks whiles improving on developmental plans. But I I think the introduction of comets made it an unlikely threat to consider. Situations presented in the course of playing the game are real and they all reflect on real issues in our everyday activities. In choosing a threat for such a game, I will suggest an everyday environmental threat like storms, tsunami, hurricane and earthquakes be presented. In doing so the player gets to relate more with the possibility of facing the threat seen. One threat that will perfectly fit into that of my community is rainstorms. Rain storms are a major to my community. Many houses are destroyed when we are visited with such threats. A lot are rendered homeless and lots of households are thrown into poverty. "80.248.5.192,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management inthe risk horizon game was to ensure that the risks associated with the damageswere managed appropriately.

Risks were represented by the comets, which could strike at any time (or miss) and potentially inflict damage. Risk mitigation was represented by the opportunity to purchase insurance, with varying prices available depending on general growth strategy. Growth was represented by the building and development of the pods. The main thing I learned from the game was that trusting the same method of risk management for each level does not work, as the risks one encounters are generally not the same in every situation. Hard work will get you as far as level 4, but to get further you have to think cleverly about each situation in terms of the actual risks at the time. There are certain actions that are always sensible, for example purchasing insurance, but others that are not, for example pouring money into the pods can lead to you developing your pods too quickly.I am not sure I understood in the later levels what the best method was to get further in the game, or what was wanted of me.Were I tasked with developing a new version of the game I would make it a street full of property with fluctuating prices, ""disasters"" such a infestations of mice and bedbugs, flooding and fires, development opportunities such as home improvements, extensions and gardens, and risk management options such as insurance, sandbags, and mousetraps. I might even include cups of sugary tea to add a light-hearted note which I think was missing from this production. I think this is a day-to-day scenario that is more intuitive to people and would be more easily understood. The problem I had with this game was that I didn't really know what it was that was driving the score and as a result I overdeveloped my pods but I am not quite sure how I could have known when enough was enough. I saw the metre go yellow and red but i didn't know what the correct action was, because I am not usually confronted with the need to build and protect space pods from comets and I didn't understand the difference between the various stages of development, and why one was better than another.This completes my thoughts on the matter and I feel adding a further 200 words would be wasting the reader's time and I hope I won't be penalised for keeping it simple.

As an illuminator of Alora, I had to balance development, protection, research and insurance to achieve milestones within a stipulated time indicated by the progress bar while saving pods from falling comets. Role of risk management is to design a suitable dynamic strategy for efficient allocation of available resources to achieve milestones with time limitation. I chose to research about falling comets before their impact well in advance and chose protection over insurance early in the game. I got protection to 3 levels before substantial development. I research falling comets with more severity than the protection I had. Then I tried to build communities after impact of comets to minimize their impact of development and progress bar. Preparation for risk consumes resources which otherwise could have been used for development immediately but protects harm imposes by comets later. Therefore, a find balance is needed between protection and development.2. First time I played the game I gave too much emphasis on insurance and did not use protection. But after a few trials and learning from tutorial, I came to know the importance of protection. In first few trials, I was not aware about community development after impact of comets, which I realized later on while playing the tutorial. It has improved my chances of success in the game substantially. Due to lack of time, I could successfully complete level 2 of the game. I also noticed that time for each level was substantially less and even after building all pods, progress bar could not go to desired levels. The main thing I learned from the game was that in real life situations when external factors change dynamically, it is tougher to take decisions to achieve progress milestones with limited resources and time. I understood the dilemma our leaders may be facing while deciding economic policies in a uncertain environment.Â 3. I would like to change one simple thing, i.e. , allowing less time to have more protection by lifting the island easily and in less time. That will reduce the impact of most comets damaging the development on the island. This feature should be changed since before the strike of higher severity comets, there is no time available to have enough protection level to counter their impact. In my place, luckily there are no such plenty of damaging things like falling comets or restricting things or person.

As risk management processes became more advanced in the game, it allowed for the development of more elaborate buildings and ultimately more income that could have been re-invested into the development process. It also afforded the player the ability to strengthen their city's protection levels as well as to expand on the knowledge base of its virtual charges.In my many attempts at the game, I discovered the importance of striking balance and how difficult it truly was to achieve. Early on in the game, insurance and reinforcingprotection levels played prominent roles in my strategy.In my early attempts, I found it difficult to be able to match the required protection to the impending comet disaster. I tried to rely too heavily on the insurance aspect which often left me with too little time to recover. Increased protectionlevels ensured that the comets did not devastate the buildings, which oftenwould prove costly (in terms of finances and recovery time). Often, a lack ofprotection proved disastrous for development of the buildings in the game. Insurance ensured that losses were kept to a minimum in the event that the protection level was unable to withstand the intensity of the comet. Asthe game progressed, however, it became necessary to ensure that a delicatebalance of knowledge, protection and insurance since it became increasingly more difficult to ensure that there was progress. Indeed, knowledge of the intensities of the various comets and increased protection levels became increasingly more important. Additionally, insurance premiums became more expensive as the game progressed which made it increasingly more difficult to purchase early in the respective levels. Thus it became necessary to ensure that the protection was of the highest quality or make sure that you were able to purchase the needed insurance before a major disaster had occurred. The main things I learned was that risk management is a vital tool for policymakers in the development process. I also learned that disasters tended to hit at the most inopportune times in the game, which highlighted the need for a stringent risk management strategy.If tasked with improving the game, I would include an agricultural aspect. This would allow the player to simulate a wider spectrum of disasters and would actually ground the game in a more humanistic manner. In the insurance aspect, there could be insurance for flooding as well as against pestilence. If the player has to ensure that the food supply of their virtual charges are not negatively impacted, it could provide them with the opportunity to be more empathetic if ever they reach the corridors of power and they are in a situation to affect positive change within their particular sphere of influence.

Knowledge(research) didnâ€™t cost money, but it took up time. Though it increasedprotection without a fee, it was only specific to that one comet, like researchinto floods wonâ€™t help fight malaria. Unless it was a high-impact comet, I onlyresearched to the lower level of â€œchanceâ€ù or â€œseverityâ€ù. I tried to get myprotection into the blue because it lowered the possibility of damage from anycomet. Because of my lack of money, I couldnâ€™t increase the protection to 10while reaching the development goal. Insurance was about as expensive asdeveloping one pod. I had to remind myself that it wasnâ€™t cost-prohibitivebecause it was made up while rebuilding. After I failed 3 times, changing mystrategy got me to level 5. I decided to only buy insurance once, instead ofwasting the 25% fees. I had to switch from 75% insurance to 50% insurance,since I would get hit by comets while waiting to accumulate the fee. 50% insurancekept the cost of rebuilding down while letting me build after buying it. I alsodecreased the amount of protection I was using so I could focus more ondevelopment, but I had insurance right from the get go. (I was showing a bit ofmoral hazard, but my strategy worked.) I replenished my protection after everycompact impact. I made sure I did a little research on every comet so I wouldknow if I needed more protection.I would add a democratic aspect.Each pod would have a â€œneglect barâ€ù, which would decrease development if it gottoo high. (i.e., if other pods were being developed more than that particularpod, or if it was damaged for a long period of time.) This reflects thedifficulty that politicians in the United States have with the fear of beingvoted out of office. Constituents whose protection is working properly forgetabout disasters and start to question its value. Â I often caught myself protecting too highlyafter rebuilding from an impact.I learned that it is very difficultto allocate resources. If I had good ex ante management, I often wasnâ€™tdeveloping quickly enough. I understand now why developing countries havedifficulties with risk management: their development needs demand more of theirscant resources.(I thought this was supposed to be a 400 word essay, so I edited to get it down to 400 from 550... that's why it's not 600.)"164.143.240.34,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The Risk Horizon game was an interesting way to illustratehow risk management can be done through a combination of knowledge, protectionand insurance. What is important to note also is the objective of the game,which can be translated in real life situation in that the player/policy makerwould like to go for rapid development and growth whilst also mitigating forrisk of a negative event from occurring. The resources, in this case, thefinances are finite and need to be balanced between the use for development andrisk management. Risk management in this aspect includes three components whichare (1) knowledge, which in this case is research to understand the possibleimpact of a disaster; (2) ensuring protection which are actions taken to reducethe level of losses from a negative shock or improve benefits from a positive shock;and (3) purchasing insurance which is a transfer of risk to the insuranceprovider when negative events strike, by paying a premium at good times, priorto any negative event.With increasing level of research, the knowledge of the severityof the disaster and its probability of hitting the area is enhanced andtherefore it is expected that precautions or mitigating actions are more likelyto be in place. From this game, there are two mitigating actions, which arebuilding protection against a disaster and also taking out insurance to protectagainst the cost post-disaster. Protection takes a longer time to build andcosts money. Given the time to build protection that is sufficient to overcomethe severity of the impact, this is the best mechanism to go for to adequatelyprotect an area from disaster. However, if there isnâ€™t time to build sufficientprotection, insurance could be purchased to limit the post-disaster rebuildingcosts. However, insurance usually does not cover 100% of the impact and the impactpost-disaster is not often only financial but also emotional. This often times isnot considered in the cost-benefit analysis. Therefore, protection is betterthan insurance, but both should be implemented in balance. Having too muchinsurance and too much protection is ideal, but this needs to be balanced withthe finite finances and the need for using the finances for development.If development is coupled with good protection and riskmanagement, then the rate of development may be slowed down. However, in thelong term, this not only is better from a financial point of view, but itbecomes a culture of society to appreciate good risk management. By playingthis game a few times and experimenting with different strategies, I realised Ineeded to find a good balance between developing, ensuring protection for theseverity of the hit and getting sufficient insurance. At first, I always wentfor the insurance option and over protected, but that affected my developmentand slower development led to lower replenishment of my finances. In the laterrounds, I ensured a balance of these aspects, but most importantly I paidattention to the level of protection to match it up with the level of comet andthe probability of that comet hitting the area. The main lessons learned is thebalance that is needed to ensure healthy development, without putting too muchat risk and this is directly translated to how risk management should beapplied to in real life.I live in London, where a lot of the risk management are inplace, in regulations and in everyday lives. Although important, many peoplewho I have spoken to have always complained about the rigour of some of thethings being implemented and the inflexibility that these measures have causedthem. Hence I think the sharing of the knowledge and the reason behind why someof these are important should be more widely available to not only allow abetter understanding by the community, but also trigger behavioural changeswhich will incorporate risk management."181.208.244.249,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"RISK HORIZONE. I have learneda momentous lesson in a fun way.By Juan Antonio Andara (juanandara@gmail.com)Under the Risk Management Course, sponsored bythe World Bank in Coursera network, I received a great lesson. Experience inrisk management game RISK HORIZONE allowed me to experience important aspects. First, it is the requirement to hold the balance between the developments ofthe village, the level of insurance and the level of knowledge about meteoritesapproaching the planet. It included also coping with the events once they shockthe village to maintain the health of the system. The game requires making trade-offs betweeninvesting in Knowledge, Protection or Insurance to manage risks. Also it had animpact on the decisions: the probability of collision, the ability to damagethe meteorite and the vulnerability of the area.The integrated action of all these elements wasdynamic and complex character. Especially, since it demanded levels ofachievement in a short period of time.Â Second, the needs to be monitoring thepossible impacts of meteorites at sea, affecting growth village. Not allmeteorites were as likely to impact the planet. For this reason, meteorites didnot require the same attention. Those who were more likely to impact and higherlevel of damage should have more attention and research.Third, once occurring impacts of meteorites inthe sea, the game required a significant reaction to the event. The object ofthis action was to reduce the damage to the houses. According to the level ofdamage inflicted to the structures, I had to come to invest in repairinginvesting resources that I could have been used for development of the area. The level of insurance allowed making thedecision to invest according to the stage of the game and the correspondingdanger level. To the extent that I increased levels of the game, in that actionwas required to invest much more in the level of insurance, divertingdevelopment resources to pay for the growing demand for security.It is a virtue of the game, providing theexperience of variables simultaneously handle risk management in order toachieve further development, with the risks involved in its management. Anyerror or imbalance in decision always hit the level of development andintegrity of the area. If I had played once, I have had worse resultsthan I had. I understood that risk management requires practice to understandhow to balance the elements that affect their dynamics. I learned that riskmanagement in complex, dynamic and successive responds to changing conditions.And it should be decided properly or undesirable events happen.I find it surprising that so far has notintegrated risk management to the management of development, since their impactis direct and real. Not a game. The limited consideration of the risk levels ofdevelopment in each action has brought very negative consequences for manycountries. RISK HORIZONE is a game that can experience it without riskingresources and people, letting you learn a great lesson in a fun way.In my country, the entire population is affectingby occurrence of rain or drought. Therefore, I should replace the meteoroids byclouds or sun, indicating drought or rainfall events in order to make decisionsbased on them. Another important aspect is that in my countrypublic institutions are very weak. Therefore people in very high grade,survives by his own efforts. Often, they depend on support from the community.I would add to the game the ability to create networks of support among thecommunity as a key aspect to deal with risk.Â "41.63.2.26,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management accordingto investopedia is defined as the process of identification, analysis andeither acceptance or mitigation of uncertainty in investment decision-making.Â Risk management in this game is playing the role of acquiringknowledge (research) and putting in protective measures while also mitigatingthe impact of lose in form of insurance. During the game, I had to choosewhether to invest in more research, gain more protection, pay maximum insuranceor develop the neighborhood. I found myself spending more on insurance andresearch. Reason being, when I paid the maximum on insurance, it reduced the costof repairing against damage caused. And the more I spent on research, I foundthat I understood the impact the meteors would cause which in turn helped medecide which protection measure to take. In trying to prepare for risk, I foundthat development was slow because I had to split the resources between researchand development. Striking a balance on what to spend on was really challenging.The first time I focused more on tryingto develop the land at a go and gaining protection. However, the second timearound I narrowed down to three projects, spent more on research and insurance allthe while trying to put in protective measures. I realized that the fewerprojects I invested in at a go, the more resources I had to spend on upgrades andresearch.Overall, I learnt that in as much asresearch, protection and insurance are all important components of riskmanagement, it is not always possible to invest in all of them at once. This isso because limitations in resources come in and there is need to decide andweigh the options on which one you would want to invest in first or rather howmuch you are willing to spend for either one of them. I found it more rewardingto focus on research and developing the land at a go because the researchhelped in understanding how much protection my investment needed. I also wentfor the full insurance premium because once my projects suffered damage orshock, I was able to repair them at a much lower cost than if I had spent lesson insurance i.e. putting in place coping mechanisms.I think insurance is a form ofprotection, as such I would recommend the two are not separated but rather embeddedin one feature.Â Â Â Â "108.230.93.214,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1What was the role of risk management inthe game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did youconfront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In whatways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, orafter some time)?The role of risk management in the gamecentered around building, insurance and research of the incomingcomets. The trade-offs centered on brisk building costs offset byhigh insurance costs to then study the comet approaching. Continualbuilding was required in order to move forward in the game while thesetbacks could be mitigated by research which gave you more time tolessen the damage. The high insurance cost could be dealt with bybuying early in the round when it was cheaper due to the lower valueof the property. The more building you did drove up the cost of theinsurance as a whole. The rate of wealth was steady while the cometsseverity could change radically. Several misses could create a windowof opportunity to meet your goal. The flip side was as the comets hitsteadily you had no increase in wealth to catch up during the round.Insurance was the only way to lessen the rebuilding process andresearch gave you more of a chance to lessen the heavy damage.Raising the level of the property seemed to be counter productivewith the time constraints.2If you played the game only once, whatwould you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively,if you played the game more than once, what did you do differentlyafter the first time? What were the main things you learned from thegame?I played the game multiple timesbecause I am conservative by nature while the game required anaggressive approach. Acquiring wealth was not paced with the amountof devastation that could be unleashed on the properties. Forinstance I had a 70% destruction with 75% insurance and there was notime to rebuild and meet your goal. In such a scenario you would needa faster wealth pace and a longer time horizon.  I definitely learnedto change the rate of insurance buying to early in the round andresearch of the sever comets for longer periods created the bestresults. Building aggressively also became a focus of the game as yousaw how important it was to going to the next round. 3The game captures, in a simplified way,some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked withdeveloping a new version of the game, which allows you to change oradd one simple thing. What change would you propose to betterrepresent the risk management choices that matter in the place youlive?Auburn, California would have less riskof catastrophic happenings in the time horizon. Auburn does notexperience catastrophic events generally of any kind. The game wouldneed to allow for less severe outcomes  and the insurance andresearch costs could come way down. Meeting and maintaining thebuilding requirements would be much more attainable due to the newrisk averse model. The big change to the game for Auburn would bereleasing water to So. California during a drought. Managing thecontracts to allow for this expected risk would be my change in thegame for this area. If the resevoirs were able to build up over thelean years, the area would have not problem meeting the demands forwater in the region. Due to the contracts created to keep the waterflowing out of the reservoirs, their purpose is negated. Our gamefocus would be on water flow management."200.182.161.10,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risks are around us everyday in the society; not only in our personal lives but in the company we workfor, projects we run, community we live and world/environment we are part of.The awareness and skills to deal with these daily risks are key elements toprevent them to become issues, when exploring negative risks, or to takeadvantage of opportunities. The game was very nice to help us students tounderstand that everything starts with information (as when analyzing themeteor impact probability and damage), followed by preventive measures (elevatethe ground) and/or in insurance, especially when the preventive measures werenot enough. Development of the silos (units) was key to keep population happyand producing, so the incentives also were key to progress in the game. This isthe same as in the live. In rural areas, government incentives will allowpeople to take more risks and grow, while insurance and preventive measures canprevent damage to the plantations. In urban areas, companies need to foreseenot only the events that would harm business, but allow employees to take risksas opportunities for internal growth, and allow people to fail because withoutthat very few will want to adventure and take calculated risks.Thetraining so far is very good, and I am eager to start weeks 3 and 4!Â Â "41.223.105.195,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAMEWhat was the role of riskmanagement in the game?

Â The choices I had to make included: when to press the protection button only, when to purchase the insurance and when to purchase the insurance and press the protection button to prevent damage to the pods if the comet hit the island. In addition I had to make choices on when to build he pods and when o protect the already built pods from the falling comets. The trade offs included stopping to build the pods to either continuously hold the protection button or to purchase the insurance. Â As for the way preparation affected development immediately was that either, the comet Â missed to hit the pods or if it did, there was no damage and therefore, there was no time lost in terms of development Â or resources wasted..2) I played the game more than once and this is what Â I did after the first time. I went back to the tutorial Â and mastered it. It provided very good guidance. and when played the game second time I Â made progress up to level four (4) of the game. The things that I learned are a) Knowledge is critical if one is to make the right decision. Decision on when to press the protection button only or press the protection button and purchase insurance at the same time was guided by the information provided on the comets. In addition the speed at which the comets were falling as well as the number approaching the island guided my decision whether to just press the protection button only or to press the protection button and purchase insurance to compliment each other. Â 2) Protection is important for risk management. By pressing the protection button, the comet would miss to hit the pods. 3) Insurance and protection compliments each other. When comet managed to hit the pod, there was no damage and was relieving to see no lost development as indicated by the development bar. 4) Action taken and on a timely bases makes the difference. I learned that that I had to take action and on timely bases to prevent the comet from hitting a pod or if it did, not to cause damage.3)The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices Â that matter in the place where I live Â is to add Â the aspect of copingÂ "196.44.109.213,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-36.0 to 1.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"Not withstanding the technical difficulties posted by the game, I can say that the key role of risk managemnt was how to balance in strengthening the community to that of preventing being destroyed using the given resources, protection and insurance. At certain points, I had to choose if I first build my pods or deal with the comets. At times, I had to deal with spending the resources available for constructing the pods or using the resource for protection. I would say that I did not really see the very impact of preparation to risks in relation to development in the game. But definitely, it is preparedness that helps in already winning half of the battle.The first time I tried the game, it was exploratory and then I went more into tactical approach after learning of the resources that I can use. I just started to construct the pods and only then prepared for the comet. I will change the pacing specially when there are 2 comets coming so that response can be faster. It is really the knowledge of where things are, how to use them at a given time and tactically releasing them at a given moment that I learned from ther game. But of course, it is also the winning over after having tried all sorts of approaches; gaining ground since we want to address the risks that are present and could still be coming. It was harder when there were more comets coming at almost the same time and the response (due to lack of resources) is slow. This seem to be the case whenever there were more comts coming.I would propose to have a given and existing security within the community since we are not starting from scratch; e.g. facilities and infrastrcutre that can be improved or further integrated into other resources to a given vulnerable area or existing knowledge that can be further enhanced thus being more concrete and creative.

There were three ways to achieve this, by researching the comets, protection from the comet impact, and insurance. I left protection to the last, every time I tried making that a priority over research I ended up losing the game. My first priority was insurance, second was research followed by protection. Every time I made protection a priority my development was affected immediately. But the further I got along in the game, the lack of protection hampered my development even more. I learned that you can't spend all your money on development. You have to save some for the after effects of the comet. If I were to play again for the first time I would definitely buy the highest insurance first, not the lowest. I would change the initial building of new developments. You would have two options first standard home, the second re-enforced homes that receives less damage but cost double the price. You would have to trade off more expensive development initially for savings later.What would I change to represent risk management choices where I live is a tough question. I currently live in Denmark, but I am from Detroit. In Denmark the worst disasters are typically flooding or loss of employment. Both are well represented with risk management choice in the game, but if I were to use Detroit as a reference I would have to add a ""police enforcement"" option. An excessive amount of looting/riots happens after a disaster, and you need some type of law enforcement to keep the peace, so to speak. I would add training and employing police option each level like the insurance.

Â So given these information I tried to have protection or insurance in place. Â At the same time, to maximize the resources I have to build/repair pods or pay for these protection and insurance, I was mindful of the incoming comets.

All these scenario analyses use past information and patterns to come up with possible outcomes to be able to act accordingly or decide which solution to take.If I were to enhance this game, I think the decision on whether to click on the comet at any given time as opposed to building/repairing pods would be facilitated if there was an indication how much it is worth.

The principal parameters/components of a comprehensive risk management strategy are the elements to bedealt with in the context of a wider model involving three key dimensions:Technology, Economics and Institutions. =TheTrade-Offs.-ProtectingAlora is based on the cost-benefit analysis of Protection, Knowledge andInsurance, in order to mitigate the impact of comets and thus to avoid therisks of destruction. The balanced allocation of resources is critical withinthe strategic risk management approach. It is understood that protecting thebuilt-physical infrastructure of Alora is based on investing in: 1.- â€œknowledgeand technologyâ€ù, which addresses risk assessment and an evaluation of potentialdamage based on the evaluation of the size and energy of the comets; 2.- â€œProtectionâ€ùof the existing infrastructure (e.g., improved building codes); and 3.- â€œInsuranceâ€ùthat should be considered an investment and a component of risk preparation/prevention and guaranteed resilience.=TheLearning.-And sinceresources in the game and in the real life are scarce, economic and technicaltradeoffs are made to achieve the development of Aloraâ€™s planet and society. The strategic risk management model has been clearly understood through playing the game.=The Game.- I enjoyedthe game, once I had a full screen. At first, I had problems with my browserwhich prevented me from following the instructions. I opened a differentbrowser and then I was able to take the tutorial and play the game. I am not agood player of this type of games. In fact, I played it repeatedly and was notable to go beyond Level 2. But I did understand, clearly, the role of the componentsand the tradeoffs involved.

Buying multiple pods encourages a support system, and encourages multiple investments, although not to the extent I would like (I will touch on this later). In this game we must evaluate how to manageour risk in order to appropriate our money into investments, whether that isdirect investment in the pods, or for insurance and investment. I playedthe game twice, the first time I was testing it out. On my first try, I alwayskept 75% (best possible) insurance.

Thereason for this is that insurance is a large initial investment, and Iâ€™d ratherspend that investment on pods in order to increase my money and my green bar. Because Ikept money to myself the second game more than the first it could be said thatinsurance allowed myself to invest instantly, therefore promoting economicprogress, which was not the situation the second time I played. In order to improve the game, I would allow insurance tocost more, because I currently believe the game is set so insurance is highlypreferable. Also, I believe that multiple investments are not encouraged enough,because meteors destroy all pods, which is not often the case in real life (ex.why investors often diversify their stock portfolio). In review, I enjoyed the game a lot more than I thought Iwill, and may play it a couple more times after submitting this review. "212.98.140.41,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The purpose of the Risk HorizonÂ game is to develop the â€œAloraâ€ù community,while meeting certain milestones for development. There are 6 levels to thegame; but I did not succeed in completing all 6 levels. The game allowed me to understandthe value of balancing risk preparation and healthy development. â€œAloraâ€ù is atthe risk of falling â€œcometsâ€ù, i.e. â€œshocksâ€ù, andÂ  â€œwavesâ€ù i.e. the subsequent impacts. At core to succeeding in the game was toset and achieve a balance between growing the â€œAloraâ€ù community and preparingfor these potential shocks and associated impacts. However,this balance comes at a cost. Preparing for shocksand creating tradeoffs among the different elements of risk preparation cost money. Another constraint worthy of mentioning was â€œtimeâ€ù; we were on the clock! Risk preparation does affect development. Preparing for risks, and the possibility of copingwith impacts, paves the way for development; it creates the necessary cultivating environmentfor development. Progress is not tangible right away, but it is in prolonged continuous risk management thatdevelopment can be achieved. It is worth noting nonetheless, that riskmanagement and development are commensurate. During myfirst attempts at the game, I was so wary of managing the risks, that I forgotthe primary purpose, which is â€œdevelopmentâ€ù. Risk management serves development,Â in preparing andcoping with approaching shocks. I lost track of the main goal, but onlyaddressed approaching threats. I failed toappreciate the underlying trade-offs between development and the elements ofrisk preparation which exist to serve development as a primary aim, and notjust to eliminate threats and their consequences. When I playedthe game again, I made sure to focus on development, while preparing and copingwith risks as they occurred. I had to pay attention to two things:(1) thedevelopment bar, to keep close watch on the development progress; and (2) Theapproaching commits, to check the severity, the chance of hit, and how muchinfo is known about each. For starters,my main aim was to develop pods to meet the required developmentmilestones. During this development process, I â€œkept my eyes on the horizonâ€ù,while looking out for those approaching â€œcommitsâ€ù. At core to this was to make surethat the preparation efforts are well in place. I kept monitoring the approaching commits, and makingsure that the degree of severity matches the protection measures put in place. I purchased sufficientinsurance coverage, whichwould assist in coping with the shocks and avoiding significantconsequences to the ongoing development efforts. Research was alsoa core constituent in preparation, serving to provide thepertinent knowledge to understand these shocks, their conditions and potentialoutcomes, thus reducing related uncertainties; it also createdcommunity connections, and this reflected the collective role of all parties in risk management.The game was a good â€œmodelâ€ù that allowedus to put into practice the acquired principlesÂ concepts of risk management. This gamesurely reflected the trade-offs and synergies involved in risk management fordevelopment. It provided a good tool to understand the concepts acquired duringweeksÂ 1 2 of this course, in an interactive and fun manner. Followingthis game, I am confident that I have fully acquired the basic concepts ofrisk management. I understood the importance of risk preparation, in that all threeelements of â€œprotectionâ€ù, â€œresearchâ€ù and â€œinsuranceâ€ù serve development andpave the way for a growing environment and community. All we need to do is keepour eyes out on the horizon, while keeping at core the importance ofdevelopment as a primary aim, which allÂ other elements stand to serve. All elementsof risk management are well represented in this game; however, what the game does not cater for isthe presence of two or more simultaneously occurring risks. This would in factadd complexity to the game, but it is interesting to see this happen."83.191.82.159,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk Horizon game is very interesting game, it is one of the most useful and effective ways to manage potential risks in our community. It's has a leading role in risk management field. The game highlighted the three significance concepts of risk management for sustainable development. which is research or knowledge of risk mapping, protection and insurance. I think these concepts are very important for any risk reduction and  contingency planning. From the gram and to be more practical, if we going to manage any potential risk in our communities, we should simply based our actions and planning on risk mapping, regarding to evidence-based knowledge or research. Without a appropriate data and deep knowledge related to the risk mapping we can not prepare effectively, In case we managed to prepare very well, this well leads to long-term prevention and protection from the any potential disasters that going to hit our communities. From this game I got many practical benefits. Firstly,  risk management is a high priority in our communities, particularity, in terms of long-term planning and keeping our resources functional.  whit risk management we can invest more and more in the limited resources we posses, as well as  have best practices and cost-effective system to keep these resources functioning in our community as long as possible.

The role of risk management was in preparation for the risk (from the comets) that can happen. We had to choose how to spend resources - for building community, insurance, protection, etc.Â Trade-offs were made between development of new plot and Â upgrading of existing one (or upgrade of a more developed to less developed), we also had to trade-off insurance and protection. And higher level of protection had to be traded off to upgrading plots (as there was a much higher cost).Preparation for the risk affected development after some time in early stages of game as affect could be seen after impacts of comets, but immediately on later levels of game as there was a much higher cost for preparations and money could be invested in development of community. It can be said that protection of a developed community has a higher alternative cost.2. I've played game several time. I preferred to invest in upgrading then in building all the plots. (I would even say that this game should that community can't develop on the same level. Some inequality brings a faster and more efficient development for community). On later levels of game I preferred to invest into protection as Â more developed the community more destruction were brought to the community and more time and resources were needed to restore it.Â The game showed again that we have very limited resources and we should think about how to distribute them effectively. It also showed that research is very necessary in order to understand what risk exist, what is their probability and what impact they can make. The game showed the importance of protection that includes preventive measures Â and measures that can help to cope with aftermath. It also showed that equality doesn't always allow us to use resources effectively for development.Research had a big influence on how to spend resources. It showed whether we could spend them for building community (if comet wasn't to hit) or to spend them for protection or insurance (if it hit us and how much to spend in dependence of severity).Â 3. I would add people in a separate group of resources. People are the main consumer of all the resources, they are also the ones who are going to help to cope with aftermath. Less people means less human resources who can work physically or less specialist who know what to do in such situation or who can be a leader in such situation.Â I would also separate research in several groups - more and less expansive as all the researches have their cost.Â "62.204.192.247,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Dear friends,I am really worried about the risk-horizon game.

Theriskhorizon game give us four tools: research â€“scientific research to knowmagnitud of risk and its consequecenes, always in probabilities words-,protection â€“where nobody knows how much protection is needed, but whereprudential principle is recommended-, insurance â€“that is needed to buy it inthe market- and a special kind of solidarity, that can emerge from the linksbetween pods.Every one of these tools drive to a social system. Researchto the scientific system, with their own logic. The game shows us theimportance of research and so the cost of research. The cost of a scientific systemcould be very high and its results are so sure as so difficult to see. Protection belongs to the political system. Speciallyinfrestructure policies of protection that emerge from the status. The traditionalor modern state is the institution created by societies to reach some commonprotection. More, we can say protection is the basement of modern state, as isoutlined by authors as Thomas Hobbes.Insurance is in the market system. It is a investiment tocover the problems in the future. I have to say that this World Bank courseremarks the importance of the market throughout the importance of insurance.World Bank wants to teach us that the market is the solution. At least, it isthe solution when problems came. But, can the market to solve the problemsconsequences of big catastrophes, as broad famines, earhquarkes or similar events? I think thatmarket alone canâ€™t. It is needed the state protection. Insurance is important,but not enough.Andsolidarity is the last. Then we talk about social tissue. Then we talk aboutsociety system as it is described by authors as German sociologist Luhmann. Theall game is a society metaphore, but it is not easy to think that links betweenpods could be interpreted as solidarity. I believe in solidarity as an importanttools when misfortunes arrive. Solidarity transform people in actors, incitizens.But the gameis designed from the responsible authorities. The player have to believe it canmanage every resources: research, protection, insurance and solidarity. Ofcourse, you learn the necessity of every tool, and specially the necessity of abalance between them because those resource require money, work and time. Acommunity â€“or a country- could have time. Likely work, if it has a formedpopulation. But what about the money? In the game, money is there. It is on theleft hand of the screen. But what does it happen in real life?Â I spite of my (personal) problems of accesibility, I enjoy the logic of the game. A recommendation to next editions: please to think in people with very limited devices or with old and slow computers is required. An institution as World Bank, very concerned to people in underdeveloped countries have to think in those problems, that are very different of comprehension problems."197.253.16.130,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The risk management game brought to light the trade-offs between risk and opportunity.  There were financial implications to every attempt to develop a plot. Purchasing Protection, Insurance, or knowledge had their own financial commitments which also had implications on how much I could develop on the plots. However, the insurance I purchased reduced how much I needed to rebuild destroyed pots.The second and third time I played the game. I took more advantage of the insurance which ensured that I spent less on rebuilding destroyed pots "202.158.222.209,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game was difficult at first, however it was quiteinformative and insightful and a great visualisation of the potential riskmanagement approaches in this scenario. I found the concept of trade-offs veryinteresting. In particular, it forced me to consider the reality that resources(including access to funding) can be a more significant challenge fordeveloping countries. It is clear that comprises need to made in riskmanagement to achieve the best result with the resources available. In the first attempt of the game I did not fully understandthe importance of research and networks in preparing for, and responding to, crises.In subsequent attempts I spent a great deal more time researching, which led tomore time for community network rebuilding after the crisis hit. As a result, Ichose to spend less time on last minute protection, to ensure that I couldspend enough time researching which appeared to have a better result ofminimising damage. I also spent more money on insurance in the later games,which in turn led to less resources spent on repairing pods after the crisis. By preparing for risk, through insurance, research andbuilding community networks, I was able to spend less time reacting to thecrisis (repairing). As a result, I had more resources available to spend on buildingadditional pods and developing existing ones. It also allowed more time to bespent researching, which allowed greater community networks to form. This showsthat investment in risk management before a crisis hits, can have a positiveflow-on effect and actually save money in the long-term. Prevention may notalways be possible; however I would still argue that minimising damage andresponse time to a crisis could be considered effective risk management. Proposed changeIf I were to make a change to the game, I would introduce afew different types of crises to show how one size does not fill all with riskmanagement approaches, particularly in different locations around the world. Thiscould perhaps be done in the higher levels and would help to demonstrate thatthe appropriate level of preparation, knowledge and insurance can differdepending on the situation. In some cases, knowledge and preparation may bemore important and effective in preventing disaster, than insurance would beminimising damage. Likewise this could be the opposite, depending on thesituation, location, communities and government in question. Although the gameshowed different levels of severity and chance well, I think that includingvarious forms of disaster could be a worthwhile addition to the game. "194.126.10.35,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The dynamics within the game are interesting in the way you need to balance a. research on the risks, b. mitigation measures through networking, c. the need for insurance coverage, and d. the desire to expand the business. this requires thinking simultaneously about these dynamics and seeing how they affect each other. for instance, if the risk (the meteor) will hit anyway, then it don't make sense to suddenly invest and not preserving the needed cash for reconstruction, what is required in this case is to keep on clicking on the mitigation measures to minimize the actual impact of the risk. In all cases i opted for the maximum insurance given the increased expected saving, particularly that you get hit all the time with meteors, especially the property in the middle line. So what i did is built three units in the top and bottom and left the center empty, and upgraded them as soon as i could. this allowed me sufficient resources to rebuild.A critique on this case is that it does not simulate real life situations, who would invest in such a high-risk environment? Furthermore, the insurance compensation was 3-times as much as a the premium in each situation, and we know that real life does not work like that. The game illustrates the key messages, however it could've been designed to be closer to real life situations. Plus, research does not always give you detailed information about the risks, particularly systemic and devastating risks the report and the MOOC discusses. Just my two cents. Cheers.

According to the Report, ""risk management can produce resilienceand resilience is the ability to mitigate losses from adverse shocks and tofoster recovery"". This objective is met via managing Alora's risks (shocks, that is comets), firstly by identifying each risk/shock (comet) and then by analysing the characteristics ofeach risk/shock (comet), separately. Having done that, it fosters Alora's recovery from any damages and leads to overall development.All the aspects of the preparatory process(research/protection/insurance) we . However, as I was playing the game, two were the most pivotal factors that were constantly present and impactedon my decisions: a) the speed of each comet, whichwas a pivotal factor that urged me to take important decisions underpressurised conditions and b) the financial constraints.In particular: with regard to the knowledge/research aspect of thepreparatory process, I relied on the relevant notification which was available for eachcomet. This information signalled the level of analysis and research needed to understandthe nature and the potential severity of each comet. With regard to the protectionaspect, I was investing in more upgraded pods based on the criteria of a) theseverity of the comet and b) the number of comets ready to hit Alora. Finally,with regard to the insurance aspect, I took my decisions based on a) myfinancial resources/capacity and b) the number of existing pods (ex. I judgedthat I needed a higher level of insurance when I had 6 pods than when I had 3pods).Risk management affected positively the development ofAlora via building pods step-by-step (and thus: expanding the areas where I could intervene and provide effective risk management) and upgrading the existing ones, gradually. This helpedme to create a more resilient system, where I could potentially take more decisionsfor the benefit of Alora's people as a whole. So, I believe that the developmental contribution was both short-term and long-term.2)I played the game more than once, and the main thingthat I changed was my approach: I considered all the three aspects of thepreparatory process ad hoc, based on the dimension which needed more attention according to each shock.The learning outcomes after having played this game was that I realised thesignificance of being proactive and of sharing the information with all thecommunities/stakeholdersÂ present in Alora. This facilitated the dissemination of theavailable information and knowledge, and led to strengthening the resilience of Alora asan entire system.The particular online game was a really successful educational toolthat helped me bridge the theoretical background gained from the availablematerial in the first two weeks, with a virtual implementation of the conceptsas they are provided by the World Bank Development Report 2014. 3)A recommendation for the future in the place I live: In the place Ilive there is a problem in throwing the recycled materials in the proper bins.The target in this case is to change the behavioral attitudes and norms of theneighbours, which could be achieved through better education as well asdiscussion and a common campaign fostered by the more environmentally sensitiveneighbours.Â "71.164.183.181,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,36.0 to 40.0,17.0 to 30.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"The role of risk management in the game was to balance insurance, protection and research while also progressing forward with development without stagnating. Â As there was and impending and unavoidable risk, I found it best to always purchase the highest level insurance in order to prepare for the worst. I would then build, upgrade and develop while alternating between researching meteors and raising the ground level for protection. My behavior was most risky for the first few seconds at the beginning of each round as I waited to accrue enough money to buy the best insurance, but this paid off as I was never hit during this time.I played the game multiple times as I wanted to achieve the highest possible level. Â Each time I tweaked the balance between building, protection and research. Â I found it best by the end to build as many structures as possible and then to upgrade equally each level, while owning the highest level of insurance and if time and budget allowed as I was nearing my development goal I would then raise the foundation as I found this more beneficial than researching individual meteors, which became my last priority or a filler task when waiting to accrue money. Â I learned to balance impending risk v. expected risk v. unlikely risk and how to balance taking risks for future security and stability.I would add an aspect to where the land didn't just sink back down to sea level when hit but rather to sink below sea level gradually which could simulate added flood risks, earthquakes, sinkholes and negative results from Fracking. Â I live in Texas where Fracking is very prevelent and just north of us it has now been linked to earthquakes in oklahoma. Â This added aspect of the game would make it to where the Â player has to utilized the ""raise land feature"" where as before one can progress through the game without having to use this, it adds another risk factor but also makes necessary to use another tool of prevention to risk."182.72.15.99,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Risk management is the strategy necessary for sustainable development and progress to next level in the game. There are strategies and trade-offs involved in the game which is pretty similar to the real world. I am going summarize my game strategies and trade-offs in this essay.First, Â I started the game building 3 plots even though I am capable of building total of 5. I kept the money as savings to rebuild or improve part of Alora that generates income quicker which can be used to develop further. The constant generation of income is important to the rising economy to build and sustain the development. Then, during the development process I chose to research. If the research indicates that a calamity. I stopped the research started investing in the protection against the calamity.Â Second, Even though I reached level 5 in 5 attempts, I played the game about 10 times because it was fun. The main things I learned during the first 5 games include: develop Alora strategically, look out for comets that is invest time in research, and buy insurance if you know you can't avoid the calamity or if you are not confident enough that you can not rebuild on your own. First time, I ignored research to concentrate on development, which taught me the importance of research. Second, I researched but didn't invest in protection, thinking that insurance would pay off, but the time run off by the time I rebuilt the whole thing. Third time, I pretty much balanced all 4 major areas: development, research, insurance and protection. Fourth and Fifth times I just got better at the game which is pretty good feeling.Â Third, Yes, Game indeed captures four major sectors for sustainable development: development, research, protection and insurance. If I have the opportunity to change one simple thing that would be to reduce the incidence of comets, in the real world we won't get that many disasters, and not comets for sure. The place where I live in or my parents live in, drought is the main disaster. We should add food and reserves for disasters such as drought and famine.Â Finally, summarizing my thoughts on the risk Horizon game. The game teaches important features such as research and development. But, game lacks few features such as food reserves or health hazards etc., which represent disasters of the developing countries or the countries where the famine or health are issues. In any case I sent the web link to my friends to spread the good word and intentions.Â "59.152.197.222,0.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The â€œRisk Horizonâ€œ game captures someessential concepts in real risk management case such as the identification,research, and prioritization of risks by making the best decision inco-ordination and allocation. The role of risk management in the game is to establishthe practicable internal practice and procedures o tackle risks of the planetwhich mainly came from falling comets. The procedures such as the risk responseprocess and plan before and after the damages came. And one of the mostimportant messages is to balance the growth and risk preparation. In the game, whilethe community is growing, its risk management tools include implementation ofprotection, research and insurance. The player must fully aware of the choicesof applying knowledge, securing protection or entering into insurance.Resources are limited. The player should always aware of the availableresources to maximize the output and minimize the risk incurred at the sametime. It is always a rule whenever the player to decide for one action, it willcost the player and reduce the possibility of arranging other action. Exampleas I did research to the coming comets, no time to grow the community. In mostcases, I spent the money in insurance, level up the land or research, lessmoney could be allocated in other aspects in term of protection or development.It is a matter of trade-offs as the time will not stop to wait for the fullpreparation of risk and it is always the falling comets to create differentdamages to the developed buildings. Risk preparation cost time and money whichthey are all core factors to foster the development of the community. Theplayer allocates their money to build the pods and will become lack ofsufficient money to purchase insurance or raise security level.In the beginning, the primary strategy wasto foster growth and develop as many as pods to sustain the cash flow andbrilliant future. However, it is totally wrong as proved by the damages broughtby the comets afterward. Definitely, balance must be considered betweenprotection and development. Thus, when it is the second times to play the game,more conservative act will be implemented such as to purchase more insuranceand reduce the development speed. The balance and progressive development isvery important. After several trials, it was clearly a main lesson brought outthat development is not everything; it should be in line with other balancedevelopment strategy such as the precautions.This game captures some risk managementelements, if it is to add more functions; one of critical part is to add humanbeings in the game. As human beings could always be a driving or destructivefactor to everything. It could be very necessary exercise to involve this realitythat human may sometimes bring drawbacks to the incident due to politicalreasons. Just like it was happened in some place with serious problem ofpoverty, the role of the officials to put forth necessary precautionary stepsto the affected area as the first and foremost plan in all risk managementissues, but corruption of officials lead to the program became insufficientfinancial support of the local assistance program and end up the failure ofthose projects are not rare things happened in real world."217.172.29.109,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"Risk management was important in terms of evaluating thepotential risk and severity of the meteor strikes and how to mitigate thedamage from strikes.Â  I personally reliedheavily on the research aspect, as this allowed me to ascertain to a greaterdegree the severity and likelihood of a strike.Â First, this allowed me make the decision as to whether the meteor was â€œworthâ€ùaddressing.Â  That is, if the severity wasvery low or it was not likely to strike, I could more or less ignore themeteor.Â  This allowed me to focus timeand resources on other more likely and / or severe meteors.Â  With the severe meteors, because of the timespent researching, I was able to react in the event of a strike and limit anypotential damage.Â  This meant that I hadto spend less time on protection, which ultimately led to me losing on level 5.Â  The damage that I suffered from a severe meteorstrike ultimately slowed my development too much for me to be able to reach thegoal.Â  With the time spent focusing onknowledge, I also may have neglected the protection aspect.Â  I might have better spent resources buildingup protection over time, rather than in response to an imminent meteor strike.I might focus more on protection and insurance if I were toplay again, though this might decrease development to such an extent that Imight lose earlier.Â  When I played, Itended to prioritize funds in the following order: development, knowledge,protection, and insurance.Â  This was aneffective strategy in the early levels, though perhaps as the severity of thestrikes get higher, it becomes more important to mitigate risk with insurancein order to lessen damage from the inevitable severe meteor strike.Â  This is perhaps analogous risk management inthe real world: countries must alter their risk management in the early stagesof development to address differing needs at various stages ofdevelopment.Â  For instance, countriesmight need to focus on development above all else, in order to address theneeds of the population.Â  As a countryprogresses through stages of development, it needs to shift it strategies toprepare for disasters and shocks, which may both impede future development andlead to greater net losses than in the earlier stages.Â  Finally, as a country reaches a highly developedstage, insurance and protection to ensure that all gains are protected becomesthe most important aspect.If I could add something to the game, I might add differenttypes of disasters as well as different types of development.Â  The differing types of development, perhapssocial, medical, science, etc. would help to increase the knowledgeaspect.Â  These would then be used toaddress the new types of disasters, perhaps things such as disease, famine,war.Â  This would add more of a â€œreal-worldâ€ùaspect to the game, though it would of course increase the games complexity.Â Â "212.142.103.100,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game is to find a balance between the cost of Â protection, insurance, knowledge, and coping and future growth cost and speed. Sometimes it seemed legit to stop developing and buy insurance instead. Watching the sky was very effectiveÂ during the game.Â In the beginning, I was overlyÂ protective. That lead to the situations whenÂ the village is save, but it have no resources for development. I bought 75% insurance before any riskÂ shows up on the horizon. That strategy showed that overly protective risk management leads to rapid delay in development. I changed my strategy step by step decreasing the amount of protection used, bought insurance only when the risk was high, and started to watch the sky more closely. This new strategy leaded to a bigger loss after hit of the comet comparing with previous one, but it proved itself showing faster development in theÂ future. After achieving 5th level,Â I decided to use the strategy more based on coping to see how its will turns out. Unlike the over protecting strategy, over risky strategy showed a fast grow at the beginning and huge loss with subsequent fall development speed. As I see after using these two contrary strategies over protecting strategy seem to be a better choice than over risky. Although it doesn't leave a lot of resourcesÂ for development, it doesn't put the object of the risk management in crisisÂ either. Â Â  The main thing I've learned from this game is that being overly protective takesÂ more time and resources and in the end it doesn't worth it. It could stop you almost completely from developing. Not taking action on the protection or future coping could lead to severe loss and even get you far away from the point you've started. Those conclusions totally makeÂ sense in the real life, too. So, as I think, before trying to avoid some risk or protect oneself or company from it, decision making person should compare real risk probability and future loss to the cost of risk avoidance in terms of protection and insurance cost. Not doing anything is worse than doing something wrong, at least you will know your mistakes and get better in the future.Â  Â In newÂ  gameÂ version, I would propose to include some useful stats at the end of the game such as development speed through the game. This would help to see clearly how the risk management effects development. Also, It would be handy to have well presented cost and benefits of making new podÂ building and upgrading it. More information on outcomes could be helpful for everyone.Â "75.66.149.137,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The role of risk management is critical to the game.

Hedging the investment against disaster works as long as the insurer is reputable.Trust is a major issue and must be addressed in incremental steps, there must be some monitoring of the issuers of policies in countries that do not have good fiscal oversight or policies of regulation.Countries committed to infrastructure development addressing specific needs, such as water shelters in Bangladesh, also require political stability.Community based interventions can be very effective when organized to reduce disaster damage and loss of life.Â  Populations that are marginalized often do not have the alternative to relocate and are allocated the most problematic development zones.The version of the game that I would develop, would offer multiple disasters that may or may not affect the village.Â  For example, a change of the terrain would alter flood destruction, an existing water course might be diverted with success,or drainage fields to stop water erosion."210.212.247.211,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  I really loved playing the game â€˜RiskHorizonâ€™. Initially, before the game started, I wondered how a game testingrisk management would be like. But after playing it, I realized that it wasboth interesting and informative. After playing this game one could clearlyunderstand and also experience the basic concepts of risk management and I alsodid. I clearly understood that one could not have knowledge, protection andinsurance completely with limited resources. Hence there must be trade-offs andthat too in an effective manner without losing the balance for development. InitiallyI relied on the knowledge and protection and completely neglected spending oninsurance but I couldnâ€™t even cross level 3 by doing so. Then instead ofprotection I went for insurance and compromised on protection. The results werethe same as the previous which made me realize that both protection andinsurance are two important parameters of risk management and cannot becompletely compromised by one another. The game is so practical that completeknowledge offers more time to have community links that could save the economy.I practically experienced how coping could reduce damage. The game alsostressed the fact that preparation without proper coping and coping without proper preparation are both uselessÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thegame made me to go for different strategies to survive more levels. Initially Isimply developed protection and insurance but failed to develop the pods. Thenext time when I tried to develop the pods, I ran out of resources as I madethe same mistake by simply increasing the protection which made me go out of balancewhich is needed for a proper development. Initially I spent valuable time onresearching on comets which are less severe and couldnâ€™t find time to researchon comets which are highly severe. This made me understand that if two or moreproblems approach us at the same time we must be able to prioritize them so asto attain minimal loss. I also learned to manage time as to spend time on researchingwhen Iâ€™m not developing pods or increasing protection.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I lovedthe game so much that I would really love to develop the game by introducingmigration concept to the game if possible, so that one could also learn someconcepts like when to migrate in search of better opportunities which couldreally take this game to a higher level of strategy. Migration can be implementedby splitting areas as coastal to non coastal areas.Â  The pods at the coast must be prone to moredamage at the same time must give more resources that others at the interiorpart though both are in same level. The migration must take some time andresource to occur. When they were hit during migration the damage caused mustbe at the maximum than when at the shore so that one could decide when tomigrate carefully.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I hopeeveryone loved the game very much like I did."89.3.202.255,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The game provides an interesting, though oversimplified, application ofrisk management.

For instance, at some point,when investment in protection has proved sufficient to efficiently shieldbuildings from floods, insurance is not much of a factor any more. Again, thegoal is to develop, not to indulge in a spending frenzy over protection andinsurance. Research stands apart from the two other variables, in so far as itis free (which is absolutely not the case in real life). I mostly used researchas a pastime to fill in the gaps, when I was waiting for money to add up.Iplayed the game three times in a row, and I got much better at appreciating theright level of protection and insurance needed, on a par with the expectedseverity of impacts. In doing so, I was able to exceed the expectations of eachlevel and see the green bar fill up rapidly. I understood that costly upgradesare not worthy unless the overall development of buildings is balanced - betterhave many average buildings than a few good ones. And while a responsible riskmanager cannot rely on fate alone, I also realized that luck is paramount, asthe number of comet hits vary from one to four per turn! My strategycould be summed up as follows: build all pods as soon as possible in order to raise mney quickly, invest ininsurance to the max, then, in upper levels, focus on development and protection,leaving insurance on the side when protection is sufficient. With this scheme of maneuver, you may be able to reduce the impact of risk management investments on your development.I live in a place that is, luckily, not prone to natural disasters. Nevertheless, I can think of a few simple ways the game could be changed in order to better representrisk management choices. First, comet hits should result in earthquakes as wellas floodings. Therefore, elevation would not prevent all damages, and insurancewould be necessary to recover from the hits. Then, research should be paid for,as in real life. Research is nothing like looking at the stars, it needs a realcommitment. For example, the player could build a telescope and upgrade it inorder to better assess the risk of impact. And finally, research shouldn't betoo accurate - varying weather conditions from one level to the other couldimpair the capability to track comets. Overall, the player would have to mixeven more all three variables to succeed in his or her quest for development.Riskhorizon is a funny approach to a handful of risk management principles. A true example of thewidespread gamification in nowadays education, it provides a swift look at the necessary balance between development and risk management investments. Its simplicity makes it quite intuitive,but after a few tries, the interest for our little pods Â fades away. I would gladly try a renewedversion with more difficulties to handle.Â Thinking of other games involving risk management,I would recommend SimCity for those who wish to see their developmentstrategies face a myriad of risks, ranging from natural disasters to chemicalpollution and even crime."217.73.129.9,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of the risk management in the game was to avoid loss. I think I needed some time before I could understand the game and its elements i.e. knowledge,protection and insurance. My choices were trade-offs combined with guess work. If you combine the three elements and keep them under command (which is difficult) you could go to higher level. I hardly reached the third level! Was it for my mistake or maybe something was wrong with the game? I am not sure. Maybe both. The most important thing in risk management is the preparation we get to face it, and our preparation sometimes can have very good affects, that can be immediate or even after some time.If I played the game only once, I would have finished maximum the first level. I played the game more than once and could surpass level two, which I consider a success for me. There was something wrong with the game, most probably yes.I can not say what I did differently the second time, but I think I followed the same intuitions as the first time. What was the main thing I learned from the game?I think I learned a lot: how difficult it is to be in control of all elements necessary for managing risk. The more you know, the better it is. Maybe what was missing in the game was the collaboration between actors, just as it happens in real life. Coordination of actions becomes very important in catastrophic situations.As explained above, I had problems with the game. Sometimes you could not understand where Â you made a mistake. What we really do (in this game and similar games) is reaction, reaction to an action,which in our case was natural phenomenon. So you can win if you react in time and intensity, and each game should give you these two possibilities.

It has been demonstrated that effective risk monitoring needs to estimate severity and possibility of damage and compare them with cost of insurance and preparation in order to determine how much to invest in defense, but not to overrate the potential risk. If potential risk is overrated, and to much is paid for preparation, development is delayed. Obtaining knowledge about potential risks, damage and overall impact is crucial for the proper assessment of the required prevention and protection steps. Also, very important issue is recovery after serious damage, fast reaction decreases loss of not making development because of dealing with negative effects. This was not an easy task, while playing the game there was a lot of situations when right decision needs to be made quickly, and there is no second chance.

We had to make various decisionsthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming cometswere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the cometâ€™sseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as researchtime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take actionto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,it can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level ofprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect theplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance anddevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching ahigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In thebeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and usingthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase infinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way thatit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance andprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actuallylessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances ofhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet throughobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according tothe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not causetoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protectAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role inreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one hasto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower thecosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on thephysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutivetime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better thatis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I wouldpropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to thecontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relativelyfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given thissituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions withlimited and slower growing financial resources."71.95.136.51,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,1.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"1) Â Risk management clearly required a balance of the all 4 aspects of risk management as the lectures and readings outline: Â Knowledge, Protection, Insurance, Coping all of which cost valuable resources and time which detracted from development. Â I focused on aggressive development spending while continuously tracking the comet threats that had the worst severity, the highest chance to hit, and those which moved fastest through the sky. Â Once I had identified the most prominent threats, I tried to build up my protection level to match that of the largest/most likely threat or I would buy insurance against it at the last possible moment. Â I reached the end of level 5 many times but lost with only small increments left to go on my development bar, which means that I ultimately wasn't spending enough on development in relation to the insurance, protection, and coping aspects. Â Additionally, by being persistent with researching at all possible times, I increased my ""community connections"" which allowed me to escape damage countless times.2) Â The second and third times that I played the game, I increased my spending on development and reduced my spending on insurance as insurance rarely seemed to pay off especially in levels 1-3. Â At times, it seemed like the comets would hit my colony at much higher rates than they were advertised when I researched each threat which was frustrating. Â I do understand that sometimes luck is not in ones favor repeatedly though it seemed to be that way more times than chance would actually allow in real life. Â Ultimately, a balanced and high capacity multi tasking and management was what was needed, as well as some good luck, in order to make it past level four. Â Patience was another key factor needed to make it to that level.3) Â As far as what I would have changed in the game, the insurance was almost prohibitively expensive as it seems to be at times in real life. Â Not only was it expensive, but if you play the game correctly, especially in the first four levels, it is almost a point less purchase. Â That being said, the insurance money that I spent could have been used to progress my development more in order to meet the overall level requirement that I seemed to have missed just by a hair at the end of level five.Ultimately this game was quite fun and I found myself playing it several times more that I thought I would have."27.124.11.53,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  The game of risk management.Â The game which has been organised by coursera to provide us with the insights of risk management has successfully done its work. The game required us to build more and more bots and protect them from comets heading towards them which could cause them damage. We had to cope with the damage caused by those comets by employing a mix of the three major strategies-1)Insurance2)Development3)CopingInsuring the bots helped us to lessen the cost of repairs when they are damaged.The compensation offered for repairing was available in three plans 25%,50% and 75%.THe 75% plan being the most expensive.Â Development raised the level of all the bots to a certain height and thus protected them from the damage which could have occurred.However, the more the platform is raised the more cost is required to raise them further.Coping involved repairing the bots once the damage has actually been done on the bots.It required money to repair them however if any insurance plan was taken the cost was compensated by the insurance company.Our main task in the game was to make a balance of the above mentioned 3 things so as to minimize the Â cost and also keep the bots working so as to fill up the meter and clear the level.When i played the game for the first time i didn't spend any amount on the insurance so i had to spend huge sums on repairing the bots.I was able to clear the first two levels but failed in the third level because a comet struck and i had no money to repair them.I realized tha i should have spent some amount on insurance as well.The next time i played the game i bought a 75% insurance cover so the cost of repairing the bots when the damage occurred was reduced by huge extent and i was able to cope up and successfully cleared the 3rd level.However in the fifth level i failed may be because i didn't spend much amount on development .But my performance improved a lot as compared to the first attempt and i was able to manage the risk better as compared to the first attempt."41.184.64.118,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management is the identification, assessment, andprioritization of risk, in the game I was expected to develop the community topotential in the area of providing the social amenities and taking into recordand cognizance the level of exposure the community stands and the necessarysteps required as to ensure the entire population is secured and protected. ThoughI didnâ€™t exceed the second level of the game even though I tried, during thegame, I ensure to take insurance policy for my community to cushion the effectof natural disasters and also investigate the nature of storms which will hitmy community from time to time to enable me rectify the damages. I played thegame severally and noticed, trying to protect my community from natural disastercost more and I ended up spending most of the money on that process and sorebuilding the community was always impossible. And I decided to change thepattern of approach by first investigating the nature of storm and followingthe researcherâ€™s advice on how to advert it. I noticed that sometimes theresearcherâ€™s prediction was not always correct and I do well to invest more oninsurance and develop my community but before long there is a big hit again andthe devastation is great and I observe my insurance and money at hand canâ€™tcover for the repair and others. The stimulation is obviously a good one thoughon real life issues it might not be applicable, so I suggest a more real time scenariocould help improve the game. Take for example the game of chess, monopoly etc.it gives you plenty of time to think, plan, strategies and observe which is notpresent in our game. If we were given time to pounder and carefully put ourplans to better perspective we will surely make better input and significantchange on the game. In the area of making choices on what could help thecommunity growth to potential was always difficult based on the absences ofsome instruments and that kept me in the dark on decision making, I held onlythe insurance to fall back on, based on the insurance policy outlay to mitigatedamages which was not enough strategies to control risk. The orientation alsowas not condensed enough to get a first timer around and about the game, especiallyin the aspect of risk sharing, I really couldnâ€™t share risk with othercommunity and that impacted grossly on my ability to perform intelligently.Implementation follows all of the planned methods for mitigating the effect ofthe risks. Purchase insurance policies for the risks that have been decided tobe transferred to an insurer, avoid all risks that can be avoided withoutsacrificing the entity's goals, reduce others, and retain the rest. It isimportant to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floors, earthquakes,and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable whenconsidering future repair costs, business interruption losses and otherdowntime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costsof reducing the risk. But I obviously appreciate the effort of the designer andalso those that put this program together, the effort they made the niche theycreated and more importantly the superb intelligent exhausted to be bring thiscreativity to potential. Io hope they keep up to this wonderful work and researchthat is grossly informative to help us not only managing natural disaster butalso knowing the numerous risk we face in the face of severe challenges thatcan harm our effort towards our prosperity.

Its role can be outlined asbelow:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To ensure long-term survival of the community ofAloraÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To provide immediate protection and relief fromshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insuranceÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To ensure timely and justified protection at thetime of crisisÂ Important choices had to be made for each crisis accordingto its severity. Due to limited resources, it wasimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimumutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching theisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basisof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance ofa hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I wouldimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gatherknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal insafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, beingcomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making atrade-off between risk and resources, I wasable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.While making preparations for the shock, again atrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due tolimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted sothat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would notupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buyinsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on developmentdue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain moreresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resourceswas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoidedby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of developmentslowed down the process of growth of resources.Â Having played the game more than once, I learnt certainvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.Initially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize therisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized thatdevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick paceto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary toprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, Ibegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordinglyspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community againstthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive thebarrage of incoming comets. This game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-worldcrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of timemanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct andjustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.Â Hailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize thatcorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequatesocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in riskmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a justand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice toall citizens of the community.Â "109.185.164.90,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Hello!I think that everybody wants to develop. You start the game with financial resourced to build the community. And you do. But, as you are aware of the risk of flooding, you start community protection. Everything goes smooth until you see the comet. Now it's time for research and taking actions up-front. As the game time is limited and the comet is coming, you have a moment to decide what is best to be done. Either you buy insurance of smaller coverage or a bigger one in the case of high severity comet, or you can invest in development of the community in the case of low probability to be hit by the comet and flooding as well. Preparation for risk helps to develop. And the results are seen after some time.Wrong choice brings flooding with damage.

Some communities have suffered after the flood year after year. The habitants are not willing to relocate to a safer place because of the lack in the financial resources. The state also lacks resources to help all of them. Although the warning about the flood possibility is announced, people are not taking necessary actions. As it was mentioned in this course that people prefer to think that ""this will happen to someone else, not to me"". So we need to change people's way of thinking. It is much easier to blame the state for not helping after the flood, instead of taking actions after the warning.As for the game, I would propose to add another risk like an earthquake.

I found that in order to achieve success, I had to prepare for that occurrence, and invest in insurance, even if it seemed to be Â a loss at that moment. I gladly gave up knowledge and was happy to slow down the development of the pods in order to make sure that I had the best kind of insurance that I could afford at any given time, knowing that even though the probability of being hit hard was not that big, it only takes one heavy blow to make me lose the game. One of the features that would make the game more realistic would be to not take the whole amount that is due for building or upgrading right after you've selected it, but gradually. It would be more realistic to be asked for an initial investment, that would be a portion of the total cost, and then the balance to be taken as the building progresses.

First, I did not know the setting, so I had to learn how things worked there. Second, I had to find the right balance between protection and insurance.

As stated above, I had to discover the right trade-offs for both immediate survival and long-term development. The first times I used most of my resources for protection and insurance, but I noticed that such a behavior would drive me to get stuck in the third or fourth level most of the times. By managing risk in an aggressive way, I burnt resources that would be necessary for building. Sometimes I ran out of money, so development was suddenly interrupted, and sometimes I spent so much time building protection that I could not finish the buildings on time. Those situations made me realize that I had to moderate my strategy and diversify the tactics involved, so I started to monitor the sky in a closer way. I noticed that by doing that I activated the community, which worked as a kind of insurance. It was not so costly as insurance and it did not consume my development, as protection did. Anyway, I had to combine the three tactics while keeping an eye on the development progress bar and calculated how a specific kind of growth at a level would affect next steps. I started to save some money from one phase to the next and tried to build just as much as necessary, so that growth was effectively sustainable. I also noticed that I could take advantage of calm moments to build protection. Since protection building demanded quite a lot of time, working on it was easier when the sky was reasonably clear. This was easier during the first levels and, since protection was transferred from one level to the next, I decided that I wouldÂ buildÂ most of it during levels 1 and 2. I tended to stop at 3/4 of the bar because it was possible to complement the protection with community links and insurance. If even taking all due care I was hit, I tried to fix the buildings ASAP, in order to be able of go on growing and upgrade the buildings. As I got more experienced, I stopped using insurance at the first levels of the game. I preferred to invest in it at more advanced levels, when I had a reasonable amount of buildings to be protected. I only got to complete the game once the strategy was clear in my mind, I had some experience and learnt how to combine the managing tactics smoothly.If I had to add some element to the game I would choose some kind of stamina. I imagine there is a psychological stress involved in risk management, which tends to worsen as time goes by and crises get more severe. It would be a human touch for the game."103.26.193.20,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was immense for the game. Thegame centered around managing funds which needed to go into both developmentand risk management. One would need to devote most of their resources towarddevelopment to meet the goals assigned by the game but to also defend againstthe attacks with either preparation i.e. protection or coping i.e. insurance. Itreflects risk management in real life by putting development thresholds thatneed to be surpassed instead of focusing purely on the risk itself. As in reallife when economic and social development are put first. Whilst playing thegame I was confronted by multiple trade-offs. I had decided to follow theadvice of the course instructors and sought active risk management in this caseincreasing protection to the level necessary to protect the pods. Riskpreparation immediately affected development by restricting the funds necessaryto build or upgrade pods. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I playedthe game two times. The first time I played I bought insurance while the secondtime I did not. I actually spent less on knowledge but more on developing thepods. The development goals were rather demanding and required the lionâ€™s shareof resources just as in real life. The main things I learned from the game werethat only near maximization of resources would be sufficient to meetdevelopment goals while at the same time defending against crises. Carefulplanning is also required. Knowledge is also important for actively preventingcrises. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If I wereto change one thing about the game it would be to increase uncertainty.Uncertainty about both the resources put into development and the crisesthemselves. As stated in the lectures a primary reason actors put too littleresources into risk management is that crises are relatively few and farbetween in most parts of the world. For example in my country, Mongolia naturaldisasters and social upheaval (although economic crises are common) are veryuncommon leading policymakers and individuals to assume that risk isnonexistent or far into the future. In addition to this many times resourcesput towards development never achieve their stated goals be it corruption,mismanagement, or environmental factors. If the game had much more uncertaintyin resource investment in both protection and uncertainty about the crises itwould be more realistic. For example protection being needed less anddevelopment having a chance of failing. Oftentimes even the most well planned out programs fail due to mismanagement or corruption in the operational level.Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â "187.252.110.223,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,-36.0 to 1.0,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,11.0 to 46.0,"Risk Management Game.The game is a web-based simulation that conveys a risk environment of threatening meteorites that will crash on the planet and destroy the city your are placed.

Once I had the money I invested it on building bigger houses and that would give me more money, but I was always watching the skies to learn about the meteorites, I prepared myself with the suficient protection for every meteorite, not one line more not one less, and also It did not matter if it was going to crash with our planet or not; using that strategy, buying policies was not necesary, not even once, therefore the money was always in use of protection or investment, preparation is essencial to survive to the end of the game, and you can only do that If you are well aware of what is happening in the skies and preparing with the enough protection, not more not less.I played the game two times, for the first one, I tried to protect myself too much that my economy was not enough to pass through the fourth level, because my protection was always at the maximum level.

The severity of damage is influenced by the type of meteor collision, the degree of preparedness through research and community links, and the financial and structural resilience. Although meteors vary in their impact, the risk of frequent collisions is a predictable natural disaster, much like the annual monsoon floods experienced in Bangladesh. The game showed that despite being able to forecast the risk, it is difficult to recover fast enough after each shock to develop and build coping strategies for the next shock.In this model, knowledge was gained by the time-consuming process of studying meteors, which was at the expense of spending time developing the community. Judgements had to be made about which meteors posed the greatest threat, and resources allocated proportionately.Â Protection was offered from better building infrastructure (upgrading pods) and better community connections (through shared knowledge). Insurance was helpful for coping with the financial costs of repair after a shock, but cannot prevent the damage happening in the first place. All these approaches to risk management had to be balanced within time and money constraints.What would you do differently?In the first couple of rounds I was still learning how to play the game, since the instructions were not particularly clear. Once I understood how to build connections in the community, I invested more time in researching the meteors to facilitate this. When I reached level 3, I also began to understand the importance of upgrading buildings for resilience, so I experimented with focusing on having fewer, higher quality buildings. I did not try the game enough times to determine if this strategy was more successful.I played the game several times, but was never able to get above level 3. Eventually I became frustrated at my inability to learn and improve, and quit trying. I suppose in the real world this would correspond to leaving a high risk enterprise, or a leadership role in an at-risk country, if I was unable to cope with shocks. If I had the option, I would seek knowledge and feedback from people who had played the game before.Â What changes would you propose?The game is very much a unilateral approach to risk management, and I felt I was making decisions in isolation. I would prefer there to be an option to consult the community that lives on the planet for their views (which would also be a more accurate reflection of dealing with incentives and behavioural barriers to risk management), and also to consult expert colleagues (and learn from the experiences of other planets?) I would also like to be able to gain knowledge on my game playing strategy beyond simply the meteor statistics given, so that I could figure-out how to improve."81.164.29.88,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The role was that of making decisions about how to use resources to enhance the development of the island. It was necessary to set priorities of two main resources- time and money, either to prepare for disasters (comet hits) or to build up a more prosperous communities (building up pods). The preparation for the disasters involved also different phases, first researching on how probable and how severe would a comet hit be; second deciding upon lifting the island to protect the pods according to that impact equation; and third, purchasing an insurance to make reconstruction cheaper. It is interesting to see how although preparation for risk was achieved by ""lifting"" the island for protection, this measure reduced notoriously how well the ""development bar"" performed. Such a decision in the game gives me a very clear glimpse of what people and governments have to deal with when they seem not to make the ""obvious"" decisions of remaining on safe zones-- this is, focusing too much on protection would not allow enough investment in developing the pods.This has to do with the answer to the second question; the first times I played I failed in the first level. On the one hand because I did not realise how important it was to improve the pods (which means that as a decision-maker I missed key information about opportunities) and on the other hand because I did not manage time very well. So there is also an element here of learning as you fail; once I got the importance of not only making damage almost improbable but realised that it was necessary to take some risks and balance the budget to look for better outcomes, the results improved. And finally, there is an issue of cummulative preparation; developing the pods allows you to be better prepared for the future levels as you will have a higher revenue; buying an insurance is a time-constraint measure and you only make sure that reconstruction is not too expensive.And for the last question, I would allow the development of the pods to be done according to two options: one with a higher retun rate for the investment (let's say, industrial) and the other with less vulnerability to comet hits (let's say, agriculture), so the decisions upon whether or not to protect and whether or not to buy an insurance are correlated to a greater extent with those of how much time you have to achieve the development goal versus the need to mitigate the risks."203.122.57.220,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"1. The role of the riskmanagement in the game is to keep the right balance between all the componentsat the right time. The game also requires one to make preparations for the upcomingrisk by adopting various means. Through community linkage, the game alsoprepares one for coping Â Protection, Insurance research â€“ all of them were important. I made choices depending upon the severityof the comet. Insurance was must. Too much of research was not necessary, butsome research definitely helped. Protection was more or less continuous. Oncethere is a strike, community linkage helped. Sometimes while repairing the podsfunds reduced, so I could not buy the high price insurance resulting in highdamage. Preparations for risk helpedin reducing the impact of the comet strike. Having insurance beforehand helpedin spending less money on the repairing of the pods. For reducing the impactimmediately community linkage helped.2.Â  I played the game severaltimes, first failing at level 1, then level 2, then level 3 and then level 4.While playing the game more than once I understood different components betterand the relations between them. I tried to figure out when the comet strikesmost, but could not figure out. The risk of comet strike  damage thereof remaineduncertain throughout. Â After the first time Itried to gain information on each component, observed the time to reach each researchbar, checked the information bar for each comet, especially severity chances of strike. I also worked hard to protect the pods  raise the meterbar. Â The learnings from the gameare: -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To begin with it is veryimportant to have information on various factors that can affect the impact ofthe risk â€“ both positively  negatively. In the game it is about theseverity of the comet strike, chances of strike, research need, cost ofinsurance, etc.-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â It is always better to knowmore about the risk coming so that you get prepared for the impact. This alsohelps in coping.-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â One should not panic in anemergency situation. This may lead to more damage. In the game when more thanone comet comes at a time, then I got panicked. I moved from one action toanother, without completing one. This led to failure.-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Insurance helps a lot incoping. -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â There is only limitedresource, so balancing is very important. Â 3. I work for the health sector. Health insurance isa major component of my work. Getting the community to buy health insurance isa huge task. People do not seek health care till the later stage. They also do notgo for health insurance in spite of the knowledge they have on the benefits of healthinsurance even if they can afford it. So there is a need for behavior changeboth at the level of accessing health care at an early stage and have a healthinsuranceIn this context I would like to add the componentof behaviour change in the game. This should show how behaviour change leads tomore gain and prepares people to confront the risk and coping better.

It allowed me to make my choices and     decisions on the level of severity, the chance of the event to happen and     research to minimize uncertainty. In addition, I relied on available     resources and incentives or rewards. In fact, knowledge or information,     insurance and protection have also my considerations for preparation.     Preparation for risk affects development due to the fact that it uses     resources upfront for knowledge, protection and insurance therefore     diversion of some development resources for such preparation or interventions.     However, it benefits development as it helps to avoid or minimize the     adverse impact of the risk that may regress back the hard won development     and investments, social, economic and political advancements. On top of     that, the resource needed upfront for preparation as well as after the     event for relief, recovery and reconstruction is small if preparation is done     as risk management. In fact, assets, human capital, social cohesion, life     saved or protected. In addition, development path will not be     significantly affected by the event and my nation will be of its track     within a short period of recovery. In addition, in my role as a decision maker,     I learned the importance of integrated tools and coordinated intervention     of risk management institutions. This means, one toll or institution along     is no sufficient to ensure effective risk management. This prevents fragmented     and short sighted intervention and promotes harmonized and aligned intervention     of risk management. I would like to optimize the     balance between development and risk management investment (preparation as     well as coping). I mean, I allocate resource in a way that it will be optimally     used to maintain the development effort and invest on risk management to     protect such development and exploit opportunities to be emerged from such     risk management. Well, I would propose a sort of     indictor that represents availability of stable institutions that     responsible in dealing with effective risk management. It is well pronounced     in the course materials that one of the failures of effective risk     management is the absence of committed and stable institutions that apply     such risk management tools. If such institutions are in place, averting or     minimizing the adverse impact of the obstacles (misaligned incentives, Lack     of information for decision, unaccepted behavior, resource limitation)to     risk management possible when we say responsible, it means ethical and professional     in applying the reels and regulations. Otherwise, the financial crisis     that some times said to be emanated from unethical practices of management     and staff is damaging and even aggravates or contributes or become a cause     for risk and crisis promotion.In conclusion, I tried to apply or use the components of effective risk managementsuch as KnowledgProtectionInsurancecoping(recoveryand rehabilitation or reconstruction using sources generated form insurance,saving etc)Â Â "110.44.123.195,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â  Whatwas the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and whattrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or aftersome time)?Â The role of risk management in the game was protecting throughinsurance to recover from uncertainties and exposure of hazard. Knowledge isrequired for early recovery and insurances are required for minimizing losses.Depending upon the level of hazard and the likelihood of occurrenceof disaster, the research was conducted to minimize impact of hazard andrecover through insurances. The preparation of risk is important task, mostoften neglected but plays significant role in early recovery or minimum lossesif the disasters are unavoidable. Risk management is a trade-off betweenknowledge, protection and insurance, lots resources are required for knowledgewhich could setback development and protection but the resources for recoveryare less in comparison to actual losses. The appropriate insurances minimizeslosses and early recovery from disasters.Â 2.Â Â Â  If youplayed the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play itagain? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you dodifferently after the first time? What were the main things you learned fromthe game?The different choices of research, insurances, wise use ofresources were carried out with trial and error way. This task showed that disasterrisk management is a complicated and we have to deal with uncertainties. Risk managementis part of the development effort but it is inherent to development work sothat properties and lives are saved.Risk management averts damages and prevent development setbacks,provides opportunity to understanding the environment in which risk andopportunity are equally embedded and the focus should be to increaseopportunity. Reduce possibility of loss and increase possibility of gain.Risk management requires preparation and coping (updatingknowledge and deploying insurance and protection). Knowledge can increase protectionand insurance to cope with losses and get benefit.Â Â 3.Â Â Â  Thegame captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.

This was in an attempt toimprove the benefits of growth and prosperity for the pods with the aim ofgrowing and improving the benefits to the community. Â I made the choice to always make sure I boughtthe highest amount of insurance as possible, even if this meant increasing thenumber of pods at a slower rate. At first, a trade-off that I made in terms ofknowledge was that I did not understanding how to connect communities or theimportance of connecting communities to increase the development bar. In termsof protection, I therefore made the choice to forgo the use of communityconnections to increase my development bar, in exchange for a higher amount ofinsurance which I paid for with money. There were times, however, that I didhave to buy cheaper insurance as I could not afford the more expensiveinsurance whilst also growing pods. I initially found that I prepared too muchwith the purchasing of insurance and research and as a result, did not makeenough pods to win the first few games I played. If I played the game only once, I would focus less onprotection and insurance and more on growing more pods. I would also do moreresearch to enable me more time to build communities. This stems from the mainthing I learned from the game, which is the importance of including communityand strengthening community to ensure that if a risk does become a reality,there is a greater chance that the community will pull together, create a team Â and work together to survive. I alsoappreciated how people would be more willing to take more risks if they haveinsurance backing their actions and that taking more risks leads to greateropportunities to grow and develop. If I could change one thing in the game, I would involve theconcept of â€˜incentivesâ€™ which is an obstacle to managing risk. I would havedifferent scenarios which the game presents to the game player and require theplayer to choose an outcome.

However as I came to find that each impacted each other so all the activities had to be done together to ensure that I could move pass the level. At some points I chose to develop more or raise the city to its maximum as I thought that was best for the city at the point in time given the risks around. Preparing for the risks up front at the start of the game allowed continued Development as the city was not affect or was not affected as badly. It cost little to no money to recover from a disaster which meant that one could continue developing further and not spend the time and money repairing.I played the game multiple times, and generally I got further in the game each time. This happened as I learnt how to ensure I do all that was necessary to manage the risk. On my first try I was only concerned with developing which did not get me far. Then I was only concerned with the meteors that would do the most damage. So when there was a meteor that had a high severity and low change of impact I took all the time raising the city and in the end it missed. By the time I had reach level 6 of the game the main things I had really learnt was that in order to be successful one must be able to focus on multiple things at a time. You had to be aware of the meteors in the sky what the severity was and the chance of success. In addition you had forecast that if it hits it will lower your protection so your protection must be high enough to cover the one that is right be hind it cause you don't have time raise the protection or do more research. The importance of having your hands in different pots becomes very important on reflection in risk management. Â Overall it was a great game and if I had to make any improvements so that it could better represent Â the risk management choices that matter in the place I live I would try to make more human. The greatest risks where I lived are cause by humans mainly crime. So hindrance to development come from a more social aspect and not such a supernatural out of this world element. I think the natural disaster risks are important to manage but even in these they some times come down to the human risks. Imagine you build shelters but the food is stolen or destroyed. The greatest risk comes from Humans and that should be address in the game to make it even better.Â "72.80.111.60,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"The role of risk management in Risk Horizon is to facilitate thedevelopment of a pod community by implementing knowledge, protection, andinsurance components of risk preparation. The game challenges users to choosean individual or integrated group of components to appropriately use in a givencontext. This mission, in addition to dealing with limited funds and timeconstraints, represents the challenges of achieving optimal outcomes ofsuccessful risk management: to reduce the losses and increase the benefits thatcan occur in the presence of risk.Â  I played the game numerous times. My firstfew attempts consisted of failures within Level 1, during which I focused all expensesand time on creating a perfectly integrated system of preparation componentsthat could successfully manage the impact of shocks brought on by comet-causingwaves. Needless to say, I failed to manage the development of the pods beforemy finances dissipated and the time ran out. These various trials taught me thatunderstanding the goal of risk management is different from being able tosuccessfully implement it; I realized the complexity and vitality of finding abalance between fostering healthy development and preparing for risk. I purchased insurance at the beginning ofevery level; ensuring the presence of insurance served as a risk managementstrategy for any remaining uncertainty after the implementation of research and/orprotection. This reduced the necessity of spending too much on ensuringprotection and additionally allowed the development bar to continue rising. However, I was forced to confront some trade-offs between protectionand insurance when there was not enough time to wait for the island to rise tothe shock severity point. In these occurrences, the only option was to purchasethe highest rate of affordable insurance and hope there would not be anyremaining structural damages to fund.The research and knowledge component provedto be the most important member of the interlinked preparation strategy.Researching provided me with cash to fund development as well as the option toincrease protection through community connections. In some high-risk contexts,I was forced to confront a trade-off situation between the knowledge andprotection components. When the price of protection had risen dramatically and anappropriate rate of insurance was already purchased, time constraint forced meto allocate all remaining funds to community development. The only way to reducethe potential of loss was to substitute protection with research. Researching theapproaching comet for a prolonged period of time provided me with the chance to completenumerous community connections, therefore increasing protection and reducinglosses. Â If I could add something to Risk Horizon in the context of myhometown, I would make the island larger and have an element of the gameincorporate the risks associated with distance from the coast. I believe thatthis would add a realistic, yet simple, dimension to the understanding ofhealthy development and risk preparation.Â "27.125.146.30,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The game was designed simple yet educational. At the startof the game, it was apparent that the risk would be the destruction and harmbrought about when the comets hit the planet or shall we call it the locationof development. So to mitigate this risk, purchasing insurance and buildingprotection was imminent. However, players should learn that other risk surfacesas the game proceeds. An example of such risk was under investment to develop theplace. The risk of under-development is financial failure caused byinsufficient income generation. In the aspect of this game, the player wouldfail to reach the next level as he did not make enough income. In my opinion, after having played the game, the role ofrisk management in the game was to strike a balance between investing or takingopportunities, protecting and insuring. I usually trade off insurance for protectionat the beginning of the game as spending on protection is more cost efficientthan getting the higher level of insurance. And through experience, I believe buildingup resilience is very effective for dealing with the aftermath of disaster. Thedevelopments took lesser time to recover from the damage caused by the disasterwhen preparation was adequate. The ability to react fast and take action fastwas also very crucial. Preparedness and responsiveness could reduce the damagescaused by the disaster to the minimum. Nevertheless, I also believe in theadvice that a little goes a long way. For that reason, I purchase the minimumlevel of insurance even when the chances of being hit were low and the severityof destruction was also low. Having just sufficient insurance without over-spendingon it is also a key point in risk management.I played the games a numbers of times. The main things I didwhich were always different from the previous attempts were to try to strike abalance between investing (developing), insuring and protecting. Gaining theknowledge about the disasters that could strike was crucial as the steps takento mitigate the harm brought about by the disaster would depend on it. To maximizethe benefit of insurance, I build up my asset to earn enough income to purchasethe maximum level of insurance. Having the maximum insurance reduced thefinancial burden that I have to bear when harm was done by the disaster. Development should coincide with information gathered ondisaster. The right amount of development should come at a right timing. Developmentshould hold to a certain extent when there is information that a severedisaster in inevitable. This would reduce the cost for dealing with theaftermath of the disaster.If I were to improve the game, I would:Provide more information on disaster as the stages of thegame progress. (For example: Stage 2 information would be more available than stage1 and so on.) This is because the main thing that would upset the progress ofdevelopment is the strike of disaster. As in real life, I believe that pastevents would build up the experience in managing risks. More information shouldbe available as time goes by. Information is of paramount important in riskmanagement. The improvement on information provision would enable players to knowin advance the probable damage caused by the disaster and thus plan for therequired insurance and protection. "134.96.78.119,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"In the game, risk management makes it less likely to be hit by a disaster, and made the negative consequences of disasters less severe. I made the choice to invest early in insurance, then in knowledge and finally in protection, which means that I made a trade-off in between those various sorts of risk management approaches. Preparation for risk affected development insofar as it slows down development in terms of the time one can devote to it and the money available to development.I played the game several times. After the first time, I invested more in risk management. What I learned from the game is that being willing and prepared to invest in risk management, and prioritizing such investments is necessary but not enough - much is still left to chance. For example, if one is hit by a disaster just before the time of the level is up, then one can't really win the level because there is insufficient time after the disaster to repair, and this is the case even if investments in risk management has been maximal.If I was tasked to develop a new version of the game, I would add the political dimension of risk management - it is frequently politically expensive for elected officials to invest in long term risk management, while election cycles are typically short.Â Â "76.98.233.44,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was to prepare for impending damage, suffering or loss. Further, it helped to properly manage the damage, suffering, and loss due to unseen or foreseen events. Knowledge was useful when advancing to the next round because it helped to make key decisions in choosing insurance over elevation of the island or conducting research to further gain protection against an asteroid hit. So, I mostly relied on insurance and knowledge to advance through the game. Protection by elevation of the island was time consuming and easily lost if there was significant damage from an asteroid hit. Plus, research I feel provided a better option for protection. Preparation for risk helped to rebuild in reasonable amount of time due to the level of advancement of the colony. The more moderate homes were cheaper and took less time to rebuild compared to the more advance ones. However, the greater the development of the colony the more points and options I was able to gain in order to advance to the next round. So, that was a trade off as well I think in playing the game.Â It took me numerous tries to advance to second level and beyond each time learning more about the game until I was able develop a routine to ensure advancement and quickly repair my colony. I found that purchasing insurance right away and building a few homes was valuable to continue playing the game. Mainly, what I learned from the game is that there is no full proof protection plan that will ward off any type of risk. Risk or calamity is very real and part of our lives everyday so its important to consciously realize that and not ignore it. I think its more dangerous to believe that an individual can somewhat predict the level of risk that on may be subject and therefore not adequately prepared for it.I would implement an evacuation plan to the risk management plan. I feel that losing loved ones has a longer effect on an individual than losing possessions. Material possessions can replaced and rebuilt but losing someone that hurts more and that same sentiment should a priority and responsibility of the governing body. Urging people to leave when the risk to great is important especially if there are systems in place to effectively plan for such impending events that have the ability to cause much damage.Â "115.66.95.156,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â Â The primary role of risk management in the gamewas to mitigate the effects of impeding shocks to ensure developmental goals are achieved in the stipulated time.Â I madethree key decisions at the start of the game:a.Â Â Â Â Â Â Always buy insurance at the start of each levelas I knew I would not have enough time to build protection while ensuring Imeet the developmental goals.b.Â Â Â Â Â Development was always kept at â€˜yellowâ€™ on thedevelopment gauge and when it turned â€˜greenâ€™, I would channel resources tobuild protection.c.Â Â Â Â Â Â Dedicate time to research as it provided meaccurate information on the chance of being hit and whether my existingprotection was sufficient to mitigate the likely severity of the impact.Buildingprotection potentially jeopardises development as it channels resources awayÂ immediately. However, ensuring there is adequate protection and insurance is essential as itÂ not only reduces the damage inflicted but it reducesthe recovery time when a comet hits.2.Â Â Â Â Â Â After playing the game once, I realised thatinsurance must be re-purchased at the start of each level while protection canbe accumulated across levels. Therefore, it is highly favourable to ensure protectionis built during every level and to have it accumulate to an adequate point tomeet the average severity of the comets at that level. Â  Â  Â Fromthe example above, I gained one key learning that there is need to build astrongÂ foundation for riskmanagement with the view to continually build upon the existingÂ infrastructure for further protectionand security.Â Anotherkey learning is to be realistic and accept the fact that I cannot pursue everythingÂ simultaneously. I need to ensurethere is adequate protection for my â€˜podsâ€™ but not at theÂ expense of not meeting mydevelopmental goals. Thus, my risk management plan needsÂ comprise of all three components of research(knowledge), protection and insurance atÂ varyinglevels to help cope with the threats and damage of the comets.Lastly,I also learnt the importance of maintaining a reserve in view of an impendingshock.Â Despite having insuranceand protection, there is still a strong need to have resources afterÂ the shock to ensure recovery time is atits minimum so that development can resume quicklyÂ as before.3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Two suggestions to the game which might made thechoices more realistic:a.Â Â Â Â Â Â With increased research, make protectioncheaper. One cost of protection which might or might not have been taken intoaccount is the cost of convincing people for the need of the protection. Thereason for this cost is covered in the lecture videos relating to behavioural biasnessof communities and people. With more research, there would be more informationand justification to the recommended protection or risk management initiatives.b.Â Â Â Â Â Understanding the short term view of people ingeneral, the cost of protection should vary with the time from the last impact.After a string of â€˜missesâ€™ of comets, protection cost should increase as itwould be more difficult to convince people to dedicate resources to protectiongiven that they are likely to have â€˜forgottenâ€™ about its negative effects.Reversely, it should be cheaper to invest in protection when an impact has just occurred as people would require less convincing.Â "47.17.175.100,6.0 to 10.0,0.0 to 2.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â Risk management in the game will never beperfect. Practice, experience, and actual loss results will necessitate changesin the plan and contribute information to allow possible different decisions tobe made in dealing with the risks being faced.Risk analysis results andmanagement plans should be updated periodically. There are two primary reasonsfor this:1.Â Â Â Â Â  to evaluate whether the previouslyselected security controls are still applicable and effective2.Â Â Â Â Â  to evaluate the possible risk levelchanges in the business environment. For example, information risks are a goodexample of rapidly changing business environment.Riskmanagement identifies a new type of a risk that has a 100% probability ofoccurring but is ignored by the organization due to a lack of identificationability. For example, when deficient knowledge is applied to a situation, aknowledge risk materializes. Relationship risk appears when ineffectivecollaboration occurs. Process-engagement risk may be an issue when ineffectiveoperational procedures are applied. These risks directly reduce theproductivity of knowledge workers, decrease cost-effectiveness, profitability,service, quality, reputation, brand value, and earnings quality. Intangiblerisk management allows risk management to create immediate value from theidentification and reduction of risks that reduce productivity. Risk managementalso faces difficulties in allocating resources. This is the idea ofopportunity cost. Resources spent on risk management could have been spent on moreprofitable activities. Again, ideal risk management minimizes spending (ormanpower or other resources) and also minimizes the negative effects of risks.Â The game captures are an innovation of risk management.Innovation is an important topic in the study of economics, business,technology, sociology, and engineering. Colloquially, the word""innovation"" is often used as synonymous with the output of theprocess. Since innovation is also considered a major driver of the economy, thefactors that lead to innovation are also considered to be critical to policymakers.In the organizational context, innovation may be linked to performance andgrowth through improvements in efficiency, productivity, quality, competitivepositioning, market share, etc. All organizations can innovate, including forexample hospitals, universities, and local governments.While innovation typically adds value, innovation may also have a negative ordestructive effect as new developments clear away or change old organizationalforms and practices. Organizations that do not innovate effectively may bedestroyed by those that do. Hence innovation typically involves risk. A keychallenge in innovation is maintaining a balance between process and productinnovations where process innovations tend to involve a business model whichmay develop shareholder satisfaction through improved efficiencies whileproduct innovations develop customer support however at the risk of costlyRD that can erode shareholder return.""Innovation, like many business functions, is a management process thatrequires specific tools, rules, and discipline.""The Innovation Equation she developed is:Innovation = Creativity * Risk TakingUsing this inventory it is possible to plot on axis where individuals fit ontheir Risk Taking and Creativity."123.237.21.82,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Hello all,The role of risk management is clearly defined in the game as it deals with the development of the community ""Alora"", taken into consideration some risks that is assigned with the comet attacks and some trade offs which are there in the form of protection, insurance and knowledge. Trade offs are there because of the limited resource MONEY, that automatically increases with its own pace. So while playing the game you need to keep in mind the basic idea of how risk management should be conducted?. that is Preparation and Coping. While preparing you need to carefully and critically analyse the situation as to where to allocate the money and what should be the quantity that needs to be allocated across different options. Also you need to keep in mind the basic goals of risk management that is to be resilient and to achieve prosperity. One of the most important observation in the game is the development bar. It is quite interesting Â that the development bar only fills up when the player is trying to develop the communityÂ ""Alora""Â and is not stick to the resilient concept. So it clears out the two basic objectives of risk management. When I first played the game I was trying to build the whole community at once and thus was failing in allocating much required amount in insurance, protection and knowledge. Then In the next try I tried the systematic approach of going step by step and did every action in line with another, as a result development bar started climbing up, a relaxing moment after a long time trying. Every level seemed easy then, a nice way of learning. The crux of risk management were clearly depicted in the game. I am a student in University of Delhi doing Economics H so i will design a game involving risk of the students and their trade offs. In my game the LIMITED RESOURCE money will be replaced by Time, the trade offs will be Studies, Friends, Activities. The COMETS will be the Exams or may be results of activities. And the ultimate goal as it was the development of the community of ""Alora"" in the game it will be the overall development of a student so that he or she gets a good placement at last. So the students will need to judiciously allocate limited time to various activities so that the Placement bar fills up and let them win in the game as well as in the life too. In that way the game will carry a decent message too."80.4.174.17,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,-14.0 to -4.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"The role of the risk management game showing how leveraging the strategy of development against risk helps us reduce adversary impact when odds occur and take advantage of the opportunity it present. The trade off is between whether the severity of the lost is acceptable or not , and whether protection or insurance is the best options depends on the likelihood of the disasters. in this game, knowledge helps to predict the likelihood of risk, which helps us make the appropriate inform decision. Preparation for risk also consider timing as well. Where the likelihood and severity of the disaster are small , it's would be waste to use available cash to carry out insurance or build protection early where it could depreciate over time. I have played the game more than one times. After each time, I learnt the key of successful development lie in timing of the decision . It also helps me have the better understand of the scale of severity and likelihood of the game , there for make more informed decision accordingly. The game itself is very well thought out and definitely helps me appreciate the theories I learnt in risk lecture more. If I would change anything to the game, I would make research and development to be incremental rather that restart from zero each time. As in real life, once technology innovation occur, it doesn't go backwards. In development, once the techniques, and know how is known, it couldn't only get better, and in very exceptional rare circumstances where the innovation is completely destroyed and need to restart from scratch.

I think that the risk horizon game gives us a good idea of how we can balance all the activities or stages involved in risk management.Â  First of all, it makes clear that everything grows around development or a wealth development activity.Â  That's what we should focus on.Â  Risk management only provides a framework to to make wealth creation possible and, to some extent, inmune to shocks or unexpected events.Â  So everything imoves around the creation of wealth.Â  Now the first thing we should do in the game is to seek knowledge about the dangers to our wealth creation activity.Â  In this case meteors.Â  Then we have to asses the probability of a shock happening at any given moment based in the knowledge we have previously gathered.Â  This will drive our spending in rsik management.Â  For the most part is better to prepare for a shock by buying insurance that will cover a relatively low part of the whole value.Â  That will leave enough resources to pay for protection of the villageÂ  moving the level of the village a little higher.Â  If the protection against shocks is good enough we will only have to spend a small amount in insurance, that is take an accessible plan that will only cover about a third of the total valuation of the village. Â  The key is to create a good dynamic in which we asses the probability of a shock by keeping a close eye in the environment.Â  Then we act on the information we gathered.Â  Now we have information that will tells us how much we should spend on risk management.Â  For small shocks we only need to spend a little.Â  For big shocks we have to spend a lot more.Â  We don't know when we are going to have small or big shocks but we do know that small shocks happen a lot more frequently than big shocks.Â  If we start spending small amounts on protection very frequently, in time we can build a very robust infrastructure to protect ourselves from shocks while leaving enough money ti spend on wealth building projects or activities.Â  2. The first time I played the game I was a little clumsy.Â  I didn't know exactly how it worked but it served as a learning experience.Â  The second time I completely focused on developing the village as a priority and in preserving it by checking up the sky for threats, buying low insurance and spending a considerable amount moving the ground level until it was safe for shocks in the near future.3. I think the game is fine, unless you want to add a set of different risks instead of just one.Â  For example, financial risk on wealth creating activities.

What was the role of riskmanagement in the game?Risk management was vital to the success of the game. Only through thedeployment of adequate protections, research and insurance was it possible toactually progress. The reason for this is without protection and insurance, itsimply wasn't possible to recover from shocks. However, by employing protectionand insurance, it was both much easier to recover from shocks (and in somecases, there was no shock) whilst also investing in improving the infrastructureof the village for increased prosperity. 2. What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms ofknowledge, protection, and insurance?At first, it was a vital trade off to build small enough so that there wasenough income, but also so that there was enough money left over to purchaseprotection and the highest level of insurance. The trade-off here is that thegrowth of the village was much slower because investment wasn't as forthcoming.However, it meant, with proper protection and insurance in place, that longterm growth was both possible and sustainable. 3. In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, orafter some time)?The immediate benefit of insurance was that inevitable repair costs were muchlower which meant recovery was much quicker. The long term investment inprotection paid off, because as the comets got more severe, their impactactually diminished because the higher level of protection afforded tremendous resilienceto the village. 4. What did you do differently the second time you played the game?When I first played, I tried to grow infrastructure too quick without adequateprotection. This led to disaster. The second time round meant much greaterinvestment in protections, research and insurance. Although this meant therewas a much slower growth in terms of upgrading the village and its buildings,it was sustainable and this allowed me to progress to level 5 in the game. 5. What were the main things you learned from the game?Slow growth is still growth and adequate protection to mitigate or eliminatethe shocks from risk are essential for development and progression.6. What change would you propose to better represent the risk managementchoices that matter in the place you live?Flooding is a problem near where I live. If I were to add to the game, I'd wantto introduce more diverse protection options and upgrades. Raising the villageis a great concept, but does not translate well to the real world as it isn'tgoing to be very easy to physically raise a village. But perhaps provide otherpurchasable options. Some examples:""Walls"" may be     cheaper, but offer less protection. ""Early warning     systems"" could be a low-cost investment which increases the rate of     research in the village. ""Upgrade defence""     of individual buildings to withstand the impact of the shocks and thus     facilitate easier repair. It could be an expensive upgrade, but worth the     investment due to much-reduced repair costs. These added protection options would allow the player to introduce morecost-benefit analysis of various solutions, make different trade-offs and addgreater depth to the game's risk management lessons."220.245.214.186,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Preparing for the risks, confronting them and coping withtheir effects are all essential components ofÂ Risk Management.Â  Effective riskmanagement can save property and lives,Â Â give people food and financial security, minimize or preventÂ  crises of various forms andÂ  ensure development.Â  The essential elements of risk management preparation areacquiring Â knowledge, obtaining protectionand insurance.

Â This is mainly due to lack of knowledge on therelationships among them to find the best combination.After the first attempt, I tried to balance my protection,insurance and research in a way that could mitigate the impacts of the damages.Main thing that Â I learnt from the gameis that gathering knowledge is the most important aspect in the risk management.Â Â  The success ofÂ  engaging adequate protection, insurance andcommunity and institutional support depends mainly on the knowledge levels gainedon the probability of the incidence of risks and the severity of their impacts.For a new version of the game, I wish to add aÂ  warning system to give the community a betterknowledge on the severity of what they can expect, so that they can make moreinformed choices and trade -offs in terms of Â different elements protection, insuranceresearch etc. Â "62.194.202.236,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"1The role of Risk Management: In this case, we can speake of a Systemic Risk. Research (knowledge), Government money and community involvement are Â highly important in management of this type of risk, to reduce uncertainty and build resilience in the best possible option.The game was about building pods Â and community, research on obstacles/comets/shocks and protection by technology and insurance; sharing damage and getting insights, earning money by growing the community/wealth to be able to pay and share damage and take risks with others and overcome obstacles and build resilience.Â The effect of Risk Management:Combining capacity to perpare for obstacles in advance, with an ability to cope afterwards.The protection in the game seems to start by enhancing the community. That is one way, you can help each other, build knowledge, strength, earn money. And this is clearly pointing out, what we have learned from this course: People willing to take risks, you have to take risks in order to find opportunities. In this game, it seems to me that making a community, Then getting money from research, then protecting by lifting, and then insurance where the best ways to chose for.It seemed that only the highest level affected the cometrisk, having enough protection.The principles for Risk Management:Be realistic and build foundations.In this game, I saw that there was a focus on lifting the Island, based on research.And I saw that damage up to a certain level was accepted, and rebuilding of pods was postponed in order to do research and build protection.The balance between the choises was hard to reach as in many Risk Management Cases.The comets keep getting faster and faster and building and upgrading pods costs a lot of money, but they seem to be the only way out! Research helps to get money, which I said earlier I can only accept from Government money, cause otherwise, it would take money and time also. Building protection seemd to cost little then building pods, which seems strange to me.Â 2What I would do differently:I have tried the game over and over again and what I learned was this:I found it difficult to balance between the choises. Lack of resource where Money and time. Â I run out of money all the time and there was little time to spend. So in short the best option seems to me:Build pods, do research, get protection. I wouldn't go to fast on insurance, that's what I did all the time, or spend too much on it. This is probably due to my Western thinking. I learned that a bit damage to pods could be accepted, that community is very important and that research is also important. Then build and then as fast as you can, get protection (lift the island). I learned, once you get growing, you can keep doing better, when risk and oppurtunity is well managed and balanced.3Developments to the game:I would like to see that research also costs money:Â Strangely enough in this game, you get money quickly when doing research. Research costs a lot of money; it pays back on longterm Yes and in short time when taken simple protection. so I think, it was government money, which is applaudible, being it a Systemic Risk.I would like to add:- metres to better see influence/costs of research, protection and development- a free option, for example: spend money on a shelter for everyone, gifts from abroad/ngo/ climate/waterissues, or other issues what may occur to the community,Â markets, education, communication, loans and savings etc)."176.205.158.173,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"TheÂ roleÂ of theÂ Risk Management in the game provide a methodology to identify and analyze the impact of loss to the world of fictional world Alora. It was a competition of time vs funds or resources. In the game i had to choose the best possible insurance along with developing and upgrading pods. The game was about to realize the importance of knowledge i.e each comet has different characteristics depending upon the damage it will do and it is notÂ necessary that the comet will surely hit but still we need to get prepare as we never know whether it will impact us and how much it will impact. Protection was done according to different levels. Initially the protection was not hard due to few pods were supposed to be manage. but later in the game as we developed and upgraded more pods, protection of the pods were becoming difficult which suggest that in general that if a country is having more population the risk of damage also increase with it. In case of insurance there was 3 different terms of insurance in each level. In the start i was dependent on insurance more but as i proceed to through next level. rely on insurance decreases because i was more developed in later levels as compare to level 1Â so i didn't need to bought expensive insurance terms because i was able to manage repair through my own funds.First when i played the game my whole focus was on development and upgrading pods not to manage the risk of comets. which caused me to loose the level 2 and hardly i was able to reach at level 3. Then i gave so much importance to risk management that i didn't gave any attention to development all my focus was stick to managing risk associate with comets which caused me failing at level 3 because of less development of pods as all cost were put through managing risk and buying insurance with 75% terms. Then in third try i took a balance of risk management and development. and in later stages i decreased the cost of insurance and focused on development equally which enable me to reach level 5. I learned the importance of the risk management, and i understood that by preparing for risk can reduce the damage and also you can mitigate the risk by taking insurance. Research helps in getting knowledge of the risk hence it can be reduced andÂ eliminated.If i would be giving option to change one thing in game i would like to change the risk from comets toÂ earthquake or floods or both. As these are the risk faced by most of the countries. The duration of the game should be increase with more option to be provided for managing risk. For example in the current game the only risk was comet and only way to manage it was through research and provide community connection and insurance to reduce the cost related to risk. I think multiple risk like earthquake and floods and dealing with risk by choosing the best option will give the idea and also test the risk managing skills.Â "108.20.41.30,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,-63.0 to -36.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"The game required you to balance development, protection, insurance and knowledge. I played the game many times. It I successfully completed level five once, but the game crashed before I could complete level six, and I did not record my code at level five, so my official score was failing level five, which I did many times. I quickly learned that I needed to develop as quickly as posable, because the faster you develop the more resources you get. Insurance is not necessary in the early rounds, but is important in the later rounds since the damage seems to grow much faster than the revenues. Protection is very important, and it is best to invest in it early when you have more tolerance in the system. Later in the game resources are more stressed, so you are much better off if you already have a good base level of protection. I'm not sure that research was useful. It made me feel good to know how bad a threat could be, but I'm not sure that the knowledge improved my play.I think the game could be changed to allow you to make an investment in community infrastructure that would buy you more time to click on the links after the disaster.Â "101.187.108.240,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"1The role of risk management in the Risk Horizon game was tomanage the risks faced by the community as it developed so that its developmentwas sustainable.Â  The source of all risksfaced by the community was a series of comets of varying damage risk and impactprobability that could crash into the adjacent sea causing wave and flooddamage to the exposed community. Â Â The componentsof risk management available were:Knowledge â€“ by researching the incoming comets,the likelihood of impact and level of damage could be assessed.Protection - comprising elevating the overalllevel of the community settlement to protect it from inundation when cometscrash into the ocean.Â  The recommendedlevel of elevation was equal to the damage risk of the incoming comet.Insurance â€“ Insurance was available for purchaseat varying levels to mitigate the cost of repairs to community damage.Coping â€“ The community when damaged was modelledto cope by the player connecting the pod structures when they lit up on thescreen.Â  This represented the communityworking together and developing as a community.In order to do reasonably well,it was necessary to remain on high alert for risks and opportunities formanaging them.Â  Insurance was found to beof limited effectiveness as it was expensive and when damage occurred, allcommunity pods were affected, so repairs plus insurance were very expensive.Â  As pods were upgraded, insurance became abetter proposition.Â  Time spent inresearching comets was valuable as was finding out the relation between damagerisk and recommended protection.Â  Findingout how to connect the community was very helpful, I happened on this late when,after many unsuccessful attempts, I went back and took the tutorial.Preparation for risk took sometime to get right and it was necessary to be ever vigilant and on the ball for researchingthe comets, resetting the protection, and making connections and repairs after ahit. 2I played the game many timesuntil achieving a win at level 4. If I were to play it again I would make sureto complete the tutorial as well as read the instructions before starting.Â  Not doing the tutorial before starting meantI did not have the necessary knowledge from the instructions to know how toplay the game optimally and also left me with the bad habit of not always jumpingin soon enough to make connections after a hit.Â The main thing I learned from the game was to understand how the game worksbefore starting it.Â  I am not sure thisis possible in real life where you get thrown in at the deep end and expectedto sink or swim.Â  Survival is a learningexperience.3If I was asked to develop a newversion of the game, I would recommend the following changes:The game should not be so time limited, but theplayer should receive points for faster growth rates however there should also bea risk associated with a too high growth rate.When a failure at a levelÂ is recorded, thegame should not return to zero but should continue on from that point as in thecase of a win at a level."92.234.24.103,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk Horizon for me was one of those essentially simple but annoyingly addicted games I ended up playing for quite some time. As you play the game more, you realise that it is all about balance. Because of the different limitations (can't do anything while researching; no development while building protection; less capital if buying insurance) it is immediately obvious that one must trade-off each of these against each other.Â After my first attempts at trying to fill up the spaces with houses, I realised that I didn't need as many if I focused on developing the ones I had, which left more capital for protection etc.Â The key to the game it appears is striking this balance and using knowledge to boost limited protection. Although it may seem wise to get full insurance every level, if one invests more in developing early so better protection can be built, then more time can be spent on researching dangerous comets and thus more reaction time to build connections. This kind of tactic, if well executed, allows one to deal with the majority of comets to strike in the first few levels, and if enough protection is built up early on, almost all comets with minimal damage.Â Of course, the risk taken here is that without insurance you are open to game-ending damage, but what you notice towards the end of the game is that the insurance is usually not enough to prevent this from happening, as it takes too long to rebuild before the timer runs down. So, the best thing to do is pump money into early development and protection, take the risk on lower insurance rates and spend the rest of the time researching for that extra boost.Â In real terms, this would lead to the conclusion that overall, risk prevention and limitation are the most important components of risk management; one would prefer to minimise as much of the risk as is possible in a preventative capacity, rather than pick up the pieces after insufficient protections have been breached.Â Risk management where I live (London) initially may appear to be too unique to the individual concerned but in actuality there is basically just one risk; loss of income. The cost of living is so high, that for your average household, the loss of the main wage earner could begin a slide into poverty, very quickly indeed.Â Institutionalised risk management and education have reduced normal environmental risks to a distinctly rare and unlikely event for most people. This means that there is little personal investment in prevention. For example, the Thames Barrier prevents London being flooded on average 7 times a year, sometime three times that. This means that very few, if any, have ever thought it possible that London floods. If the Barrier fails, there are little to no contingency measures in place.Â Probably the best way to represent the risk management choices in London is allowing overdrafts with extortionate interest rates and allowing the insurance company to not pay out after a flood.Â "107.5.46.136,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"GameReflection EssayÂ Risk Horizon allowed me to utilize risk management in thefollowing ways:Â  I began building in level 1, bought50% loss insurance and then lifted the island up by at least three bars. Iscanned the sky for comets, while building better structures. I adjusted theisland lift as necessary to ensure resource growth. In level 2 and 3, my first prioritywas 75% loss insurance. This resulted in lower damage costs. I then proceededto build better structures, keeping an eye out for comets. I researched cometsmore and raised the island higher in these levels than in level 1.Â Â  My trade-offs were in allocatingresources towards protection and insurance early in the level, and havingresource production and knowledge compensate for it by the end of the level. Toensure smooth transition from one level to the next, all buildings had to becompleted (or repaired) prior to ending a level. That allowed optimal moneygeneration rate.Â  The first time I played the game, Ihad no clue on how to use research, and did not generate enough resources toprogress past level 1. I played the game numerous times and my above-statedstrategy reflected my optimal choices. Â I learned to allow for build and repair time, as that was aninconvenient variable in the game. Higher game levels produced more risk ofloss, so crutches like insurance, comet research (community building) andraising the island were balanced with resource production to progress throughthe game. If I were tasked with developing anew version of the game, I would reduce the build time (or make it the sametime for all structures), as it resulted in more losses than comet hits. Thebuild time is a voluntary but necessary risk to progress through the game, andseemed to be more important than the involuntary risks from comet hits. If Iwere to tailor the game to my current environment, I would let the lower levelslast 4 minutes, and make the higher levels last for progressively shorterperiods. If the strategy were not optimized by then, the player would lose.

Usually it requires to increase the protection level to compete with the severity level of the stars. On the other hand, we need to keep an eye on the development of pods in order to get more money to increase the development level and complete the level goal. I usually make sure the protection level is beyond the severity of the stars, so that nothing will be damaged. It turns out that if the pods get damaged, it will cost a lot of money to repair, and the development level will drop dramatically, sometimes leads to a failure in the level. So I believe it is always a good choice to fulfill the protection level first. I usually don't buy the insurance, as my protection level is high enough to prevent any damage. However, I do experience some time that the severity is so high (such as full severity but I usually just keep the protection level for about 70%-80%) that I get a little bit damage, which always result in failing that level. I usually do not spend much money on research in the severity level of the stars, but just check it very quickly and make sure that my protection level is 20% higher than that.I have played several times on this game. At first I didn't get the rules quite well, and I always buy the highest level of insurance and see the pods crush and repair them. I did not raise the protection level at first. I can sometimes get to level 3, but I often end the game very quickly. Then I studied the rule a bit more, and decide to put more effort on the protection level and development of pods. Then I get to pass the level requirement very quickly, and get quite good at it.

It was important to take risks and investon property, while accurately navigating hazards and investing only on the necessary precautions.2.I played the game nearly a dozen times, and learned to not spend more than I needed to on protection and how to takemore calculated risks. In the beginning, I invested heavily in the highestdegree of insurance and protection.The costs ofrepairs are lower when there are more clients pool the risk. It was cheaper to repair the less expensive properties. In the course of the game, it becomesclear that the point is to match the possible damage that could be inflicted bya comet to the level of protection and insurance, at the right time.(In the course of playing, mostly I improved because I understoodthe controls of the game better, so I understood that I had to hold theprotection button long enough to match the risk level associated with comets. )For the sake of class discussion, many of the points raised inchapter 2 of the report are illustrated. Risk management involves planning and resiliance,and we do this with knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping.Â  3.Variablesand probability are big obstacles, so I would introduce more variables.

Then I tried built few pods first, develop them enhanced them and if there were no much shocks around for some time I tried to built a few more. Meanwhile I invested some money for protection which of course slowed down development overall, however the damage after every shock was smaller.I had no infulence to comets itself I could only observe them and based on information and especially on 'chance of hit information I could adjust my development depend on risk whether is high or low but even this wasn't a good source to trust.

On the other hand I couldn't completely restrain the development the village had to thrive.In my place where I live the risk of natural distater is rather low, there are some other risks like financial crisis which affected us all in some extent. Nevertheless the biggest issue and obstacle to development is rooted somewhere deep the fear of failure and complexes. We are also not taught to insure ourselves or families or housholds.

The goal of the course is toÂ realize for the community the opportunities available through the given resources (land, financial resources, etc...) in a context of environmental risks (meteors falling n the sea and creating natural disaster). To strive and succeed, it is necessary to balance well the different components of risk.First, the end goal is to build assets for the community, so a significant part of the available resources should go to do it. The goal is not toÂ devote most resources to achieve 100% protection against risk, or to avoid risk altogether - but on the contrary to build a reasonable exposure to risksSecond, it is possible to gain information and knowledge regarding upcoming risksÂ by buying surveys. that helps with assessing the level of protection and assurance required to reasonably mitigate the risksThird, once risks are evaluated, it is possible to mitigate risks byÂ buying protection (by raising the level of the ground) and by buying insurance (reducing the financial loss in caseÂ the riskÂ is realized)Â Â Finally, if the risk is materialized, then it is possible to cope with it by buying repairsI played the game a couple of times. When I started first, I wasÂ using too many resources to buy the assets, and got stuck when I was caught with too little protectionÂ when a big meteor crushed. Second time, I was probably too prudent, and could not finish on time.Â Third time I got it right, by raising the level of protection only whenÂ my observations where showing a significant risk ahead, and by building the assets at the right rhythm - not too fast, not too slowly. I also has to accept some exposure to risk and accept that some of my assets be damaged. Maybe I was also lucky, I don't know...This game is indeed a simplified model to describe the reality of risk management. It might overlook the fact that in real life, people get more and more resilient and knowledgeable to risks as they are exposed to them. For example, some assets can be built more efficiently or some information management can be more efficient as peopleÂ encounter those risksÂ over and over again. So, one way to make the game more realistic would be to improve the efficiency of risk management choices, or maybe to make available new risk management tools as the player is becoming more experienced. that would allow the community to become more and more sophisticated,Â while coping more and more efficiently with risks.Â "14.139.224.146,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Whatwas the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and whattrade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or aftersome time)?Ans : Riskmanagement had a very important role, in the game as there was a tradeoff to bemade in terms of resources available and the avenues where they can be used. Thethree main avenues were: protection, insurance, research. All three had theirown benefits. I always tried to keep the Pods at a comparatively higherelevation giving them the protection. While research was my main tool, throughwhich I could minimize the losses by community living to boost my protection. Insurancewas taken by me according to the levels of difficulty, as the level gottougherÂ  I increased the insurance plan,this helped to mitigate the losses in case of severe meteors. This preparation helpedme to reduce the losses levels of impact to 0%, and sometimes 7-9 %. This was aremarkable achievement as now I could easily upgrade the Pods and thus inducedevelopment in the community.2.Ifyou played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were toplay it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what didyou do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learnedfrom the game?Ans: Iplayed the game more than once, and there was some improvement in every nextattempt. These were as follows:Â·Â From thenext time, I started utilizing the community living structure well byresearching the meteors.Â·Â By keeping atrack of all my investments, I could better decide which insurance policy toopt for according to the last experience of the number and quality of meteors.Â·Â The properutilization of resources that is if we have enough monetary resources than timeshould be well utilized as when we research for the meteors. Learnings:Â·Â When researchis being carried out, if we have enough resources then go for upgrading ordeveloping a new Pod, and then continue researching.Â·Â Spend timeon researching only when we see that there is a big chance of hitting.Â·Â If there aremore than one meteors, decide according to the potential threat and speed oftheir movement and accordingly research all of the required ones.Â·Â If we managethe risks well, there can be development in the longer run which can be thenutilized for prosperity in living.3.The game captures, in a simplifiedway, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing anew version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing.What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choicesthat matter in the place you liveÂ Â  Ans: thechanges that I would like to make are as follows:Â·Â  Separate insurancefor the different geographical areas involved, this would include a decisionparameter that which area to develop first and which area to insure, doing a bettercost-benefit analysis.Â·Â  The returnon cost should be given, that in which version of POD how much are we gettingin return, this would include a trade-off between upgrading the PODS and therisk mitigation..

If you spend too much onbuilding and upgrading pods, you will be exposed to comets when they hit. Whenyou sustain damage from comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. Onthe other hand, if you spend too much on preparation for risk, you will nothave enough money to develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.This is a balance policy makers have toconsider all the time.They have limited resources, so there is a tension between spending up front onrisk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but may not hit) or tospend on other development priorities. How should they spend their money?Â The role of riskmanagement had to do with the development of the village and its protection,with limited resources (funding). The preparation for risk management hascertain financial cost, but slowly it helped attain the same or even betterfinancial condition. If I were playing the game again, I would possibly attemptdifferent timing and strategy on my decisions for research (knowledge),development and insurance, so that I increase the likelihood of advancing tothe next level.If I could change one thing, it might be the possibility ofdeveloping mechanisms to defend the possibility of damage from the comets in along term. In that way, there might be less need to short-term insurance."71.129.50.170,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The game is veryinteresting andÂ successful in consolidating the concept of riskmanagement. All events are presented in a simple way, but captured almost mostof the major factors of risk. If I have a choice to improve the game by addinga simple thing, I would add more options for the type of natural disasters sothat players can choose appropriate disaster for the place they live.Â  For example, flooding or typhoon would be bestsuitable for the South East Asia areas while tornadoes would be a good choicefor the United States. Â From eachparticular type of selected disaster, the player will have a choice to see howthe consequences would be; the protection planning and insurance thereforevaried. In fact, the disaster type dictates how the frame work of riskmanagement should be although the end result are the same asÂ destructionÂ are unimaginablefinancially and economically in worst case scenarios. TheÂ current disaster type in the game doesn'tÂ represent an actual situation that most commonly occurred on earth; however,it has captured the overall process of understanding the riskÂ environment toplan for protections.Â Â In fact, there alwaysare more than one type of natural disasters that qualify for the riskmanagement in every communities. Â In myarea, earth quake and firing are the disasters that we are looking at for therisk management.Â  Through learning howthe shock happened in the past and what would happen in the future, we aremobilizing the whole community in planning for coping with the problem. Thegame feature will then have this capacity, and perhaps becomes more interestingwhen the player has to deal with multiple threats that, in worst case scenario,would happen at the same time. The player totally has his or her choice toestablish the situation complexity. The rewarding of course will be based onhow many and what type of disasters that the player are facing. Â I hope my idea issimple enough for the change in the game.Â I do enjoy playing it, and this is the best practice in reinforcing thelesson we are learning.Â  It is the firsttime I see how a computer game benefits an academic lesson.Â  I hope, in the future, we will see inacademic environment, more fun activities are available for learning andstudying.Â  Be creative and we will makeour way!Â "74.88.252.191,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,-63.0 to -36.0,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"To be honest with you I was skeptical about the game when Ifirst saw it. However after I played it, I changed my mind. The game, in spiteof being so simple, provided me with a lot of insights about risk management. It showsÂ the importance of all parts of risk management:Â knowledge, protection and insurance. Here are some of insights that I found very interesting.First of all,Â when I was playing the game, Iwas researching comets. It helped me to predict the severity and the chance ofhit, so I was able to build up necessary protection and decide on timing of myexpenditures. This demonstrates the importance of getting knowledge in order tocope with risk more affectively. Since the time and money were limited, duringthe game as in reality one have to make decisions on how to use availableresources in the most effective way. Thus, I had to decide whether I want to buildor upgrade a pod in order to develop my settlement or to increase protection orto buy insurance. These kinds of choices are very similar to what manyindividuals, societies and governments are facing every day.Â Second, the game demonstrates the importance of building upprotection. Even though you could not see the benefits of money that you havespend if there is no damage after the disaster (comet stroke). However, if thelevel of protection is low and not sufficient, the losses are much greater andit becomes difficult to achieve the required level of development in time. Inaddition, the connections between different pods helped to increase protection,thus the higher integration of society is beneficial.Third, I would like to talk about the insurance. When I wasplaying the game for the first time I was purchasing insurance every round.Finally my reserves were depleted and I was not able to reach the requiredlevel of development in tame because of the lack of money. The second time whenI played the game, I didnâ€™t purchase insurance during the early stages of thegame. Instead I invested money in building up the protection. However, later inthe game the insurance is absolutely necessary, because once you got hit, therenovation is very costly and there is almost no chance to â€œcome backâ€ù on trackin time.If I can add one thing to the game it would be different typesof buildings/different industries with different exposure to the risk, but alsodifferent returns. So the choices of prioritization should be made.Thank You!"86.21.27.195,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The game provided a simplified but nevertheless realistic version of real obstacles that might impede the development progress, giving an authentic overview of events that disrupt original plans and projects.I unfortunately did not reach higher than level four, and, without completing it, as I endeavoured to find a balance between knowledge, protection and development. I did, however, find that knowledge and research were the most beneficial aspects to place extra focus on. I spent an hour at two separate occasions, playing the game, struggling originally with the instructions, but soon harmonised the relationship between developing and researching, in favour to focusing excessively on protection and insurance. This way I learnt the importance of continuing â€œnormal lifeâ€ù despite external threats as they cannot be managed or contained but simply prepared for. I also found that the further up in the levels one went, the more the comets missed due to the preparation having been conducted in the earlier ones.I understand that protection was an impediment in itself, as it withdrew valuable time that could have been spent doing research and developing, however, I think that it is something that should be incorporated into the development plan of action, rather than considered a separate element in the field of risk management. Insurance, as a strategy, usually did not come in very handy in the game if enough rigorous protection was in place. It was commonly an expense that did not provide a profitable enough return and thus came out less useful. Insurance only marginally decreased the cost of rebuilding and re-capacitating the community. Furthermore as a long term benefit insurance was barely relevant in the situation, as the cost tended to outweigh the benefits. Â I would, as an improvement to the game in general, but mainly for the morale of the player, suggest checkpoints which allows the player to restart on the same level on which they failed. After having failed four levels on numerous occasions, I found it rather demoralising having to recommence at the first level each time. Furthermore, based on my location, which is currently a commute between Scandinavia and the British Isles, I for example think that community connections become less relevant, as Northern Europe in general has quite individualistic cultural norms. Instead, I might even be so bold to suggest an eradication of that component of the game in order to regionalise it, thus making it even difficult for the community to cope with the shocks.I learned primarily that balance is key, both in development in general and in risk preparation strategy. One of the most interesting aspects of the game, and how to rebuild a community, was how linking the citizenry with each other has such a powerful effect, which one might struggle to visualise if not having experienced any shocks that have affected oneâ€™s community in a similar way. Â As a recent graduate from international development studies, I have not until commencing this course fully realised the significance of risk management within this field, and, it was given a substantially small amount of attention during my course. There is a need for fostering solid infrastructure between these elements within the realm of development as well as e.g. security and conflict resolution, to reduce both societal and personal adverse shocks in all three areas. Further education on these issues are essential, for preparing and providing individuals and households with the adequate tools in order to cope with adverse shocks. I will suggest for my university to implement this game into the course plans of one or several of the modules.Â "58.172.70.3,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"1. Risk management in the game demonstrated that in life their are trade offs to decision making. Resources are finite and therefore you need to way the pros and cons for selecting certain strategies over others. In order of importance the game seemed to reinforce that knowledge is the most important, then protection and finally insurance. However importantly all are required to cover various levels of shock. For example, knowledge is demonstrated by identifying which comets are likely to hit. You can safely ignore those that are not going to and you need to focus on those that are. Knowledge allows you to understand the level of protection required to adequately meet the shock. In this game this was the level of the village raised as protection. It is a waste of resources and time to raise protection so high that the community cannot develop. Protection of a few does not help you progress. Finally insurance provided you a means of quickly recovering from a shock. The game highlighted that insurance is not necessarily immediately however it is required once you have reached a certain level of development.Â 2. After playing the game numerous times it became apparent that building more pods and increasing their level increased the overall score. A parallel to life can be drawn with the importance of investing in developing infrastructure, buildings etc. Insurance became important when you had more to lose. With only a few buildings the cost benefit ratio was not there for insurance. Importantly the more i played the game the more I understood that initial research of which comets (shocks) would likely eventuate. Those that would not could be ignored whereas those that were going to hit had to be addressed. This could be through protection - raising the level of the village, insurance if protection would not cover the shock or continued research.Â 3.Â I was not really sure what the connections represented. However the more research that was conducted the more time i had to make connections. I assume that this parallels to the community helping each other in time of shock. As highlighted in the weekly resources and also the Risk Report investing in the right technologies for a given area is vital. This is dykes in Neatherlands, drainage (required) in Mumbai and building codes in Chile. It may be a good addition to add this component to the game. That is certain structures are better built in a certain area. This would required knowledge. If they are built in the correct area the protection level is higher. Therefore you need less insurance. Vice versa if you build them in incorrect areas their protection level is lower and insurance is higher."187.240.115.241,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"If it startwith the definition of risk management; as the process of confronting risk,preparing for them, and coping with their effects; the role of the riskmanagement in the game show the importance to confronting risk, when you do notknow that these comes; so do the relevance of research and at the same timethat this allows to preparing as better as possible to confronting the risk.The game shows that coping with the effects of the risk are better when you decideinvest in insurance and make alliances with the town.The firsttime that I play the game it was hard because I could not understand theimportance of the research and the alliances with the community; so the nexttime that I play the game I did pay attention to the option of the insurance,then to the importance of the communication with the village, and finally Iunderstood that the research is important but is more important take thisinformation and make the decision in the right moment, because if you decidedthat protection is needed in the village when is late, the money that youinvest in it is money waste. So that, the resources invest in research will beuseful is take the information and take measures of control in order topreparing for the risk before of it occurs.Now summarizemy experience with the game is that the preparing for the risk affect in apositive way because I could survive the second time that I played, because, Iinsist, I did the research, I bought an insurance versus damage, I established communicationswith the village and also I bought protection, so the result was that Isurvived more levels. And this is a really good analogy with the life, if youinvest in protection for the event even if you are not sure that occurs, youmight be quiet when contingency happens.For thelast, for my community it would be interesting introduce changes in order tomanagement the risk with the flood and landslides from hills, principally,because we have others problems like the traffic every day because the streetsare not well planned and the different manifestations of various groups.But, backto the flood, I think that is really necessary that the people aware about theimportance because of the benefits of insurance versus risk of this kind.

Any of the three â€˜toolsâ€™â€”knowledge/research,protection, and insuranceâ€”costs money in its application and goes at theexpense of another one. The attempt to protect yourself against the drawbacksof a hit by matching the severity (protection) makes you lose valuable time fordeveloping the settlement. I began noticing the ramifications of not focusingon developing the settlement to a sufficient degree only at a later stage(levels 3 and 4) because the more sophisticated research stations take longertime to build. In addition, the development of the settlement is very importantfor properly predicting the severity and probability of the hit. I had toexperience a few times that I thought I was prepared but then got caught bysurprise because the prediction was unreliable. Clearly, this shows that all ofthose three tools and strategies are intertwined and need to be pursued in aholistic approach.Â Iplayed the game more than once since I admittedly did not manage to get tolevel 4 in my first attempts. I somewhat relied less on insuring the settlementin my latterâ€”successfulâ€”attempts because I felt it was possible to develop thesettlement more quickly by protecting it rather than rebuilding it at a cheaperrate. But obviously this was only my personal approach. However, at times it isinevitable to use the insurance, in particular when the level of protectioncouldnâ€™t match the severity of the hit. In these cases I tried to buy theinsurance shorty before the hit. I realised that it is extremely important toremain flexible with regard to the application of the tools and seize theopportunities in the respective situations. Furthermore, it became quiteobvious that one cannot neglect any of the three tools highlighting theimportance of an integrated approach to risk management. Â Ithink an interesting change or addition to the game would be to incorporateother stakeholders, such as other households or banks that can form a communityand share the burden of managing risk. Since in real life your choices oftendepend on the choices of otherâ€”or are taken jointlyâ€”this might bring the gameyet another step closer to the reality of managing risk. Hence I believe thatthis change would better represent the risk management choices that matter inthe place where I (and arguably all of us) live: a global community.Â "58.8.84.77,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,n/a,n/a,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"The purposes is pods built and upgrade pod to higher levelfrom 1 to 6 on time against comets.

I bought the insurance from the third level, the best insurance that saved me of big damages of the high severity comets. The risk was crucial for development, It allows me to have development and at the same time be protected of the comets.2. I played it more that once, I think that along the games what I were learning was to balance how much to spend in development and how much in risk. A really important balance to reach the requirements of each level.

Thegame highlights that building foundations is important, as it is not just aboutavoiding commits.Â  The role of the riskmanagement game was to gain a better understanding of the importance ofbalancing and investing in research (knowledge), protection, insurance, andcoping as a community.The game had you making choices between how you develop yourcommunity and how you manage risks. There was a choice of increasingresearching which contributes to knowledge, a choice to protect by increasingelevation, and a choice to purchase insurance.

When you were able to prepare for the risk, such as through usingresearching, you were able to connect with your developments and minimize thedamage, if it occurred as we learned that sometimes the comet passes by. You cannotavoid risks and impacts but you can reduce the damage they would have on yourcommunity. The development meter also reminds us that having responsibility isnot limited to just avoiding or preparing for risky situations but it is alsoimportant to develop your communities and build foundations.

The game showed that the difficulty in making decisions that balance between these factors and also the severity and likelihood of the risk eventuating. The first time I over-purchased insurance and protection, so in future attempts I took on more risk in order to grow more pods. If I could make the game more life-like, you could differentiate between systemic risks and individual risks to each pod, as though each pod represented an individual. Or you could make it a town, where there were several types of risks - disease, fire, unemployment, crime, drought etc and complicate the insurance and protection measures to be taken for each risk.Â "24.183.91.189,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game associates with coordinating the resource distribution between development (building and upgrading pods) and risk prevention (leveling up the base/insurance). The knowledge is not necessarily represented well in this game, given that the knowledge is always 1 or 0. I have to choose between protection and insurance because clearly having both protection and insurance will impede development severely. More specifically, insurance has a large upfront cost and gets more and more expensive with either increased game level or more upgraded pods (I cannot say for sure which is the cause). The insurance cost won't be too much of a problem for lower levels because the development is relatively easy speed up. However, for higher levels, the large upfront cost for insurance takes too much resources and impedes development significantly, especially higher level pods take longer to develop and therefore the cost in time is more pronounced. Additionally, although insurance covers a percentage of damage, it still needs time for repair and in the meantime, the development is slowed down. Â Protection (leveling up the base) does not have upfront cost and can be adjusted to cope with the potential damage from the meteor. Although the aggregate cost for protection is higher that insurance, the protection can be used multiple times before it decreases significantly. Moreover, protection does not incur the damage repair process and won't affect the established development.My first strategy was to prioritize risk prevention. For any new appearing meteor, I would assess its potential damage and raise up the base to match the potential damage. In this way, I had enough time to cope with the meteor struck and basically had no damage from any struck. However, I had difficulty passing Level 3 using this strategy because I heavily invested in risk prevention so that the development speed does not meet the criteria. Then, I changed my strategy slightly and use insurance to cover the damage at lower levels, since the upfront cost at lower levels was acceptable, also the repair time for lower levels was short. At Level 2 and 3, I used my old strategy and deal with the risk with prevention.Â As I mentioned above, the knowledge function in this game was not clear. It seems like the knowledge of a meteor will change slightly during its trajectory. However, it would make more sense if over the whole period of time, the knowledge of the meteor increase and the potential damage and change of hit can be estimated more precisely. This would be closer to the reality that people learn to cope with a particular kind of risk more effecitively.

Managing therisk of comets through the use of research, insurance and protection allowedthe community to take informed action to protect infrastructure and hastenrecovery. However risk-management measures useresources, such as time and money that could otherwise be used for development.Â Therefore risk preparation can slowdevelopment initially. However it increases development in the long term bymaking communities more resilient and hastening recovery. Trade-offs have to bemade between risk management and development. By gaining research on the severityand probability of comet shocks a community can match the necessary level ofprotection and/or insurance to the probability of risk.On my first attempt at Risk Horizon, Ispent my resources on development and insurance. On my second attempt I betterprepared myself for risk by carrying out more research and investing inprotection rather than insurance. This allowed me to match protection with theseverity of the comet shocks. Protection slowed development initially but it hadincreased investment return in the long-term, as protection carried into thenext levels of the game.Risk Horizon illustrates the principles ofrisk management, reflecting the real world obstacles to risk management such asknowledge, financing andÂ behaviourÂ biases.Â It demonstrates the importance ofcollecting data about risk to make informed decisions and exemplifies thechallenges financing can play on risk management. Risk Horizon demonstratesthat even small investments in risk management will greatly increasedevelopment in the long term, and demonstrates the necessity of investing inrisk management even when finances are minimal.Â Risk Horizon also demonstrates behavioral biases, such as how easy itcan be to underestimate risks. This illustrates the importance of Governmentsproviding well-researched and planned risk management as well as providing incentivesand education to the public about the benefits of individual risk management.Â Risk Horizon illustrates elements of riskmanagement however in the real world communities often face risks from morethan one source.Â  To better reflect thechallenges of risk management a new version of Risk Horizon could include risksfrom multiple sources. For example including a health risk such as a pandemic.Measures would have to be taken to protect against comets whilst also investingin public health services to protect against pandemics. This would reflect thereal world challenges faced from spreading communities limited resources acrossmultiple sectors.Â "195.57.112.9,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The role risk management was to manage the development of a community and to prepare this community to confront risks.Â In the game we learnt in a practical way how important is:-manage resources: mainly in terms of economic resources and time investment. Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages.Â -manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks.Â -invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis.Â -the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles.Â The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risksThe game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones. Â  Â Â In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, "" Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity"". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community.Â "208.58.6.34,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"What was the role of risk management in the game? The role of risk management in the game was to teach how toÂ use assets such as knowledge, insurance and protection toÂ build a healthy development. What choices did you make? I used all the assets that were available. I did some research to learn about the strength of the comets when they strike; I protected the development against the comets, and most importantly I insured the development against the disaster the comets could cause. What trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection,  and insurance? In term of trade-offs, I noticed that IÂ  had to make a hard choice between upgrading the development and spending money on assets such as insurance, research and protection. I finally had to spent a lot of money not only to have a better insurance, but also to make sure that I had a better protection against the comets. I ended up not upgrading the development because I had invested almost all the money on insurance and protection of the development that I had acquired already. Â In what ways did preparation for risk affect development  (immediately, or after some time)? Preparation affected development in a way that I knew aheadÂ which comets could really destroy the development, and I also knew what could be the impact of each comet on the development. Knowing all that helped me select my insurance premium, and it also helped me focus more on investing on the development instead of spending the money on protection. If you played the game more than  once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the  main things you learned from the game? When I played the game for the first time, I did not do any research at all. I wasn't then able to be well-prepared to face the impact of the implosion of the comets. For that reason, I misused my funds on buying a highÂ insurance premium to protect the development against an imagery hit. When I noticed that I could study the comets and understand their strength and the probability of their destructive impact, I mainly focused on the research during the following games. The main thing I learned from the game is that one should always know his environment by doing some research, and once he knows his environment, he should make sure to take appropriate measure to protect his asset against eventual harm. The most important thing I learn is that insurance should always be part of our daily activity because it will help lower the cost of repair, and in some case the insurance may even pick up all the repair. Â What change would you  propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in  the place you live?Â Â  In this scenario, I will first of all show the consequences of unpreparedness, the consequences of the lack of insurance. Once I depict that, I will thenÂ educate people on the importance of insurance. Most importantly, I will ask people to invest a lotÂ in research so that they understand what actions they should take in orderÂ to reduceÂ the chances of lost in their activities.

While developing the community is the main goal, protecting the pods from the devastating effects of the meteors is essential. Both of these two tasks cost money, time, and attention for theplayer. The player should make calculated moves in terms of building new pod and/or developing the existing ones. Keeping the wealth for emergency spending,i.e. repairing comes at the price of missing your developmental goal. Also,even though spending time on watching the celestial bodies is essential for therecovery, it keeps you away from developing the village. This is also trueabout raising the land level. The cost for the research and raising the landlevel were negligible and both activities seemed to be very helpful. However,the main drawback is devoting your attention fully to these tasks, keeps youaway from taking the game to the next stage. The other risk that the playerneed to take is expansion timing. It is best to avoid spending the wealthbefore the strike of a meteor with high hitting probability. In one incident,despite the fact that the bar was above the level goal, a late hit, brought thedevelopment level below the level goal and caused failure, Thus, a deadly hittowards the end of stage can be too costly. I think, using the insurance isonly feasible towards the end of level when a comet with high chance of hit andpredicted severity. The other thing thatI noticed is that the game levels are not disconnected which makes sense. Theover-achievements from previous levels as well as the land level aretransferrable to the following levels. In fact, it seems that completing thehigher levels without surpassing the earlier levels milestones is unlikely.I will add a featurethat expedites the creation of wealth. Aside from and level protection andbuying insurance, I did not notice any option for increasing your assets. Iwill also make the development cost variable. For example, developing a podnext to a more developed pod more expensive and more rewarding.

The risks were the result of the comet hitting the land/water and causing waves which produced flooding. I worked through the tutorial a few times beforestarting the game, fearing that the game would be played out much faster than in the tutorial, but this was not the case. The key trade-offs were between money and security. When I initially played the game, I either did not focus on insurance or undervaluedthe cost of insurance relative the potential damage caused by the comets hitting the land. After a few iterations, it was clear that it was considerably more beneficial to buy a large amount of insurance and interesting, the game seemed to be played fasterat that point. Also using the lever to raise the island â€“ another means of disaster mitigation was very effective and even though there was a cost associated with this intervention, I seemed to recover wealth very quickly. The least effective decisionwas simply to build pods and to ignore the comets. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game? As stated above, after playing the game a couple of times, I realised just how important insurance was to protect the pods and recover from the damage caused by the comets. I initially underestimated the risk the comets posed and was surprised about how damage might vary â€“ in some cases it was over 70 per cent, then it fell to some 25 per cent and in some cases the damage was zero; again depending on the level of insurance purchased and the degree to which I have elevated the island. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live? If I were to play the game again, I might suggest introducing some other threats so the players need to choose between more types of intervention. In this instance, the trade off was calculated in terms of financial cost. There was no attempt to introduce other costs e.g. if one had to choose between paying for education, health care etc. or disaster insurance. I live in a developed country (UK) where there is considerable risk of flooding and in fact there was extensive flood damage earlier this year. The Thames Barrier is one example of a costly but effective intervention."65.216.245.2,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"It was difficult to win the game. I thought I had managed a good level of understanding of the various moving pieces in the game. I understand how research, insurance and preparedness affect the damage and the costs. I did create most of the pods away from the water body and believed in upgrading as soon as possible. Having insurance is surely a good plan especially when the game has comets flying in all the time. Upgraded pods/Insurance/research- all point to better preparedness. i spent a lot of time monitoring after purchasing all safeguards as soon as possible. After monitoring the comet, I used the slider to raise the level based on the severity of the hit. Having insurance helped in repair Â costs which was a god thing.

Without a good risk management strategy, all resources at human disposal will not result in effective risk management.Â Most places are often hit with flash flooding which can lead to sudden destruction allowing for little time to react and prepare.

There is several ways to prepare to futureproblems, in the game, asteroids, in real life, it can be different types ofcrisis, and the simplest example is an environmental crisis. If the inhabitantsof a specific area are vulnerable of suffering certain types of disasters, forexample floods due to tropical storms. There are several ways to prepare, liketaking insurance, gathering knowledge and raising your protection.The game teaches us how to combine the differenttypes of preparations in a very simple way. You can not only raise yourprotection because if the severity of the asteroid that hits is high, theeffect will be harsh. Is the same in real life, if in my country (El Salvador),people always build a barrier to avoid floods in the cityâ€™s vulnerableneighborhoods, there will still be the risk that the barrier will not resist,but if before building the barrier, you check your data to have an estimationof the amount of precipitation during the incoming storm, you can prepareyourself better. It is very clear how knowledge is indispensableto take action, but it is not enough. The risks of being exposed to a crisis aretoo high not to have a plan to cope with the effects. In the game, you couldbuy an insurance which helped with the cost of reparations. When peopleâ€™s welfareis at stake, protection is not enough, because once the shock has passed, it isnecessary to have a plan so the people can bounce back, or they will not beable to overcome the problem. I only played this game once, but what I woulddo different is being more strategic with the way I invested. I bought the mostexpensive insurance, which was very helpful, and I raised the protection level,but both of those choices were very expensive. The problem was that I could notdevelop in time, because I did not have the money to repair and upgrade. What Ithink I did wrong was that I did not analyze the data of each asteroid, whichis fundamental when making decisions about risk management.I do not think that it is necessary to make achange in the game. It presents how difficult it is to choose the right way toprepare for a crisis, especially since resources are limited. I understand howdata is important to decide what type of insurance is necessary, how much youcan invest and what type of protection you need.Javier Orellana"124.197.96.42,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1There are plenty of shocks anduncertainties. Every time you play, you gain better knowledge of theuncertainties. But you cannot be 100% sure of the situation. These shocks, likeearthquake or flood, are not easy to predict but they come with a certain pattern.So, to protect further damages or unexpected loss, the community must buyinsurance to prevent losses. Experienced shocks and uncertaintiesdonâ€™t guarantee the right prediction next time. Partly because there are alwaysnew risk elements, like climate change or global warming, creating more uncertainties.These new risk factors affect the weather or harvesting time or creating newand more serious flood. At the same time, when you play the game, you sometimeforget the risk and suddenly the shocks appear. Even we know the risk we justforget to buy insurance. Â Â Â There is a trade-off. You need200 to invest for a new well but you need also to upgrade and buy insurance.There are limited funds, even though it may increase (through taxation orrevenue), you can either use the extra fund to buy suitable insurance policies(one of three depending on your objectives) or upgrade or new investment. Furthermore, there is a timelimit too.2I play several times. Firstwith only 2 investments, then I try 4 or 5 investments, each time theexperience is different. Nevertheless, I need to adjust between new knowledge,protection and insurance with the limited time and fund. Very often,opportunities are lost due to insufficient fund or time. Every time, I have totake the risk against return of new investment, or consider a suitable insurance.Even with past or acquired knowledge of the â€˜misses, shocks and new investment opportunitiesâ€™,there is no guarantee I will make the right prediction. There is always a â€˜changingâ€™risk. Of course, there is always a gain if I protect myself with insurancecoverage and learned experience. Â 3If I can make one small change,I would increase the insurance options from three to five. Shocks areunpredictable and so do the damages. But we may not have sufficient fund to buythe minimum package of 33% coverage. I face this problem. I need to wait for thefund to grow but I donâ€™t have fund to buy the minimum coverage and so I have towait and the â€˜gameâ€™ time lost. Â Â One of the five options can be20% coverage. When we look at the insurance industry, there are many packagesand some even custom made for poor families, for example in India or Africa. 20%coverage with small insurance premium can help a poor community to overcomedifficulties. A small insurance coverage is certainly better than no insurance coverage.World Bankâ€™s experience in developing countries has proved that insurance doesmake a difference for these developing countries, for their farmers or factoryowners.

This is reflected within the fundamental principles of Risk Management which revolves around Knowledge, Protection and Insurance. While playing the game I had decided to concentrate my efforts towards insurance while occasionally neglecting knowledge and protection, after failing to complete level one I had shifted my attention towards insurance and protection, occasionally trying to acquire knowledge, and sometimes neglecting it completing. This too, had contributed to my inability to complete level one.Eventually, I have discovered that priority was given to risk preparation, resulting in the utilization of a tremendous amount of, already, scarce resources for this purpose, while the overall development of the village/community was neglected.In the event that I had played the game once I would have invested in obtaining more knowledge about the various risk, and the potential effects of these risk, in an attempt to have more operational coping mechanisms in place to mitigate the level of shocks which comes as a consequence of these inevitable risks. Having played that game multiple times I had discovered that I was constantly trying to find a balance between knowledge, protection, insurance and the general development of the community. With reference to protection, I would have invested a tremendous amount of effort into raising the planet, believing this to be the ""easy way out"", but due to the time-oriented nature of the game I would have realized that this approach was, by far, the most inefficient, this had reinforced that there were not a quick fixes when managing risk.Participating in this game had highlighted that risk management, even though simplified, and highly necessary, can be difficult to implement. I would have tried multiple approaches but they all would have had the same results-failure to complete level one, and even when I would have completed level two appeared to be twice as difficult. Essentially I would have learnt that managing risk is essential to development and equal considerations should be place upon knowledge, protection and insurance.Given the task to develop a new version of the game I would have included an optional price list for selecting various level of raising the planet and the corresponding cost of the same.

The game represented to a large extent a classic resources allocationdilemma (the resources here being time- for the research and credit â€“for insuranceand preparation / protection. The choices involved how much time one shouldallocate researching a given threat (which of course precluded from researchingother threats, or dedicating time to upgrade the pods), and how many creditsshould be dedicated, and when, to insurance, upgrading the pods and preparation(raising the level). It is obvious that one should take some measures to mitigaterisk (prepare and/or build a network) or transfer risk (insurance) otherwise thegame is unwinnable. I have tried a mixture of all, as one strategy alone eitherwasn't sufficient (e.g. insurance doesnâ€™t cover all damages) or too expensive(e.g. preparation). Also, building networks was quite efficient as it only coststime and not credits. I have found playing the game that investment inpreparation is at the beginning expensive, but it pays off in latter stages ofthe game. So a player with adequate preparation is able to address the residualrisk with the other measures, whereas without preparation, the game is notwinnable. In conclusion preparation, especially in the early stages allows forhigher development in the future.The main thing I learned after playing the game severaltimes was that one has to find the right mixture of strategies, depending onthe threat (the threat being a factor of chance of impact and severity) and tochoose the right response. To find the right mixture takes some time. For methe winning strategy was summarised in: invest early one in protection thatwill be repayed by development in latter stages; buy insurance for big upcomingthreats; check all threats appearing and focus research on the ones that havehigh impact and be fast in building networks; ignore (or accept) threats thatdo not seem serious, there is not enough time of resources for them; keep somecredits (I guess these would be called savings) to rebuild if disaster happens.The one thing I would change to the game is that I wouldmake more transparent the impact and importance of networking. Also, there aretwo more standard responses to risk, which would be risk deferral andavoidance. These I feel were not adequately covered. Otherwise, great job ,verydidactic and enjoyable."115.64.104.225,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"1. The risk management role in the game took the highest possible shelf. Without quick feasibility studies of, how severe is the risk, what is the potential damage, as well as the frequency of risk (meteors falling), finance and possible solution to escape losses (in this case development loss, and financial), it was not able to succeed in the game further for 1 round. The tradeoffs in this game are only few, but they present the importance of these key issues: -spend money and time in development, or on insurance policy and raise the island to escape cunami? Therefor it affected the town's development. Development took place well in advance before meteor meets the planet, and after all risks have been neutralized.Key parameter in this game played a knowledge factor, with out knowledge, it is hard to choose and make right decision to prevent disaster. 2. I, Nikita gorbatko, declare that I played the game several times. Therefore every time I failed, I had to analyze my mistakes, like, tradeoffs, add more knowledge, or time to raise the island (preparation), which kind of insurance its better to obtain (50 or 70 percent cover ratio). The last try was the most successful by reaching level 4. Firstly, I developed town in advance before meteor strikes, secondly I have spent lot of time on studying the risk (knowledge), thirdly- valuating how severe is the disaster (preparing for the worst case scenario), 4thly- obtaining proper insurance (according to previously mentioned issues), and last but not least, tried to avoid the consequences (raising the island to prevent flooding). And only after the risks have been avoided, town development continued. A3. As a developer, I would add 1 tiny thing, civilian activity + alarm system. Before a disaster strikes, civilians will have to be warned, in order to prepare for the strike and minimize civilian loss. However, if alarm system will be neglected, it will result in many victims. I think it will give better understanding of natural disaster importance, preparation and well operational team work.Â Â Â "31.39.157.225,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management wasat the heart of the gameÂ : investigating and identifying hazard(comets and sea level rise), reducing exposure (elevating the levelof security of pods) , addressing the effects and impacts (reactingin emergency situation with community links, investing ininsurances).There weretrade-offs but rather between development goals and risk managementmeasures. A mix of measures with knowledge, protection and insurance was necessary. - Research. Assoon as comets appeared, it was worth investing in research toidentify hazard (severity) and exposure (chance of hits). I have used research to win extra time to make connections but cannot assess whether this was a successful strategy. I did not spot a case wherethe risk of one comet  (severity/chance of hit) changed during thecourse of the round. I would have expected that more research helpyou to better identify the risk (reduce uncertainty â€“ betterassessing the chance of hit for instance as the comet got closer).However, I did not see this feature and the risk when the cometappeared in the sky remained constant until it crashed or not.- Insurance wasdefinitely a good deal.Â  It was better to purchase it while thecomet was getting close (which I believe does not reflect productsthat are offered by insurance companies). The price of insurance didchange between rounds but I did not have the chance to spot if it wasbecauseÂ :- my assets (pods) were upgraded (and therefore costed more toprotect) or- because the costs of insurance increased as the risk of one cometcrashing was materialising or- because my insurance had been already used once and insurers werewilling to offer protection at a higher priceMy risk aversebehaviour always got me to purchase the 75Â % insurance, I nevercalculated precisely the price of my assets (perhaps a reminder ofthe worth of what you have built on the page, would help calculatingthe right ratio for insurance). Only roughly.  The highest for a 75Â %insurance was 239 currency units, while building a pod costs around200, upgrading costs 187. So when I had 4 upgraded pods, I figuredthat insurance would be worth it without making the detailedassessment.Only once, I couldnot purchase the 75Â % insurance because I did not have enoughmoney. In addition, therewas also a problem of display in the game. Between rounds, theinsurance you had purchased and not used in one round was appearingon the screen while in reality I was not covered by insurance. Ishould have better checked that my contracts was in order.- Protection-elevating podsThis was the most time consuming measure, destracting from development goals.However, I noticed that once you had invested the time into it, itwas valid on the long-term and from one round to the other. So, this was a good investment. Nevertheless, I lost when I tried to increase my level of protection to 4. There were better ways to use my resources.LimitationsRisk management is only linked toone type of risk coming from out of space. The difficulty of riskmanagement comes from the multiplicity of risks and high level ofuncertainty and what to prioritise. So, I would advocate for at leastincorporating another layer of risk in the game. Also, some of themost important risks that mankind has to address are man-made risk.It would have been good to reflect on this and see how developmentitself bears risks (bad management of resources, climate change,toxic waste and chemicals accumulating)."79.164.36.152,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,17.0 to 30.0,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-32.0 to -12.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"Its only one way to win in this game - to use risk management tools.

On the second level I upgraded the pods and did the research but I didn't buy the insurance and as a result when the sock it, it coasted more to repair the pods and my development level fell. On level 3, the last one that I completed successfully, I bought the insurance, again the highest and elevated the terrain as much as possible, I also did the research for as long as I could.On level 4 that I didn't complete, if played again I would spend more time upgrading the pods, so that my development would rise faster and less time elevating the terrain.As to the last point on the assignment, the only thing that occurs to me now is making the elevation of the terrain faster, and not as detrimental to the development."169.252.4.21,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Game Reflection By Ajibola AkejuÂ 1.Â  Risk management technique or processes wasvery useful in playing the risk horizon game.Â It involved the interplay of knowledge, protection and insurance inmanaging the risk posed by the falling meteors which strikes the planet anddamages it. Therewas continuous trade-off between the three components â€“ knowledge, protectionand insurance, taking into cognizance the available resources for developingthe planet (represented by the available funds) in the presence of risks andthe accompanying shocks if the risk event (falling meteors) materializes.Â  There was also the interplay of the economicprinciple of â€œopportunity costâ€ù in selecting the component of risk managementto choose at any point in time considering the available resources.Knowledgeplayed an important role in knowing the severity and likelihood of damage fromthe meteor, while insurance was important in fixing the damage after it occurred.Â  Protection was also important in making theplanet cope with the shocks.Â  However,for me, the game showed the importance of insurance which we in the developingworld usually ignore.Thegame showed that preparation is the bedrock of risk management using thecomponents of knowledge, insurance, and protection.Â 2.Â  I played the game up to ten times, though Idid not go through the tutorials initially.Â This helped me in playing the game without any guide to risk managementand showed clearly the disastrous effect of not preparing for risks, because Icouldnâ€™t go past Level 2.Â  After goingthrough the tutorial and learning about the game and how to play it (shows theimportance of knowledge and information gathering), I was able to play the gameand get to Level 4. This taught me the importance of preparation and making useof knowledge, protection, and insurance to manage risks and cope with theaftermath of the shocks emanating from the occurrence of the risk event.Â 3.Â  In developing a new version of the game formy country, Nigeria, I would stress the importance of the all the components â€“knowledge, protection, and insurance.Â However, I would highlight insurance as a component that we must startto embrace in order to prepare for and cope with risk.Â  Taking up insurance is not popular here andmost people lack basic knowledge about its importance. Â Â "109.185.184.143,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,-2.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 17.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 11.0,"On the first sight, it seemed that the game is pretty chilldish and simple with all this graphics, music and the story of this little planet. My first thought as that I'm going to beat it in the first try without any troubles. Oh, how wrong was I. When I couldn't pass the third stage because the green bar on the left didn't match the expected level int the allowed time, I was confused. Why did it happen? I was sure that I didn't make any mistakes. All was going so right, all the free places on the ma were covered with my pods, that I upgraded all the time. Also, on every level i bought the 75% assurance and it was clear for me, that my little planet is safe and I'm going to have a lot of money in the future, because i wasn't supposed to lose a lot of money by repairing the pods at full cost. Still, i lost. On the second try, I realized that I spent to much time on building protection, because by the time I spent my time on lifting may pods above the water level, the bar on the left became red and my virtual country was not evolving. I understood, that the same happens in every economy. If we spend to much time and money on thoughtless and exagerated risk management, our economy and society evolve at a very small rate, or maybe remain at the same place. So, the more i prepaired for risk, the less i developed my virtual country. I decided to modifiy my strategy, and it worked. First of all, i didn't spend precious time and money on builidng an escessive protection when the time for a strong one still didn't come. I directed the biggest part of mye efforts to the development of my pods, and bought the assurance only when it was necessary. The second important thing i deduced was, that there is no nedd to build a protection of a very high level, even on the 4th and 5th stage. Instead, I tried to research the comets that represented the biggest level of risk, so, when it felt in the water, i would be prepared to build as much community connections as possible. Doing this, my protection level prevaled the severity of the comets, and after that i just put a few efforts to increase my protection by one ore two levels, because it decreases automatically after the comet hits. Still, my strategy didn't allow me to pass the 5th level, because I lacked two or three seconds to rich the milestone. So, the thing I learned from the game are the next ones:- is not enough to put attention only on one aspect of risk management (e.g. insurance); only using all of them can help us prevent and cope the risk, and by the same time have a fast development- the potential risks appear at different times (even one after another) and we can not find a precise trend (e.g. two dangerous comet can fall one after another)- community connections are very inportant in risk managementSo, if i had the posibility to change something in this informative game, i would make it a little more difficult by adding a new aspect - the conflict of interest between the members of the community, because this kind of risk is an important one in the country where i live. I wouls introduce the conflict of interests in the moment, when you are making community connections between the pods."31.47.95.3,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Risk management helps prevent or minimize loss and damages due to shocks; facilitate reconstruction whenneeded and, in a long term run, foster development. Failing to manage therisks adequately results in loss and the end of the game.Risk management is composed ofdifferent elements and finding the right balance among them leads to success.Knowledge allows to predict likelihoodand magnitude of threatening events and, though it cannot prevent them fromhappening, it can help to plan the steps to be undertaken to mitigate theirconsequences (i.e. purchasing a better insurance and increase the protection ofthe area if the risk is major, or continue developing if the risk is minor).Protection helps reduce the exposure to risks and minimize the impactof the shock, thus reducing the damages; while insurance helps reduceloss by making reconstruction less expensive.All activities require time andmoney, therefore focusing the efforts or overspending on one of them affectsthe capacity of working on the other (i.e. spending too much money on insuranceleaves little balance for building or upgrading pods; spending too much time onresearch does not allow enough time for developing or reconstructing, etc). Preparation for risk can lead tomore sustainable development, especially on a long term period. Preparation mayrequire to reduce the speed of development, as time and resources need to beinvested in research and setting up of preventive measures, but at the same timeit minimizes the possibility of destruction and the need of spending onreconstruction at a later stage. I have played several times andat the beginning it was not very easy to understand what to do. Thoughinstructions were given, they were not completely clear. In spite of beingfrustrating, learning from the previous failures helped me understand what wentwrong and to find ways to change the approach and reach better results. After the first tentative spenton rushing to put in practice all possible options and guessing the best one, Ihave started taking more time to reflect on how to relate each option to theother so as to maximize their combined effect. The game taught me that patienceis needed in risk management. Though it is easy to associate risks management to dealing with emergencies, it shall not be rushed or improvised, as management tools maybe ineffective if they are not properly related to the situation they areapplied to. From the game I have also learnt that risk management requires multitasking efforts, as different dimensions must be addressed and taken into account at the same time.If a new version of the game maybe developed I would add some connections outside the island, so as torepresent the different stakeholders engaged and their differentresponsibilities. This element would give an idea of thecomplementary/subsidiary roles of communities, states, international community,etc. in risk management."220.163.43.122,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game isthe central government, which is responsible for the development and protectionof city. BecauseÂ  I have limited resources and time, and I have to balanceamong knowledge, protection and insurance. Firstly, I should build pods toguarantee the development and enough resources. I build 2-3 pod at the firsttime, since I can not spend all my money.Â  And then I should do theprotection and keep an eye on the upcoming comets. I should get knowledge fromwatching the comets. If it is not too severe, like 1-2, Just keep watching toget knowledge. If it is immense severe, I will buy the insurance to do theprotection. I should put more time on watching the comets, since it will bringme more time to connect pods if the comet destroy the city.Â  At the meantime,I should continually build the pods. I do not need save much money on myaccount, and it is better to use the money to develop. Above level 3, If I putmore attention on protection, it will affect the development.

I will do as follows: development, protection,knowledge and insurance. I do not put much money on insurance unless the severeof comet is very high.

I will give more tips on everylevel and teach the player how to success. The last but not the least, if yousuccessful play the level 3, if you lose level 4, does not play it again fromlevel 1. It wastes time. I think the purpose of the game is to teach us how tomanage the risk, so it is important about the game design.

I find interesting that a piece of data which isnot available in the game, is how much does the income increases with eachupgrade of the pods. This is the element I would add to the game because itwould allow the decision maker to calculate better future investments inrelation with the time remaining before the stopwatch reached 00:00. More knowledgeand data availability are also components that I would prefer to have in mycountry (Mexico) where transparency is still a challenge. I played the game several times and first Iinvested all my money in developing and upgrading pods, while neglecting both protectionand insurance. The results were catastrophic. The next time I tried to balancethe investment of resources between those three options and the conditionsimproved consistently. An outstanding lesson of this game is thatknowledge is a powerful tool and it can be more useful to know how to deal withpossible shocks before they take place, than to have more money to invest in copingwith the effects of a disaster in which there was no risk managementÂ "41.78.78.2,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to reduce theimpact or damage caused by comets through the use of different combinations of Â resource allocation. The resources were to beallocated Â in research, protection andinsurance with different mix at the same time considering the budgetconstraint. As an example one might use more research but this would mean lessprotection from the hits given the type of insurance taken. Protection is howyou can protect against comets .Risk management entails that if your protectionÂ matches the severity of a comet thathits, you will be fully protected. The more time i spent with the comet selected,the more research I had will collect, but this took away time i could spenddoing other actions, hence, it was all about balancing. The more research i haddone, the more time I had to make community connections before a shock hits. Thisis another way I had to prepare for incoming shocks if the protection hadÂ  begun to cost too much money. When I purchasedan insurance plan, I knew was covered for the rest for the round againstresiduals that would befall me after takingÂ protection. Damaged growers were also be cheaper depending on theplanÂ  bought. Preparation played apivotal role in ensuring that resources were allocated efficiently to differentcompeting uses. As a result, the extent of damage was reduced allowing thecommunity to cope after a shock.Â If I were to play thegame again I would try and focus more on protection because this would increasethe chances of reducing the damage living room for insurance to play a minimumrole. I have learnt that in society we face resource constraints in dealingwith different risks, how we allocate these finite resources will determine theextent to which we are able to withstand shocks from risks such as naturalhazards. A balance between knowledge, protection and insurance needs to bereached. I also learnt that it would be extremely difficult to use protectionwhen you do not have research or knowledge about the risk you are facing which inturn will hinder your ability to choose an appropriate insurance cover.Â If I am tasked with developinga new version of the game I would make the game simple to understand throughthe use of simple language and would provide more clearer information to theplayers. I would focus more on the learning aspect of the game as opposed tocomplexity. This, I would achieve by making the game interactive, for example,when one chooses the right balance on preparation, a compliment should be givensaying ,â€œwell done, excellent or goodâ€ù, to say the least Â or perhaps giving hints in order for one toreduce the damage during the game. Â I wouldconcentrate on the specific preparation methods pertaining to drought andpoverty caused by lack of adequate rainfall as well as disease prevention asthese challenges reflect the place I live."82.226.142.203,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The role of risk management in thisgame was to allow us to limit damage the best we could while keeping a good developmentrate. Preparing for risk can affect development if wewant to prepare too much and spend too much money regarding the risk. If we dothat, we wonâ€™t have money left to develop more and to have better ways toprevent risks. In return, a good preparation for risk canallow us to keep a correct rate of development and, avoiding important damages,the development wonâ€™t slow down too much.2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  I played the game three times. Thefirst time, I was focusing a lot on risks and not at all on development. Thesecond time, I tried to spend less money in preparing for risk and on insuranceto ensure a good development rate. The third time, I tried to manage moreefficiently the preparation regarding the risks. I tended to spend a lot ofmoney trying to have no damage at all but I realize it was not realistic.The gametaught me that preparing for a risk involves a good knowledge of the risk andthat we always need to make sacrifices and make the better of the worstsituation. All is about moderation and balance. 3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  I think the role of people is notinvolved enough in the game. Protection, with infrastructure and insurance arewell represented and their role are quite accurate but knowledge of inhabitantsare not. I think the game leaves out the role of prevention towards citizenstoo blurred. As it takes place on a community scale, I would think it is quiteimportant to mention not only equipment damage but physical as well. But as thegame simplified the notion of risk management it seems difficult to embrace allaspects while keeping it simple and easy to reach."60.241.229.250,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. The role of risk management in the game was to develop Alora community by development of undeveloped pods as many as possible through different stages protection and optimizing insurance levels from comets hitting Alora community. To understand the game takes some time. Initially I could not win even Level 1 as I tried to acquire maximum undeveloped pods without paying attention to protection. But then I purchased just three pods and then went for development in stages while protecting them through raising levels and Â at least 50% insurance levels. When I had some surplus source for purchasing new undeveloped pods, i went for that. This way helped me to win Level 2 of the game. But in Level 3, it was difficult to achieve development of pods as comets were hitting frequently and the level of damage was high. So whatever growth achieved through development was not enough to raise the protection and get properly insured.2. After playing the game once, the second time my strategy was to purchase just few Three) undeveloped pods, protect them by raising levels and also insuring them at least 75%. This strategy worked well. But while playing Level 3 twice, I observed that even when I purchase just three pods for development, I was not able to protect them by raising stages of levels or insuring sufficiently as I did not have sufficient resources for level raising or insurance. This was due to rise in the frequency of comets hitting Alora and the degree of damage and cost of repairing pods. So managing resources available for development of pods while paying attention to protection by the level raising and keeping the cost of repairing the damaged pods by insuring sufficiently was the key factor in achieving development of Alora.3. While developing a new version of the risk management game, I would like to include some of present major risks faced by Â all of us. Instead of comet hitting, I would like to include scenarios of earthquakes or floods. Also, if possible, the major problem of the climate change (rise in the global average temperature) due to rise in CO2 emissions could be realistically highlighted through such game.Â In my place, which is Pune, Maharashtra in India, the management of water resources has become very important. In Maharashtra, some regions are frequently affected due to scanty rains some years and very heavy rains other years. The monsoon pattern has also changed. Every year the state government has to provide relief aid to farmers, which does not reach to affected farmers. Even after spending more than US $12 Billion on improvement in irrigation facilities in last decade, improvement is less than 1% as per the data published by the state government. So the risk management should include bringing more awareness in the people about changing the climate, which is affecting the monsoon and how they can manage risks through changing crop pattern, adopting better methods of farming using less water and taking crop insurance. This is possible if the state and central government takes lead and educate the people in managing risks and achieving development of the self and communities."86.67.16.74,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"In the RiskHorizon game, risk management helped to reach the next level of development. I hadto manage how to spend money and make trade-off between development and eitherknowledge, protection, and insurance. Actually I had to find an equilibriumbetween these four components. Knowing about the comets helped me to adjust thelevel of protection, and to cover the uncertainty by an accurate level ofinsurance. It also gave me more time afterwards to build connection and enhanceprotection.Â Preparation for risk helped me lessen thenegative impacts on my development and helped me recover faster.I playedthe game several times. Actually on first run, I put all my money ondevelopment and forgot to use research and protection. It was a disaster and Ifailed immediately. On thesecond run, I used protection by did not understand that the level ofprotection to be reached could be trigger by the knowledge about the level ofrisk.

If I ignore the risk, I am unable tomake judgement about consequences of a shock. On the other hand, knowing whatoutcomes could be helps me preventing and lessen negative effects. Whenuncertainty is high, insurance can help me face the consequences of the shockand recover earlier (in the game repairing was cheaper with insurance). Knowing betterabout the level of risk, and especially when estimation of risk was low, made me decide togrow with less fear.If I couldadd something to the game, it would be the uncertainty of money value over time.As an individual I cannot influence this parameter.

In playing Risk Horizon, I found - after many times failing at level 1 - that insurance is very, very useful, in recovering after a comet strike. I found that in order to achieve success, I had to prepare for that occurrence, and invest in insurance, even if it seemed to be Â a loss at that moment. I gladly gave up knowledge and was happy to slow down the development of the pods in order to make sure that I had the best kind of insurance that I could afford at any given time, knowing that even though the probability of being hit hard was not that big, it only takes one heavy blow to make me lose the game. One of the features that would make the game more realistic would be to not take the whole amount that is due for building or upgrading right after you've selected it, but gradually. It would be more realistic to be asked for an initial investment, that would be a portion of the total cost, and then the balance to be taken as the building progresses. I would also allow to pause the building and the development progress, but I would penalize for the pause accordingly (a smaller amount, of course).Â "111.93.155.94,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"This is a very informative and interesting game in the sense that inorder to complete my task in the given time inspite of coming across multiple obstacles like comets in this scenario, I had to strike a complete balance between all the three activities.

Assoon as I got the information regarding the severity and the chance of hit ofthe comets, I spent money in protecting Alora from possible hits.

This is what the game symbolizes and makes us realize the importance of the Risk management. Development Â for a nation or an entity needs research which in turn is dependent on technology which also is based on the resources. A developing nation or community cannot plan to focus on research avenues available for development mainly because of high investments. After surpassing the initial stage, resources can be utilized and invested in research avenues.Â On the whole, the game paid importance to between the growth in development percentage and the level of the ground barrier to be made. Also the research was essential for the community development and overcome the losses occurred during the period. The more time spent on each , the more data gets gathered. Planning and preparation towards research enables the community to showcase better communication and quicker rehabilitation. An arena which needs to be developed, also needs better communication network. For example Disaster Management Devices need to be used in disaster prone areas to save humanity and life stock. A better insurance needed to cope up with losses and essential for minimum investment. Insurance provides a better outlook and more opportunities for development. An insured person can do more work and utilize better resources in better manner. A real truth is that shows that time and resources utilized.Â That resulted in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I kept some resources for research and preparedness also. Most important, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community.Â "77.47.196.162,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk management determines your prepareness to all aftermath of disasters. In early stages more efficient strategy is readiness to results of disasters. During all gaming time you are moving on the sharp edge of blade. If you didn't pay enough attention to protection so that in next stages you will have nothing instead of new deal with insurance agency which with each round increase price of their service. You need to make decisions based on your winning from the situation, however you can't estimate how much you win or lose after disaster if you didn't experience it. That's why this game can partly substitute for us some experience and give to us new more flexible sight on problem.Game showed me that preventing of disasters and preparing to them in most cases are more important activities than obtaining of insurance payments for aftermath. Most of times I failed at 2nd or 3rd stage because I didn't mention how protection is good. Sometimes with getting insurance your cost of repairing buildings is low, but in late stages it's not as efficient as protecting. Because from stage to stage you lose your insurance contract and need to deal the new more expensive contract. And at some point you don't have money to sign insurance, and your city is defenceless. But if you in early stage were attentive to protection activities so you can leave some money for upgrading of buildings and take the cheapest insurance contract (because it will be enough). However I reached the point that now I'm always losing at stage 4 and I didn't find the best strategy. So I keep going to beat this game :)This game reveals to us how we should estimate each possible disaster and what kind of activities we should implement to avoid any damage and loss from it.

And to use knowledge and research to prepare for an imminent risk rather than protect at that very time. Also, itâ€™s worth having insurance in advance of a risk, as it gives you some resilience financially and allows you to continue development. Making community connections helped me cope with the aftermath of the shock and took me further into the game.When I played the game again, I protected myself with insurance beforehand and also raised my level of protection to only the required need, as it not only took away my time, but also dropped the bar to red. I still struggled with juggling between protection and development though. I also tried to continue developing as and when resources were available as that was the key to success.I learnt at the end that it is important to balance strategies in risk management to achieve the end goal of development and coping successfully. We must use our knowledge and research to protect ourselves as otherwise it may lead to unnecessary use of resources and also give a false sense of protection. Insurance is an excellent way of shock absorption, as it at least dampens the effect of financial shock through a situation. It also leaves you with some resources to carry on your task. A fine balance and forethought is always needed to manage risk in any situation.I would add a new feature in my version, wherein the tools of risk management would be divided based on individual, community, state and so on. This would give a better idea as to how I could manage risk at a personal level. It would teach me to balance various tools of risk management that an individual has and also utilize help provided by community, etc. It would also teach me how I could contribute to risk management in my community. I would encourage my community to familiarize themselves with tools of risk management like knowledge, protection, coping, etc..

Thegame reminds us of the importance of land-use planning, technical measures,emergency planning, crisis management, recovery support mechanisms andinsurance. Vulnerable areas face more environmental thus the need for riskassessment and hazard assessment. Its obvious manmade works cannot compare tonatural disasters. Luckily for me, I was able to utilize the $175 premium to cover75% of collateral damage.Â  Sadly, personsview insurance as an expensive option where many choose to not opt for it. I also tracked the movement of the meteor and the possible strike by the meteor. Being near the coast, the developer also must consider wave damages or even hurricane. Living in a Â hurricane prone area, I've seen people take disaster preparedness very lightly. The result usually is huge damages ans the lack of finances to repair the property. The insurance aid was received quickly.Â Initially, I found the game a bit confusing. The aim of the game was disaster preparedness, protection and recovery. Insurance and meteor tracking were the only protection measures available. Additionally, I did not understand the glow. Some levers go up as protection but no protection measure is noticeable. The pod upgrades were not well explained. The grass was appealing but is it functional for the development. Collaboration between developers, designers and management should also be included in the game. To play the game again, I would develop the property slower instead of constructing the entire site simultaneously.To add to the game, I would develop the community further away from the water. Persons would become frantic as we experience in real life and the need for food and sanitary conditions after the strike. The communication channel would be interesting during the disaster. To change some of the game, I would add more protection alternatives and add people that live in the pod. I definitely understood the work of the disaster recovery personnel. I also learnt the importance of research and predictions before and during disasters.Â In the article ""Preparation, Enforcement and Development of Disaster plans, the author highlights few areas we can follow.

Thefirst time I played, I was very confused about the game. I understood that themost important thing was to make the best decisions to protect my community,but I didn't know how to do it by the best way. I thought the meteorites alwayscould damage my community. It was for that reason I tried to have the bestinsurance every time. Perhaps I decided to have unnecessary high protection.After playing more times, I could test that it is very important to know the newrisk situation before decide to hire insurance. This game itâ€™s a good way torealise how important is the risk management and who information allows us tomake the best decisions. Risk management allows taking advantage of criticalsituations. In this game, I could check how the community was growing by makinggood decisions, investing in insurance, knowledge or protection. In spite ofthat, obstacles appeared when meteorites damaged all community building. Lackof information about how the meteorite can damage the community before it hitsthe ocean was a critical situation.When Iplayed the first time, I knew that the most important thing is to check everymeteorite before made decisions. Itâ€™s very important to have insurance, butalso to build knowledge and protection. Playing more times, I discovered thatprotection and knowledge allow more confidence. Other important question is toinvest in knowledge, building new constructions and upgrading others. Itâ€™s veryimportant to know when you have the investment break even in order to stopspending money when it doesn't give you enough ROI. Risk management is soimportant to develop this virtual community. It consists of preparation andcoping. Every time I played a new game, I acquired new knowledge and this allowsme made best decisions about insurance or protection.For developa new version of the game, I suggest to register every meteorite experience andshow us key information about how it damaged our community before a new andsimilar meteorite appears. Itâ€™s very important to have references to comparedifferent experiences and check which of theirs are similar between them. Otherthing is to know why the meteorite damages 0% the community. The question is:Why? Having insurance? Investing in knowledge or protection?

The three options respond to different strategies: with research(knowledge), I was able to gain time after the comet collision, reducing thedamages of the wave, in the game is a short-term strategy because it protectsthe village only for that specific comet. The insurance is an effectivelong-term strategy, to be chosen in the initial phase of the level for along-lasting protection. Raising the altitude of the village (protection) is betweenthe first two, offering you a valid defence by pushing the button two threetime per level. The key is a correct combination of the three approaches, which are more profitable in different times of the game: a good insurance from the initial phases of the level is crucial to incentivate development and observe the possible comets with less concern. Knowlegde when an extremely desructive comet is approaching the planet, is important to increase your post-collision reaction capacities. Protection, in the game, is less easy to define, but it permits the player not to be threatened by minor comets, increasing the time in which he can take care of the village development.2.Â Â Â Â Â Â I playedthe game a couple of times. What I progressively learned is something that Ishould have already known from the lesson: the uncertainty of the risk. Thefirst time, I relied too much on the information on the comets, trying to reactto their upcoming impact. Later, I started to prepare the village for a verynegative scenario in advance, without paying excessive attention to which typeof comets were in the sky. In the same time, I took care of the development,being sure that the bar was green. In this way, even when a catastrophic wavehit the village, the damages were limited, and the development just brieflyinterrupted.3.Â Â Â Â Â Â I wouldchange the knowledge option. I found it unrealistic that investing in researchwould have given a benefit limited to that comet. Research is, by far, the strategythat gives its outcome more on the long run than immediately after it is launched.While observing the comet, the player cannot improve neither the development ofhis village, nor the other defences, so it is a risky decision that should berewarded with a higher output in the log-term. Contrarily, protection is moretime sensible than how much it is shown in the game. Anti-tsunami protectionsrequire constant maintenance and, even when they are effective, they can faceserious damages after the waves hit them. Therefore, I would suggest decreasingthe level of the barrier more intensively after any wave.Â "46.19.228.6,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"I did not understand how to increase the Research points in the game - which in real life is essential in order to prepare for risks. I tried to develop the society as soon as possible, because higher development rate reduces the damages caused by meteors when they hit. I also always aimed for the highest possible level of insurance in order to save costs of damages if they occur. Preparation for risks slows down development, but on the other hand if the meteor hits the community and damages happen, they slow down as well. The main things I learned from the game are: important to invest in development of the society, however not on the cost of risk-preparedness. Insurance in the game plays a big role, which I'm not sure is the case in real life. I played the game four times, on the fourth time I tried to invest in fewer number of settlements but instead develop them as fast as possible. I also learned that if the level of preparedness is too high in comparison to the level of risk of the meteors, the investment is wasted. If I would develop a new version of the game, I would put more attention to the research-component, and also invent different kinds of risks (not only meteors) in order to raise awareness of variety of possible risks hitting communities. In the current version the income is created quite easily - this should be more challenging."24.138.60.156,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â Playingthe Risk Horizon game was an interesting experience in terms of enforcingprinciples from the Risk and Opportunity MOOC class. I played the game oncealong with the tutorial, and I reached level 4 before I decided to stop playingthe game. While playing the game, I was very keen on risk management and wasalways conscious of the potential disaster of an asteroid strike. I allocatedmy resources primarily to ensuring I had a large amount of time to network withother communities in the event of an Asteroid strike. In addition to investingmoney into raising the platform, I also spent considerable amounts of timeresearching the dangerous comets. I felt that this was the best strategy toprotect my colony on my first play through and I was fortunate enough to notexperience any damage as a result of this strategy.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If Iwere to play the game again, I would focus more heavily on buying insurance. IfI had purchased insurance, I would be less likely to invest money and time intoraising the platform and have more free time to conduct research and more moneyto build my colony. By avoiding insurance and investing money into raising theplatform, I restricted my rate of growth and the level of all of my buildings. Investingin insurance would have given me more confidence to take chances and growfaster, which in turn would make the game easier to beat.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  If Icould add one feature to this game, I would add a scientific prediction featurewhich allows investment of money initially to predict comet activity throughoutthe playing time of the level. By investing in research and receiving theseverity and chance of hit for upcoming comets, it would be possible to better allocatemoney and thus be more efficient. For example, if a very high severity and riskof impact comet is coming later in the game, it is a worthy investment to raisethe platform and invest in a high level of insurance. If no severe asteroidsare approaching, there is limited value insurance and protecting the colony andfunds should be allocated for rapid growth instead. This is a technique whichis widely used in predicting natural disasters and tracking the flu sodecisions about allocating funds can be made. I think this is a naturalprogression for the game which accurately models Canada, where I am from."69.248.152.238,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"1. I had to protect and insure my village of pods while I try to gain more resources and cash. It is difficult to balance protection, insurance, and knowledge because if I had to direct one attribute of my village I will have to redirect my resources and cash to it. I didn't have unlimited funds to do everything. My strategy was to insure my village as soon as possible while I try to build and upgrade my pods throughout the level, if there was a particularly high-risk comet coming I had to redirect my resources to protection until it passes.2. The first time I played it through I burned all my cash trying to build my village as quickly as possible without any protection or insurance. This had quickly led to my downfall as I didn't have any resources for protection or insurance to defray the costs of the damage. In the subsequent replays, I tried to balance all three attributes while slowly growing my village.3. If I had designed the game I would have switched the focus from a village of pods to a commercial city, I would have used commercial zones as resource gathering systems and used natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes, fire, and crime to simulate risks."201.130.71.194,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in my opinion was to place strong foundations in terms of protection and development. If you have a strong level of protection, then you can reduce the magnitude of damage, of course, in order to have an adequate level of protection you need knowledge to better understand how the â€œshocksâ€ù will affect the community and how to best prepare for it. Once all of this is done, you have the foundations needed to employ the insurance that is better suited to the situation, since the information for the transfer of resources comes from these foundations.Because oftime constraints, I couldn't play the game as many times as I wanted, so I onlyplayed until I reached level 4. After the first time, I decided to invest lessin protection as it was too time consuming and affected my progress anddevelopment meter. However, I was still stuck in the first level several trieslater, despite investing on insurance and knowledge and a bit on development viathe pods. Â It wasn't untilI started investing more on development, like building every pod and upgradingthem that I started to pass the levels. That investment increased my wealth anddevelopment meter, which in turn helped me invest more on development andinsurance, and let me have more time to observe the comets and thus, increasemy protection through the knowledge gained. Unfortunatelythe cost was the protection obtained from the lever, as it was too timeconsuming as I progressed through the levels and I valued knowledge overprotection. The comets were too frequent and numerous for me to dedicate muchtime towards protection. Theconsequences of this risk were immediately showed. Even with insurance andknowledge the damage was high. At first, I could afford it because I had enoughwealth to repair all the pods and recover the damages on the development meter,but as the comets became more frequent I didn't have enough time to repair thedamage that was continuously brought by them since my protection was low. LikeI mentioned above, time constraints prevented me from finding that balancebetween protection, development, knowledge and insurance. A change I wouldpropose on a new version of the game, one that represents the risk managementchoices that matters in the place that I live, is to simplify the way to gainprotection. I mention this because I live in the metropolitan area of MexicoCity, where, because of the geographical position, we are affected by natural phenomenasuch as frequent earthquakes and heavy rain from tropical storms and hurricanesfrom either the Pacific or Atlantic oceans. If the way protection is gained ismade more efficient and faster, the damage costs would be way lower even if itmeans that the protection would be more expensive.Â Where I live, the necessary knowledgeis available, but we keep making the same mistakes and seem surprised that weare affected by the same things over and over again like floods in certainareas and earthquake damages made from: trees planted in sidewalks thatobstructs people and are on populated sections; utility poles that fall or swayin a strong matter and by default, cause blackouts in the areas most affectedby the phenomena; and rundown buildings that weren't made to resist earthquakesdespite the previous knowledge that the area is more susceptible to earthquakedamages. Protection is definitely the aspect that needs to be worked on in reallife and according to my own experience and lack of balance, the game. Â  Â Â "192.195.66.4,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Game Reflection :The role of the risk management game was to teach how and why risk management is important for healthy development in a specific community with specific needs and urgency. In terms of knowledge, I made sure I understood shocks that may happen or hit an area, prognosticate different types of shocks, following very closely their vicious trajectories, their impact, and possible after effects which may force people to live under harsh conditions for a very long period of time.In terms of protection, I had to envision the immediacy of negative impact on the environment, how to reduce the probability and size of losses, and increase the benefits to be derived from the efforts, risk management initiatives taken to ensure viability of decision-making plans, and sustainability. Prepare those who are vulnerable to build resilience in the face of tragedies. In terms of insurance, I took great care to consider the transfer of resources across the people within the concerned community, from good to bad status of  the country; cultivating a proactive attitude, taking positive, energetic actions to prevent occurrences, and/or reducing devastating impact on development was my aim objective while playing the game, because I strongly believe that whether risks are systemic (natural disasters, earthquakes, flood/Tsunami), imposed, or idiosyncratic, development can occur only by successfully confronting risks and pursuing available opportunities, making efforts, such as updating technology, making up to date equipment more accessible, in addition to helping the people recover from losses and derive the most benefits. But in the context of the game, pods damaged from flooding can be rebuilt quicker and at a less expensive price; insurance also covers lost development time after the pods are repaired.Actually, I played the game twice, but not completely the second time; so, if I had played it fully the second time around, I would have moved in a more swiftly manner, clicking on the comets that were advancing one following the other before they reached their targets; moving in a swift manner, being vigilant, well prepared, and being proactive, while using the three powers ( Research, Protection, and Insurance) in concert with development to help create a healthy community, in addition to finding the perfect balance, are the main things I learned from the game. In fact, balance risk preparation is very important, seeing that the community falls victim to these falling comets, and we know that the shocks resulted from these comets creep into the water and cause waves that hinder development within Alora.From a risk management perspective, I would recommend the use of larger images with more specific captions for a new version of the game; and this would fit perfectly well, or best represent the risk management choices that matter most in the community where I actually live."123.3.106.200,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Risk management was represented in the game by displaying conflicting actions that could be performed in differing quantities that would either advantage or disadvantage the outcomes of the risk in differing levels - i.e the effect of a flood/tidal on a growing community from a wave caused by comets crashing into the water.Â Initially the choices I made were all for insurance and protection - I made little research into the comets anticipating that excellent preparation would protect against almost any risk. I should have invested more time into research of the comets as preparation is required in risk management, however, it is important to understand as best as possible what it is you're preparing for.Â The preparation for risk meant that the development of the community was slowed, however, when risk was prevented community development was able to continue unabated.Â 2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I played the game more than once. After several trials I ended up reducing investment in the raising of the plateau and putting more research into the comets. Once I had achieved the goal score for the level, that is when i invested more into the plateau.The main thing I learned from the game is that whilst a balance must be struck between prevention and anticipation of a risk, investing time into knowing and understanding more about the risks to be faced will enable available finances to be applied appropriately.3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The country in which I live has a democratic government with their constituents to consider - if I was to align the game closer with the community in which I live I would make every decision that the game player makes take several months or years to occur!Â ComplacencyÂ and delay by Government or authoritative bodies can severely impact on actions taken in a community. This change would be reflected in the game as a time delay for each action taken - i.e add 4 seconds prior to building a housing unit to allow for the 'council review of planning application' and/or charge different amounts for the research of the comet depending on which government department is performing the research."98.235.118.223,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Risk management played several roles within the game.  The player needs to determine a balance of taking risk to develop the community against the uncertain external risks posed by comets/water damage.  From researching potential comet impact (knowledge), allocating wave protection costs and finally determining appropriate insurance coverage, the player must balance risks and opportunities according to available resources.  These choices force trade-offs between development, conservation of resources for insurance and rebuilding while providing protection and information gathering.  Preparation played a major role in managing risk and opportunity as purchasing insurance and mitigating comet risk were critical to moving forward in development and higher levels of achievement.  The roles of risk management were present in all aspects of the game and a key requirement of a player's success in managing development.  The game also showed that it is helpful to learn from experience to effectively mitigate risk while engaging opportunities.  After playing the game a couple times, it became apparent that while developing pods, it was critical to address incoming comets as these produce damage that consumes resources and time to recover.  It is especially necessary to allocate time to protecting against comet strikes while finding suiting timing to continue development of the community.  I learned that the elements of risk and opportunity needed to be balanced to ensure successful, sustainable development.  In particular, it was far more beneficial to address comet strikes as they occurred rather than attempt to rebuild and repair after strikes.  The time and cost needed to recover far exceeded the costs to prepare and address comets and flooding as they occurred.  Preparation was key to successfully navigating the development in the risk environment.  If I were to propose any changes to the game in a new version, I think it would make sense to assign varying levels of risk to different development locations.  For example, properties located closer to the water would require increased risk tolerance, insurance and recovery costs.  Further, I would recommend differing insurance rates for different properties.  These suggestions would likely complicate the game's clear message of risk management but would perhaps mirror risk management in a manner more aligned with actual practice.  Overall, I think the game is a good representation of risk management and the functions of research, protection and insurance as they relate to development.  The concept works well as an interactive exercise to demonstrate these principles and their context in a simulated environment."41.79.219.216,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"   1-In the game, the role of risk management is to build pods while avoiding negative impacts of comets by increasing the research, either by taking a subsequent insurance policy or by protecting.I made the choice of hight protection of my buildings and very hight community connection.Prevention and risk management impact the development in the sense that the choice of development are not the same depending on whether if there are risks or not.

Developing the assets as quickly as possible allowed the player to accumulate wealth at a much faster pace. By properly identifying the risks as soon as possible, the player was able to determine immediately if more research was to be performed or if the altitude needed to be raised accordingly. If done properly, the game could be completed without buying insurance once. Once a risk was identified, however, and if an appropriate amount of of research was performed, even the most severe comets could be mitigated with no damage. This would allow the player to continue developing his society with no setbacks. Additionally, if risks were properly mitigated, and insurance was not purchased, this allowed the player to continue allocating a greater share of his resources to develop the society.By playing the game a few times, I was able to quickly determine which comets needed more research. I learned that identifying and researching risks before they become an issue, I could forgo insurance. This allowed me to proactively develop the society, rather than react to damage caused by the comets. Additionally, once I had achieved the required level of development for each level, I would spend the remaining time and money -- comets permitting -- on raising the altitude of my city. This allowed me to start each level at a generous amount of money (accumulation outpaced protection level increments) and at a much higher level of protection, affording me the ability to spend time researching risks and developing my society as soon as I had enough money for each upgrade. I ran pretty thin levels of wealth in order to beat the game, but did so without insurance because I spent most of my time mitigating risks.If I were tasked with changing the game, I would allow the player the option of various levels of research and protection (altitude) instead of various levels of insurance. Because the game may be beat without insurance -- and because most insurance is full coverage -- I would like to give the player the ability to research comets at a quicker pace, but obviously at a higher cost, as well as the ability to increase protection at a quicker pace. In my opinion, this would be more realistic because with certain levels of wealth you can afford to throw more resources (people) at a problem. This is done so because higher levels of wealth allow for a better educated society, thereby affording the society the ability of tackling much larger, more complex issues."14.139.92.146,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management was key to success in this game. Thedevelopment was progressing in an environment that was prone to naturaldisasters (strikes by comets). In this environment having an effective riskmanagement strategy was a must. The development involved costs in the initial phasethough it quickly started paying off. Similarly, risk management also involvedcosts, but it paid off in terms of limited or no destruction from naturaldisasters. There were three tools for risk management: research, insurance andprotection. Research revealed the probability and severity of strike. Insurancewas available in different levels and could be bought depending on theavailable resources. Similarly, the amount of protection could be changeddepending upon the forecasted severity of strikes. Clearly, each of thesechoices involved costs and involved setting aside resources that could havebeen used for development. In the immediate phase risk management seemed toimpede development by setting aside resources, but in a later phase riskmanagement seemed to have paid off when there were limited or no losses becauseof the adoption of a sound risk management strategy.I played the game more than once and I believe that myefficiency increased in subsequent trials of the game. For one, I was morewilling to adopt insurance despite the seemingly high costs. Further I was ableto allocate resources properly by focussing on research. For example, ifresearch showed that there was no possibility of strike, then I could divertresources from protection to development. Further I learnt time management e.g.I knew when to be on high level protection mode and when to be relatively atease. In short, I was better at deciding the trade offs.If I were to design a new version of the game, I wouldpropose an addition to the existing risk management system. I would introducethe tool of institutional capability. Building this tool would involveresources and at the same time one key input of this tool would be a ratingdenoting the way in which prior disasters have been handled. Thus institutionalcapability would involve some fixed expenditure per unit time and may alsoprovide some resources at the onset of disaster. The rate of growth ofinstitutional capacity should be linked to the cumulative scores of howprevious disasters have been handled. If a disaster has been handled badly(based on some loss parameter), the cumulative score would decrease. Theobjective of adding this tool to the risk management mechanism is to reflect onthe collective and institutional learning curve."24.104.127.1,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,n/a,"Initially, I had plenty of trouble with the game. I tired many different methods but had trouble getting past the second level and only rarely, getting the bar high enough to reach level four. In this game, you have to manage risk while balancing it with development, much like in the real world. You can not spend all of your resources on protection or on research because then there will not be sufficient money, time, or other resources to build or upgrade the pods. In reality, you would be best off having ample insurance. During the game, I combined both high and low levels of insurance with more or less focus on other protective management tools in different game attempts. Ultimately, I discovered that the lower insurance policy was best because it is better to prevent, or developing ways to minimize effects of shocks, instead of having to deal with it afterwards. Concurrently, as the tutorial mentions, it is best to repair the pods immediately after the comets cause the damage. It is possible to succeed with the broader, more expensive insurance policy, but I did not find it effective because I would save more money by preparing for the damage.Â I tinkered with different amounts of research. Some times I was constantly doing research, which hindered my developmental efforts. A couple of times, I tried doing no research(which worked surprisingly well for the first couple of levels, as long as you have the highest insurance). One game, I immediately set all my efforts on raising the ground, but the protection was not enough for my underdeveloped civilization to thrive. On the other hand, disregarding the protection option is damaging especially with consecutive dangerous, comets. Â I learned that there is not just one answer to risk management, but none of the choices are perfect. There are extreme sacrifices and a balance is difficult but necessary to find. This is obviously a simplified version, but I came into the game thinking that knowledge and trying to prevent disasters were enough, but problems will still occur and you will have to deal with the repercussions regardless. Developing the civilization was a hard task as well. If we were given an already civilized territory where we had money and resources in which to develop risk management, it would have been much easier. This is why there is a correlation between GDP and preventive measures in the international community.The game is too much of a trial and error. The game ends if you make one mistake early of even if you just get unlucky with a couple of disastrous comets back to back. The game would be more realistic if the player was only allowed one chance but the civilization is on a larger scale. One mistake would not be game ending and you could more easily see how the choices you make, the costs of opportunities you choose to pursue, effect the community.Â "115.248.181.157,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game was a pure Risk management game.

Even if seen in a real world, wealthy economies can tackle risk in a better way because of the larger amount of resources available.2) Cheap insurance.3) Easy up gradation."116.72.154.245,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Â  Â  Â  Risk management played a very crucial role in ensuring that the planet can grow and prosper without the fear of damage. At the starting of the first level itself, I bought the 75% insurance cover. As I built my pods, I kept an eye on the comets (research) and increased my protection to match the severity of the potential disaster. Also, the research helped give me more time to create community connections. Due to these reasons, none of my pods suffered any damage during all 4 levels of the game I played. The resources spent on preparation helped me to utilize all the remaining money for development without having to save money to spend on repairing. Although initially I invested in heavy insurance and protection, it eventually paid off and despite curbing my ability to grow in the immediate future, I was able to then develop better ahead.Â Â  Â  Â Â After playing the game, I realized why it is so important to manage risk well. I came to know that when you take the necessary precautions and have a safety net, you are able to develop better and jump higher, without fear of failing. While playing again, I realized that there is no one common solution, as every time, there are different situations. Every choice requires a trade-off between available resources and the other possible choices. Due to achieving a proper balance between knowledge, insurance and protection, I was able to optimally utilize my resources, protect my planet and utilize existing opportunities to continue to ensure its development.Â Â  Â  Â  Â I think the concept of financial risk is something that is important in todayâ€™s age, along with natural disasters and other concerns. Iâ€™d like to add a more finance-related component, such as the ability to take loans (at a margin of current development) and make deposits in case of excess funds (the term being a few seconds upto a few minutes) and different rates of interest on the same. I think that added complexity would bring the game closer to the one we play in our daily lives.Overall, the game helps practically apply the concepts we'be been studying in the past two weeks (risk management using knowledge, insurance and protection), and thus understand how to make decisions to manage risks more effectively, and achieve our goal of development."189.196.197.52,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,30.0 to 33.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,12.0 to 37.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"The role of risk management in the game isÂ giving us a very Â good example of the real situation speaking of taking and managing risk.

In this game we found all the notions around risk management, with the knowledge (staying on the meteor to see how the risk evolves), the protection (with the bar) and the insurance (which we had to buy). All of them have a cost in time (knowledge) and in money (the 2 others). The trade-off actually consisted in how to balance all of these factors in order to limit the damages and to have to spend less money to cope at the end, and in the meantime continue to develop (which is the optimal goal). So basically, the question was : should i spend more money in protection and insurance, and not develop enough my economy, or should i develop it as fast as possible but then face huge risks without protection. Then, the problem actually consists in how balancing protection and insurance, and in the meantime observe the meteors to obtain a more precise idea of the risk, but being unable to prepare for the possible crash.2. At the beginning, i basically didnt know how to balance everything, and i didnt know what to expect from the danger of the meteor. I spent most of my money in protection and lost it because of a slow development. I then tried to balance it a bit more effectively, but i still have the tendency to spend more money in insurance and protection. I was basically fearing big damages, so i tend to buy the most expensive assurance, even if i could play some levels without any crash at all.3. We could definitely implement some other concepts of the risk management, for example with the obstacles. The knowledge is already developped, the more time we spend looking at the meteor, the more pricise it gets. But we could definitely consider implementing the environment, with for exemple others nations all playing together, and thus design a collaborative game. Some actions could Â be taken together, they probably would have a larger impact than the individual ones. Then, each decision would have an impact on the other countries, such as the price of repairing when there is already limited ressources. Another idea would be to develop other risks, and also other possibilities, such as moving to a less risky environment, or moving to a more risky but also more profitable. They are actually many choices, but it becomes then technically too difficult to play ..."202.78.143.18,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The game Risk Horizon, provided a simple interpretationsof the choices and opportunities faced by those managing risk. While playingthe game I was able to make use of all three aspects of preparation â€“protection, knowledge and buying insurance and to use the community as a copingtool once a comet had hit. I was also able to increase my earnings and myability to pay for protection measures later the game.The game was quite simple but demonstratedthat rarely is risk management perfect, there are choices to be made, significantlybased on resources. My ability to implement protection (raising the land level)and buy insurance was based on my finances which in turn were based on myplanets financial resources (the number and level of sophistication of my pods).I often had to make a call as to whether to invest in protection or to buyinsurance, or to upgrade my pods, reducing my current finances but increasing myresources for the future. Â As the game progressedI learned that â€˜perfectâ€™ was rarely needed in order to get through and make itto the next stage â€“ rather you had to make the most of the resources at yourdisposal and what you know about the extent of the risk. A good level of riskmanagement was possible without having a full a gold plated solution. The trade offs in the game reflected thosefaced in real life by people, communities, government and the internationalcommunity. Choices have to be made when resources are limited, as to whether toput limited funds into insurance (and the extent of it), protection â€“ such asflood defences, or stronger buildings or into taking opportunities that enablebetter risk management in the future - schooling or a new business. The impactof an incident on protection levels (decreasing them) also reflected the impactof real disasters on existing protection measures such as infrastructure andservices.Knowledge and coping strategies wereslightly different in the game to protection and insurance as, as in real life,they are less dependent on resources. Gaining knowledge in the game did take meaway from efforts to improve protection and insurance, but were not asfinancially dependent. In real life, knowledge can also be spread relativelycheaply through open access to information and both community networks and technologies such as the internetand social media.Â  Coping similarly did not appear to be dependenton my finances but made a significant difference in the impact of events whenthey happened, reflecting the importance of strong community networks for thosefaced with risks and opportunities. Living in New Zealand, the importance ofthis was shown in the aftermath of recent earthquakes where community spiritplayed a significant role in sharing resources such as housing and providing psychologicalsupport after the event. This is an element of risk management that hasmultiple benefits not just improving peopleâ€™s ability to cope in a risk managementcontext.I think the key element I would change inthe game is to increase the variety of risks, opportunities and preparationmeasures available. The differing strength of comets did reflect this to anextent, but if more variety were provided it would better reflect variety ofrisks and opportunities faced by individuals and communities and the variety ofpreparation tools available. Rarely are people just facing â€˜cometsâ€™ coming fromjust one direction with the same preparation methods required or a small numberof trade off to be considered.Â "31.205.16.82,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-63.0 to -36.0,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"This game was about development in the the time of uncertainty. Development of a settlement was challenging because of constant threats from the meteorites and damages they cause through I assume floods and earthquakes. The game is in line with the real world, where development of societies in hindered by natural disasters. It reminds me of an example given in one of the videos of week 2, where speaker talks about Mumbai and constant floods and also mentions Haiti earthquake.Â Our role in this game was to become ""Chile"", to make development possible even when the disaster strikes. This could have been achieved through buying insurance or raising the ground of the settlement as a way of protection. In my opinion, research we had to conduct about the meteorites was also the way of protection because it enabled us to better know our threat and prepare for coping with it. To achieve that we had make certain trade-offs. Most notable ones are tradeoffs in resources, where to allocate them, and in time, how to use it. When it comes to resources, we could have build or protect ourselves. The tradeoffs I made were based on the information I got from the research of meteorites. Depending on their severity and a change of impact I made a decisions either to buy an insurance or to protect the settlement. Here I noted that in case of great severity of the damage meteorite will cause and in times when this impact was certain, the best way to protect yourself was to build a protection. However, this approach took me time and resources I could have spent on a development. That is why in my second attempt I tried to balance between protection and an insurance, in a way that I was trying to get protected just enough to stay safe from the mediocre dangers that will cause me small damages, which are easy to repair and will not take a lot of time to repair. But, at the end I did make a mistake, where I allowed too much of damage that took me a lot of time and resources to cope with, and eventually cost me progress to finishing the game. To summarise my finding, I learned that investing too much on a protection and insurance will cost me a lot in terms of development, but not investing at all would not allow development to occur at all. The right approach would be to find a resource and time balance between protection/insurance and development, and that could be achieved only with the right amount of knowledge. The game actually did show this value of knowledge through this game of connection of green dots after the impact, and it proved that more research leads to better protection.In conclusion, this game shows the challenges people face in a real life and is a offers a good basis for understanding risk management that will lead to opportunities. I believe that this game could improve if developers would add unexpected events in a way of a third party help in terms of resources, or the event that might also slow down our development. This would better simulate the real world, where this unexpected events do occur and are usually very significant. Good examples would be change of political parties or sudden donations/help from let say Red Cross orÂ United Nations.Â "88.114.94.130,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The main components of the risk management concept from thecourse were very well presented in the game: the knowledge about the comingrisk and the parameters of the comets, the options for insurance andprotection, as well as coping with the effects by creating connections withinthe community. I chose to spend my resources on insurance, research andupgrading my pods and it proved to be a good combination of investments. Preparationfor risk helped in reducing the damage and thus creating better conditions fordevelopment. I think the positive effects were noticed immediately in theaftermath of the incident of comets hitting the ground when one did not need tospend too many efforts and resources in recovery and rebuilding the community.The first time I played the game, I did not spend time doingthe research, so I failed very quickly. Subsequently, it proved to be apowerful tool for preparation and helped me in my next trials. I also spent my availableresources on regular insurance at each level and constant upgrades of the pods.What I learned from the game, is that finding the best option to balance yourresources and the necessary level of protection is a difficult task. Protectionand insurance come at a price and connecting the community is another way toincrease resilience within the group. I also learned that confronting the risk isinevitable, but if enough efforts are spent for preparation, coping with theaftermath effects could be a feasible task.If I could propose a change in the game, it would probably be to diversify the risk â€“ instead of having the constant risk of the cometsperhaps presenting a dual risk could be more realistic. I believe that a goodoption could be introducing droughts and floods as potential risks to the community. Inthat way, one has to make different choices depending on the expected risk and itseffects. Unfortunately, these risks are also very present in the last decades inall the continents and cannot be ignored anymore.Â "76.119.204.233,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"What was the role of risk management in the game?The role of risk management in the game was to prepare for meteors, and cope/recover when they did hit. This was acheived through raising the ground (protection), purchasing insurance to offset the cost of prepare (insurance), and researching the comets to determine risk (research).What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?I often had to decide between expansion and protection/insurance. I could either spend my money on expanding my buildings or try to protect or get insurance for them.In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?I was able to recover much more quickly after disaster, and in some cases I was even able to avoid damage at all. This however was at the cost of slowed development while preparing for risk. My overall speed of development did increase when preparing for risk, because there was significantly less ""lag time"" when trying to recover after a disaster.If you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time?At first I was overly cautious and bought too much insurance and spent too much time on protection. As a result I had little development in my buildings and was unable to meet each level's goal. The next time I played I tried to balance risk preparation and development in order to safely meet goals. This worked much more effectively and allowed me to pass the first few levels.What were the main things you learned from the game?I learned that risk management is not always so simple. You have to balance risk and growth if you want to survive because neither can work on their own. In addition the best way to confront risk can vary and there is never one clear cut solution. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The ability to move location to another part of the planet would be a nice addition. This would cost money but allow for different amounts of comets to hit.Â  This ""immigration"" would be risky because you might end up in an area that is more difficult to live than the original, but it would also have a good chance of being able to provide more protection or less comets."89.7.196.87,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to find the right balance among research, protection and insurance.

What I learned from the game is how difficult is to balance the three issues confronting risk management.I would propose to reflect policy bureaucracy and corruption by adding some kind of widget that would make decisions more expensive (budgeting) and become slower by grading those issues with a percentage level (low, medium or high) over the standard level for developed countries."202.58.180.34,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Basically this game is very interesting. Interesting because there are many things we can learn together. I really like this game. This game makes me more and more to like about management risk and want to learn how to create an opportunity into success. Management of risk in this game has a very important role. We can make a priority that can be done when idle to face disruption or disaster. Of the three elements that can be used, namely knowledge, protection, and insurance I could make a priority to minimize the negative impact of the disaster. The first time I did was make a purchase insurance. Why purchase insurance? It is very clear that when the disaster came, to fix everything needed funds. If there are things that can be covered by insurance, it would be useful to reduce the cost at the time of repair. Then protection. It is also important to be able to minimize that when a disaster or disruption coming, the negative effects can be minimized. Even its exposure to the public that there are, in this form of protection is to reduce the negative effects that appear not to eliminate the negative impact. And the protection afforded should be is the best protection, so that people there can be a safe, quiet and alert when the catastrophe came. I played this game a few times. which is different in each game is a strategy that I do to try to get the best results. The best results in question is how to reduce the negative impact of the disaster. and eating six pieces I managed to reduce the negative impact of the disaster. Maybe at first I did trial and error to get the best possible way so that the best results can be obtained, which is to minimize the impact negetif. I need some time in order to get the results I want. When we can get the best way, we can perform a standard operating procedure so that when disaster came, we've been able to act in accordance with what will happen next. Whether it is a difficult thing? It must be hard, we may now talking at the level of the game. But when it's there and it actually happens will be very difficult. But no matter what happens we must be ready. I forgot about the research. research is also an important thing that must be done. With the research we will be able to gauge what will happen and how to best response. When compared with the state of current reality, especially with the situation that I experienced in Jakarta. Maybe if I was given the opportunity to provide input to the games we play, I want to add a feature there is the death toll from the disaster-affected or the disorder. In addition I also mlihat that these games can be made if we become governor where there will be a number of casualties, so that the governor's reputation as a person who plays the game can become a better feel for the situation that occurs when the disaster came. When a game can be made more complicated maybe we can get a lot insght that we can get about the risks and opportunities when disaster strikes. please note it is a disaster in my country are common. Almost in every year in Jakarta always get flooded. I feel concern for jakarta if the rains come. Therefore I always prepare mentally and logistical preparation if the floods come to jakarta. I have to do is buy a lot of instant noodles, took the money in the bank, and move goods to higher ground."41.57.121.6,6.0 to 10.0,0.0 to 2.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game is that it helped me plan for unforeseen damage the comet could cause to the community development using different level of protection, insurance and knowledge. It also make me understand that in planning for risk, one has to incur some cost orÂ resources (cost for insurance, time spent on protection and acquiring knowledge). Risk management involves undertaking certain level of risk (because you are not sureÂ of the outcome ofÂ your action)Â to achieve success. But this does not guarantee a hundred percentage at times.In developing the community, there are few choices madeÂ like purchasing insurance, or increasingÂ your level of protection. All of these depend on the severity of the hit whichÂ can be detected or known by clicking on the exactÂ cometÂ  moving towards the earth at a particular time. Click onÂ the cometÂ to check the chances of hit and the severity of the hit. Each of this hasÂ 10Â barsÂ beforeÂ it. Checking this bar help determine the level ofÂ preparation to make in order to counter or manageÂ theÂ amount of damage that can be caused by the comet. For example, if the severity of hit is high maybe on scale 6-7 and chances of hit is also high on scale 6, it is best to purchase insurance for the pods already developed and also increase the level of protection to a scale higher than that of the severity of hit by one (1). The logic is done by always making your level of protection higher than the level of severity of hit. You can also upgrade your pods.I played the game more than once. I actually started by developing the plot of lands, purchasing insurance and neglecting the fact that I had to increase the level of protection. And when the comet struck the pods were destroyed which shouldn't or couldn't have happened if I had increased the level of protection. Although, the cost of repair was reduced due to the insurance purchased earlier. The second time I played, I tried developing the land,Â increasing the level of protection to commensurate with the severity of hit and sometimes even higher depending on the chances of hit and it really worked well. But when the severity of hit and chances of hit are high, I had to purchase insurance to cover up for any damage and also increased the level of protection. The lesson learnt here is that to manage risk you have to combine different resources (knowledge, insurance and protection) not just depending on one say insurance alone.If I had to propose a better risk management that matter in the place I live, it will be against flood. In the area that I live presently, houses are built without proper layout and drainage system. Whenever it rains, the road gets flooded easily and this has in turn led to the gradual degradation of the roads in which the residents are incognisant of.Â Â And most of the time when there is a heavy downpour water floods the houses and not only the road as earlier said. I have planned to schedule a risk management plan meeting with the resident association to carry out plans to mitigate against any future re-occurrence ofÂ  flood in the area. Plans include contributing as aÂ community towards constructing good drainage system or making it compulsory for every resident to construct a drainage system in front of their houses."218.212.106.206,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,1.0 to 17.0,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"In Risk Horizon, I had to balance the the costs of comet strikes with the benefits of developing my pods.If I spent too much on prevention, I would not have enough money to develop my pods and complete the game. However, if I did not spend enough, I would end up spending more money on repairs anyway. Research on the comets was another trade-off, as I could not do anything while undergoing research, yet doing the research meant I could afford to spend a bit less on raising the platform.The final trade-off was insurance. If I was going to protect my pods to a large extent, investing in insurance wasnâ€™t worth it. However, if I was willing to let my pods get damaged a bit, I could save a lot of money by buying insurance instead of raising my landDirect preparation for risk - in the form of raising the pods - retards development, as it consumes money and time that could have been spent developing the pods. It is also an opportunity cost in terms of responding to the most immediate threat, researching the incoming comet. However, the benefits of appropriate - and not excessive - preparation saves a lot of money as well, in the form of money saved on repairs.If I were to play the game again, I would probably spend less over-preparing for comet strikes, as it consumed a lot of time and money. Spending more time researching the comet would have given me equal results. My money management improved as I played through the levels, as I was more familiar with the costs of each action, and the frequency of strong comets. Additional knowledge and experience allows me to make more informed choices with regards to the probability of an event occurring, and allows me to prepare accordingly.If I could add a feature, I would include a record of all past comets that summarises the frequency of different strengths of comets for even 2-minute interval that is updated with every comet that passes the planet, so that the player can make also choices based on historical data and past trends."180.154.230.202,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was to need to balance the three parts of protection,knowledge and insurance.

After I recognized the protection is the main job to help the development as well, I started to balance the development, insurance and protection. What I learnt from the game was that any kind of risk can cause the development slow down whatever level insurance I bought.

I feel that I focused heavily on coping with loss --but did not do enough to prevent the loss from ever happening in the first place.I read through the instructions twice before starting the game --but still felt that it took the first two simulations before I really grasped the concepts and objectives.

It is necessary to observe history of possible damage in case of being struck by a meteor.By preparing for risk,investing on protection, research as well as purchasing insurance which became moreand more expensive as the game progressed, development was affected moneywise as not enough funds were left for development immediately. Upgradesgradually took longer and longer to be completed besides more expensive.In addition to financial resources, time management also played an important issue, as many decisions would have to be taken simultaneously.I played the game more thanonce. When I played for the first time I focused on development and protection and ignoredresearch. So after the first game, I invested more on research and tried to balance out mychoices more prudently so to have protection and development evolving alongside.The main thing that I learntfrom the game was that knowledge is crucial for development. Knowledge on meteros helped me to prioritize on protection, or upgrade whilst not losing focuns on development.By investing in knowledge,you are investing in development and tackling any potential disruptions such aspotential meteor catastrophe.I would add the droughtelement along with pest growth, which is seasonal where I live, however it isresponsible for causing destruction, death and seriously affecting crops, which therefore results in food price increase if there is a shortage.In this case, whendry season comes it is necessary to have a good irrigation system as well asgood pesticidas to fight against pests. In this case, investing on technology should be enough to upgrade the irrigation system, however research on crop pests would be required to to find out what the best pesticide is. It is known that pests grow stronger with pesticides so constant investment would be required.Â Â Â "139.193.23.84,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"This game really frustrated me.To be frank, I had tried to play the game more than 30 times, and only succeed to reach level 2.Most of the time, I had failed in level 1.

As the leader of the community I had to make decisions, I had to economize the usage of the community's resources between researches, protection and insurance. In my opinion the main purpose was to make choices under uncertainity and optimise the usage of resources to protect the city.I had to make choices and compromises because in each round I had limited time to achieve all the goals (develop the community, do researches, build protection). Every action costs money and time - which is really a rare resource in this game. On the basis of my reasearch I gaind information about the severity of the meteors and checked my protection level. In case I realized that my level of protection is not enough I had to stop doing researches earlier. I bought insurance in every round so that I had the opportunity to make a lot of community connections when my community was hit by a meteor.Preparation for risk affected the development of my community immediately when I had only a little money which I spent for Insurance. I had to wait and collect more resources to spend some money on protection or on development. Building protection always made my pods stop developing. I'm not sure but I think that making the more research made the pods develop faster.After I played the game once I decided that during the next games I'm goning to buy insurance and balance more carefully between recearch ang protection. I tried to develop only some of the pods and leave the others on a basic level, but in this cases the development level was not enough. I learned that it is important to develop your community balanced and equally to reach a healthy level of development. It was important to have protectionÂ too, beacause without protection the community got damaged and I lost someÂ time while re-building the pods. Research is important but it is impossible to monitor all meteors on the highest level, in case I had 6 or 7 meteors I checked all of them and monitored (researched) the more sever for a longer time.If I had the opportunity to add something I'd like to add a more specific feedback at the end og the levels. For example in one of my games I got really severe meteors, so I decided (after buying the average insurance) to buy the highest level insurance too. And at the end, after loosing the level I got the message that ""If you would like to protetct the community you should buy insurance"". Sometimes it is annoying and not helping the player to understand what was wrong or not good enough."67.86.223.124,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The role of risk management in this game was to help mitigate risks and provide opportunities for development. The way I happened to play the game was to spend most of the resources on insurance and the development of pods. The reason behind this was to advance the cause of development in order to reach the goals. I used whatever money remained was used for last minute protection, as any very strong comets arrived. The immediate impacts of preparation for risk were to slow down development due to a lack of resources; on the other hand, preparation for risk in the long run actually improved development because fewer resources were used to fix damaged pods, thus speeding up development. The first time I played the game was a bit of a disaster; I was not aware of how to develop the pods. After going over the instructions, I was able to work on developing the pods, I also made sure to have a good balance of insurance and protection. I think I ought to have used research more. I learned about the balance required in risk management between insurance, protection, and research in order to mitigate risks as much as possible; I also learned how effective risk management could help promote development. The final thing I learned dealt specifically with protection, and how protection in certain circumstances could actually slow growth; this, I believe, was specifically referring to environmental protection, and how in the short term it can hamper growth and development. If I were to make an addition to the game, I would have liked to include an aspect of private enterprise. As someone from the United States, private enterprise plays a key role in certain aspects of risk management. I would like to see how private enterprises could aid in development by building pods of their own, and I would like to see how private enterprise can actually cause problems when it comes to risk management due to misallocation of resources and the withholding of information. "72.15.30.50,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Playing this game wasvery challenging. The instructions were not precise enough. At first, I did notunderstand the risk management aspect; I was too busy trying to understand thegame itself. But after numerous tries, I was able to have a betterunderstanding of the risk management aspect that was presented. The role ofrisk management in this game was presented through the different optionsavailable towards one single goal, a sustainable development. The latter was characterizedby combination of knowledge, growth, protection and insurance. It was importantto find the right combinations to ensure a continuous growth of the communityafter the different obstacles.At first glance, itseemed obvious for me to increase the protection, in order to nuance theimpacts and prepare for the next comets. However, I quickly understood that itwas not an effective long term solution. Trade-offs was highly important. My strategywas to start by building the community (three at a time), then add an insuranceto lower the cost in case of an impact, and finally raised the protection. Â Preparation for risk, as it was presented inthe videos, included different factors such as knowledge, insurance andprotection. If I had played thegame only once, I would have start paying attending to all the other options.It is easier to just focus on the obvious option (which was enlarging thecommunity) than to think outside the box and incorporate all the possiblefactors that have an impact on the final result. Â On the other side, if I had played more thanonce I would have strategically combined all options. Combine the option alsorequires a precise timing. I had a very difficult time, understanding when toact and when not to act.Â  But overall, Ilearned that different factors get involve to produce growth and I also learnedthat community support is majorly important. Resources, as we might thing, arenot always the only problem; therefore as a risk management agent, I shouldlook more closely in all factors. It was a good game;they were able to present a close version of a community struggling foreconomic growth. However I have some recommendations. First, to have a moredetailed instruction on how to play the game; then to explain how the communitysupports work and allow the support to happen even before the shocks andfinally to allow the community to be relocated(far from the border) as apreventive action.

It was easy for level one to threeÂ but became progressively more difficult moving up levels. I tried high levels of insurance, mid level of protection in order to keep production on schedule. In some cases it worked. Research was the weak point. A high degree of likelihood for impact could sometimes result on no impact at all. In essence, there was two sets of ratios to manage. One was the information on the meteors, the other was development on the planet. Other factors were the variable rates of speeds of the meteors related to speed of development at each level. Â I would imagine a back ground in science and math would be of benefit in this game. I did determine that high cost of insurance and protection slowed production at higher levels. on top of that shocks and the severity of shocksÂ were more frequent. The clock gave no mercy. development needed to happen at a rapid pace in order to generate capitol to protect and insure. On the positive side, I did manage to synchronize the variables in order to save the development fromÂ destruction many times. In essence,Â I was looking to set the safety parameters and progress with production with out a lot of recalibrating. But that did not work all the time. In some cases I fell into reacting to what turn out to be a poor plan from the start. In cases I won and lost.Defining risk and its severityÂ of negative outcome underÂ very narrow time constraintsÂ combines with calibrating the tools of development, protection and insurance was my biggest challenge. I guess that is the name of the game.If I were to change the game, I would increase the knowledge or research aspect of the meteors. Out of a value of ten most research never went beyond one or two. So it would appear to me, the weakness that that I had as leader, was 'knowing what was coming down the pipe.' Perhaps that is a luxury that does not happen in many cases with natural of financial shocks for example. So better planning at the protection and insurance phases are necessary. This would shift my focus now to having abetter understanding of calibrating insurance, protection and development all against time constraints.In my community, in 2013, we had the most expensive natural disaster in Canada's history. It was a once in 200 yearÂ flood. A freak, very heavy,Â two day down pour dropped it's load over our community catching weather forecasters by surprise. Which is interesting considering the high level of technology and knowledge of weather forecasting today. The other aspect that caught the city off guard was flood mitigation infrastructure. Drastically ill prepared. A lot of that has changed and is in the process of change. Massive efforts and investment are underway.Â But, if I could suggest one change to implement, that would be to challengeÂ people's fascination and romance of livingÂ close to rivers that have histories of flooding for millennia. In centuries past, rivers were vital for transportation, food and life itself. So having close access was vital. Indigenous populations were migratory and could pack up and move at a moments notice when flooding was near. European settlers chose permanent structures. Now we still live next to these dynamic and powerful hydraulic systems called rivers and fail to build houses with insufficient flood mitigation technology. Year after year, decade after decade, home owners are always shocked that their properties are damaged by the latest flood. When choosing a home, it would appear that many people do not take topography, geology or geography into account and all of the naturalÂ components that interact with in these systems."174.53.178.26,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,1.0 to 17.0,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-12.0 to -5.0,3.0 to 11.0,"Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Game Reflection ExerciseÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Throughoutthe game, risk management needed to be planned well and executed due to thedifficulty of later levels, and to some extent the earliest levels.Â  In my successful attempts at playing thegame, I focused on using early resources towards two plots of land andupgrading them as soon as possible while also maintaining the protection bar4-5 bars up in order to avoid damage.Â Elevating protection any higher was too costly and slowed down theprogress bar in reaching the next level, which led to multiple failed playedattempts.Â  The multiplying factor inconnecting the community was essential for the protection bar to be effectivewhen comets struck; therefore I needed ample time for the connecting mini-gameand required high research of dangerous comets.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thefirst few played games resulted in early failures around level 2-3.Â  This was due to filling all the land plotswith low level villages and keeping the protection bar high, within three barsfrom the highest protection level.Â  Ialso spent money on insurance in all of the early levels, yet this was neverutilized due to high protection levels resulting in no damage.Â  This resulted in resources beinginefficiently used and leading to failure after two or three rounds.Â  I learned that saving resources for insurancein later rounds was necessary towards successful completion of the six roundsbut was detrimental in the earlier rounds when there was little risk that theinsurance would be used to cover damage costs.Â After finding the right mix between when insurance was needed and how muchprogress and money should go towards protection levels and time researchingcomets, I found advancing levels much easier and less frustrating than thefirst few game attempts.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In a revised version of this game, Iwould add a village readiness mini-game that is different than the protectionlevel.Â  The protection level can relateto how a public institution or the local government aims to keep theircommunity protected; however I believe the readiness of citizens to be preparedwhen needed and/or have the awareness and knowledge on how to act when adisaster occurs can have a huge impact on lessening the overall damage doneafter a disaster hits.Â  This is why theuse of emergency drills in communities under constant danger, either due tonatural disasters or outside actors, is so prevalent around the world whenhistory has shown that communities are most vulnerable when they are notprepared for unforeseen events.Â Emphasizing village readiness in a mini-game would highlight one of themajor insurances that cities employ around the world to best avert damages inthe aftermath of a disaster.Â  Thoughthere are some costs to increasing readiness through public tutoring orinforming citizens, as well as staging large-scale emergency drills; the costsare still likely to be less than large insurance plans to cover futurepotential damages."27.251.167.146,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"Answer to Q 1.Â Risk management defines the mechanism of confronting the risk, preparing for them and coping with the adverse affects. Here comets are like the shocks which affecting internal and external environment of the planet alora resulting in adverse outcome. With reference to the game the interlinked component of risk management picturedÂ nicely withÂ community development by building and developing pods, facilitatingÂ research regarding the severity of comets which pursues application of knowledge aided research thereby receiving more time to protect the community and providing 3 different insurance cover for the same.Lastly the benefit of risk management over weigh the cost of resources to cushion the development.In the game i choose all the 3 choices to proceed in the next level.Preparation of Risk affecting development is not for short term. It affect development immediately as protecting the planet alora from shocks but it should be envisaged further to harness the developmentAnswer to Q 2.I attempted the game twice. In first attempt, I failed in level 2 owing to not acquainted with the procedure of game. In first try i haven't take any insurance cover and moreover i haven't increase my protection against the severity of risk. But in second attempts i used all the interlinked components of risk management like developing and upgrading the pods, take insurance cover of 75% which incurred me less cost regarding reconstruction of pods, uplift the ground level more above the sea level so that the severity of risk cost less damage to my community and apply more research to each comets thereby getting more time to build and upgrade the community of alora. Â More you uplift the ground and involved community development and up-gradation, more is your development of alora and with increased power to withstand the severity of risk. But the process of managing the risk comes with the cost of resources. With respect to cost benefit analysis the benefit of risk management is more than the cost incurred. Moreover protection helps to reduce the probability of the size of losses and increase the benefits. And lastly proper insurance cover helps to repair the pods thereby adjusting the cost against the severity of risk.Answer to Q 3.For further clarification of the choices of risk management I propose to introduce different insurance cover for different comets. And in terms of changes i want to adjust the level of severity with the increase of research. With pursuit of knowledge one can also prepare for the risk thereby in better position to cope with severity of risk. So more the knowledge and research will increase, less will be the affect of severity of comets hitting the ocean floor."213.89.9.58,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"I-Risk managementâ€™s role and trade-offs:Risk management in RiskHorizon aimed at balancingallocation of resources between preparation to potential shocksÂ  - protecting the Alora community against fallingcomets that may hinder its development - and healthy development - by buildingand upgrading pods. Tobe cost-effective, a comparison of the cost of an upfront intervention to thepotential benefit should a shock occur, had to be weighed by the probability ofthat shock occurring.When preparation for risk was poor, theconsequences of a materialized risk were costing time that could be used for otheractions, and most importantly, allocation of assets that slowed down/decreaseddevelopment. Preparation (research, protection,insurance) on the other hand was also costly, while the benefits were notalways certain:Â 1) Improvingwarning systems (the severity and chance of hit) through research, not onlyhelped estimating benefits versus costs, but also increased the potentiality ofbuilding community connections that drastically reduced post-impactconsequences. Focusing on comet research was free but took time, whichsometimes could be used more effectively elsewhere.2) Protective tools(elevating the island) cost resources, and the time spent protecting Aloratemporarily slowed down its development.3) Moreover by obtainingan insurance plan, damaged pods were quicker and cheaper to rebuild. Purchasinga more or less covering/expensive insurance depended on the communityâ€™s budget,its level of development, and the severity and chance of hit, which knowledgeof was linked to the time spent on research.Finally, risk preparation in theshort-term negatively affected pods development, in the sense that fewerresources were allocated to their growth. In the long run however, risk management appearedcost-effective in many cases, and increased economic returns, by reducing therisk and reparation costs altogether, leaving more resources available for investment in risk management anddevelopment. Â II- Learnings and changes of action:Playing more than once, several changes andrealizations struck me: After severaltrials, I decided to develop Alora more progressively, adapting the podsâ€™update to their protection, as I realized this method was more cost-effective,but also because the more were the pods updated, the more my resourcesincreased in a short period of time. Secondly Idedicated more time to research by focusing on the comets, as I had realizedthat it gave me extra time to increase community connections, which would decrease/eliminatereparation costs in the event of an impact. Finally Idecided not to systematically purchase the most expensive insurance at everyround, balancing this decision with other tools available (research/protection),and with the probability of the risk materializing. To wrap-up, Ihave learned to prioritize and choose between key parameters affectingcost-effectiveness,Â  as I becameincreasingly aware of the necessity to provide a benchmark for the value ofaverted damage to Alora.Â  Â Â III- Development of a new game versionand risk management: Preemptivemeasures in the game are adequate to Aloraâ€™s risks; however the symbolism ofthe falling comets - if it were to happen where I live - would be a globalcatastrophe, which is why I would find international cooperation to be ofupmost importance.Inthe game, this would translate into introducing several cities/communities thatone does not necessarily see, but that you can trade knowledge, research, andeconomic data with. For example, Alora could sell its research to other citiesand vice versa against resources. This new tool would support the articulationof potential benefits and costs for improved decision-making.Â "41.203.69.1,0.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was huge in the game. In fact, the game in all fairness is all about risk management. The game from the beginning to the end entailed all the components of risk management as explained during the lectures. The components of risk management include: Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping. I made made a number of choices and some of them include creating a healthy environment by accumulating the pods (development), which shows on the balance scale (left lower side of the screen) and preparing for the threats/attacks which are represented by the comets in the game. In terms of knowledge, protection and insurance, certain trade-offs were made. For example, while I was creating a healthy environment, I had to trade-off certain amount of dollars (resources) in other to ensure that the impact of the threats/damages is reduced to the affordable minimum through insurance. At other times, I ensured that knowledge was sought through research so that the impact of the potential threats (comets) was known before they actually took place. In this way, certain measures are put in place to ensure adequate protection. Preparation for risk affected development immediately it was done. This is because while preparing for risk, there is a little delay in the time that was meant for development to take place through the upgrade of the pods. Moreover, the resources that were used in preparing for risk also had some effects on the general development because they could be otherwise used for development. However, in the long run, they rate of recovery i.e. coping that was experienced made the impact of the threats/hits lesser and therefore allowed for quick recovery.Whenever I play the game again, I would ensure that more provisions are made for risk management. This is because in the game I played earlier on, I focused more on upgrading the pods (development) without adequate preparation for risk management. Needless to say, I didn't really purchase enough insurance to cater for the losses that may result from the hits/threats. Most times during the game, this happened as a result of underestimation of those threats (risk) and tendency to keep the money that should have been spent in the form of insurance. My efforts on protection by pressing and holding the key on the right lower corner of the screen was also not encourage, I swung into action for protection too late. When next I play the game, I would ensure timely protection, adequate preparation for the risks by carrying out research on the impact of the threats at hand and then continually develop my environment. In short, I would ensure adequate balancing between Knowledge, Protection and Insurance. Once this is done, greater rewards are gotten. While potential attacks are totally prevented or their effects are largely mitigated when they eventually happen, rapid development takes place in the community and the resources are therefore wisely invested without more focus on certain areas of management compared to the others..It's a very great game. Though simple, yet very tasking and informative. Supposing I'm saddled with the responsibility of changing one or two things about the game, I would possibly add vibration to the sound and this will happen immediately the threats i.e comets hit the water to indicate attack. In this way, the fear of an attack will make the game more engaging as the player would be much more conscious of attacks. This way, the game becomes more realistic and therefore creates a considerable psychological effects. With this, this game becomes more exciting and real than it is. A great game!"76.178.136.231,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Iplayed the game twice, but I couldn't get past level one. The object ofthe game was that you had to build your buildings and watch out forcomets which could potentially damage your buildings. In order toprepare for risks you had to protect your buildings by raising yourcity up and buying insurance in case damaged was taken. Because Ionly had so much money, both times I played I sacrificed building sothat I could protect the couple of buildings I did have. You couldresearch each comet to evaluate the threat, which helped some. But nosooner was I past a minor threat, when a bigger threat showed up. Anactual hit put me back financially and slowed me down from being ableto build more. The first time I played I felt that insurance thatoffered 50% coverage would suffice, but when more dangerous cometsappeared I found I needed more insurance. I had four or fivebuildings that time, but I lost really quickly. Only three of mybuildings were upgraded. The second time I played, I purchased the75% coverage right off the bat, but that then decreased my moneyright in the beginning. I could only build three buildings, and Ithink I might have upgraded one. All this is done against a timer,which I pretty much negated, since I couldn't really survive thecomets, anyway. There's a specific balance needed in order to buildyour city, as well as protect it, and then insure it on top of that.I think I could achieve that, but it will take another couple oftries. I think one change that could be made that would help the gamebetter represent real life would be to take into account theindividual buildings. Currently in the game, if there was damage froma comet, I could quickly just repair it before the next comet (Itried to always save money for repairs, if nothing else). Withindividuals to take into account, there's then the possibility thatthe people in one building wouldn't be able to make the necessaryrepairs before the next comet. If previous comet damage, or any otherunrelated expensive decision, left the family too broke that theycouldn't make the repairs in time, I could end up just losing mybuildings. In other words, make it so that I send the money forrepairs to the building, instead of just directly making repairs.Then, put in a time limit for how long it takes for a building torepair. Some buildings will get repaired, but one or two will takelonger, and so you have to work harder to protect the town. Thiswould be an annoying change, however. Although I support peoplehaving their freedoms to make their own decisions, it would be reallyfrustrating if you had to sit their and watch people not be preparedfor a potential disaster, especially when you are trying everythingyou can to protect them.Â "95.223.17.254,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 17.0,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"Question 1:Therole of the game was to showcase how preparation and development for risksinfluence each other.

After that was done I worked on the development ofthe houses. Onlyafter that I went to research the comets. Ihardly used the insurance option, as insurance only helps with the aftermathsof a catastrophe, but doesnâ€™t help with preventing it.Preparationfor risk (elevation, research and insurance) lead to having not enough time formaking sufficient progress on the development scale. Thepreparations undertaken for risk prevention vanished after some time and had tobe invested in again â€“ only development was stable and did not decrease againonce it was achieved.Â Question 2:Â Idid play the game a couple of times but was never able to finish it. Most ofthe times I did get until level 6, but failed only a few steps on thedevelopment scale.Ithink I even know where I made the mistake, but was never able to make itcompletely right: Becauseespecially during the last two levels it is highly important to not spend toomuch money on preparations but invest most of the money into developing thehouses â€“ as all (?) houses need to be fully developed to successfully finishlevel 6. Ialways wanted to be on the save side and kept the elevation of the ground high(first pink block) â€“ but the increased number of comets in the last levelscaused the plateau height to decrease constantly and I invested too much moneyinto keeping it high.Thegame is all about finding a good balance between undertaking preparations forpotential risks and developing the community.Â Question 3:When Istarted playing the game I thought that the houses that were closest built tothe ocean would face a higher risk of damage by floods. Hence I always startedto build the houses on the right side of the plateau, furthest from the ocean.But during the game I learned that that was an element that did not have anyinfluence on the game. So to makethe game more realistic, I would add the element of â€˜proximity to waterâ€™ as anessential element to the game as it is also very relevant to risk management inreal life.Â "62.145.89.76,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"MY GAME REFLECTIONI can say that the main role of risk management for this game of Alora world wasthe identification, analysis,assessment,control,and avoidance,minimization, or elimination of unacceptable risks. Through this game I discovered how and why risk management is important forthe development of society or country. I learned by research, protection andinsurance howÂ  to develop alora community to the best of my ability whilemeeting milestones to comets threaten. but despite obstacles, I tried to fillmy development bqr by building and upgrading pods. and this procedure helped meto learn and undestand how to coordinate economical qpplication of resources tominimize, monitor and controle the probability and impact of unfornate naturaldisasters.In terms of knowledge, I reduced the chance of the comet hitting until the impactand I received more time of information to create community connections rightbefore the comet hits: this method helped a lot to boost the protection. And interms of protection; I pressed and holdÂ  the slider, located on the bottomright of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.Through this, I prevented the pods from being damaged by matching the level ofprotection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider.finally; in terms of the power of insurance; I prepared for high severity cometby buying a plan. I mean, by obtaining insurance, pods damaged from waves ofcomets were quicker and cheapper rebuilt. this helped me to recover lostdevelopment.So, for the most part, these methods consisted of identifying; characterizingthreats of Alora community, assessing the vulnerability of critial assets tospecific threats, identifying ways to reduce those risk and prioritizing riskreduction measures based on a strategy. And my choice was to build and upgrade more pods so that I might fill fasterand increase the amount of wealth. this helped me to continue keeping the metergreen by trying to reach my goal of passing another level.Concerning the trade-offs I confronted, I can say that it was not easy to beatthe level in the sense of reaching the indicated on this development meterbecause of the time and also I did not know how to reach the goal in time. Therefore, fromthis game I learned following two elements:1.Â Â Â Â Â  After establishing the context, thenext step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risksare about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, riskidentification can start with the source of our problems and those of ourcompetitors (benefit), or with the problem itself. Once risks have beenidentified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impactand to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple tomeasure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know forsure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring. 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk management regarding natural disastersÂ : Itis important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods causedby comet like in Alora community, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster riskassessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, But if they asket me to developÂ  a newversion of this game, I will increase more money of insurance and to introducepeople in building and upgrading pods. I will try to reduce level.In summary, I can say that this game helped me a lot tounderstand in practice the risk management."69.243.107.142,10.0 to 66.0,0.0 to 2.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Understanding RM through the game was really a new experience for me. Although I understood the components of the RM, implementing them was quite hard for me. I have tried the game several times till I managed passing level one and then moving to level five. During the game , I faced some of the obstacles such asÂ lack of resources, time and knowledge. At first I started by spending too much time protecting the village through raising it up which did not give me time to research or have money to build and develop. Then I tried concentrating on developing first and researching which still did not give me the chance to protect and prevent damages. Having too many comets attacking as well did not give me enough time to protect my village. Through my trials of the game, I learnt that even by gaining knowledge I still could not prevent the hitting of the comets , but I can lessen the damage or prevent it by buying the highest insurance rate. So, the first thing I did in the other trials was starting with the insurance package to be on the safe side. By this , coping with the shock was easier and less damage happened and sometimes none. At times, I had to make trade-offs by sometimes choosing not to spend too much time on protecting and rather spend it on researching. This helped me with money that gave me chance to build and develop more,but did not give me too much time as comets were increasing on numbers. At my last successful trial I understood better how to balance between my choices. So, I started by the insurance,then building two pods and increasing two levels of the island, then immediately researching to help lessen the damage which actually helped. Then again in building other new ones and continuing with other one level of raising and my researching after that. So, by balancing between each component I managed to succeed and reach level 5. I was very happy with the different choices I made and how better to balance through my choices for improvements.Regarding how to upgrade the game, I would like to present some suggestions. First, I have seen that through clicking on the research button, the comet window should keep opened and so nothing else could be done till the research be done. As in reality , one person won't be doing everything at the same time and so I suggest by just clicking on the comet, the researching will be done automatically without having keeping the window ,to give time to do other things as well. Second, to offer as an extra privilege protective shields to be built on the buildings as a means of protection in case of comets that could not be prevented but at the same time keep the buildings safe and better coping with the attack. Lastly,having other means of resources to get money from to help in the developing. In conclusion, the game was a challenge for me. It gave me an insight regarding the risk opportunities I needed to take. The more I spent time in my developing beside my research, it helped me more to protect my assets.It also taught me that not everything shock in our community could be prevented but by learning to how to cope and where to invest more helped in passing through the shock. And so by balancing between the components of knowledge,coping,insurance and protection was I was able to keep my community safe and so do better choices for the future. Â  Â "86.50.95.64,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Firstly, in the game, the role of risk management is veryimportant. It decides the development of community, and how quickly a communityrecovers after a disaster. Specifically, in the game, I had to make choices to decidewhich one I should invest money on: the development of the village (build andupgrade more houses) or I should spend that money and time on the knowledge,protection and insurance. If I build and upgrade more houses, I will have towait until the wealth is enough to do other things such as buying a package ofinsurance and raising the land higher, which means the investment on thesethings will be lower compared to when I spend all of moneyÂ  on these and neglecting the houses. Althoughthe preparation for risk affects the development, it is just a matter ofshort-term view. It is true that the development will be stopped at the momentto leave the side for the protection, getting knowledge and insurance as theresult of the opportunity cost; but it does not mean that the development willbe ignored forever. All the protection plans and insurance are the way to makesure that the development of your community can last as long as it is possible.Remember that only a good preparation plan will assist the security so thatpeople can feel safe to work and develop. Moreover, I concluded this after I had played the game threetimes: I spent more time to do research on the comets and I became more awareof the sky, even though the sky was clear and lack of comets, when I wasfocusing on building the village. Also, I tried to buy a full package ofinsurance though it was expensive as if something takes place, I got more thanwhat I paid. One thing I learn most in this game is that an accident/disastercan happen any time and the severity can be different from the lightest to thetoughest. I should always have some backup plans before and after the badthings happening to me. Finally, if I have a chance to add one thing in the game, Imay want to add the cost to the research on comets. I realize that when youresearched the comets, it didnâ€™t cost anything except for the time. In fact, itshould have cost something, not much but we do need money to do a research inreal life and this will emphasize the trade-off between the development andgetting knowledge, protection and insurance. Furthermore, in Vietnam where Icome from, the importance of insurance is being neglected. People rather keeptheir money than using it to buy insurance. It mostly roots from the lack ofknowledge about the severity when something bad takes place. It is not aboutthe money because even when they have money, they still donâ€™t want to spend iton the insurance. There should be program to educate people, to make themrealize that they definitely will spend more when an accident happens to themand/or the government can loan/support the families who cannot afford the insurance,especially farmers. In the end, the neglected habit and lack of information aremain features of poverty and slow development. Â Â Â Â Â Â "50.174.36.80,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,1.0 to 17.0,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 11.0,"Every community is faced with threats and risks that may endanger the whole society. In some cases, the main problems are natural disasters, in other cases those are social disorders, fertility rates, economic collapses etc. In our game, where the main story is happening on the Alora planet, the main threat to the community are falling comets which can affect this community in many aspects, for example by causing floods. Thus, the role of risk management in this game is to struggle with those threats by making the adequate balance between available resources - research, protection and insurance. Â If the right choices are made, the community becomes safer and lasts longer.At the beginning of the game, I put the main emphasis on the use of insurance. Therefore, most of my actions were pursuing insurance and relying on it. I thought that the most efficient way to protect the Alora was reduction of material costs of reparation after damage, without any serious engagement in protection and research. Unfortunately that was wrong. The only result of using resources in this manner was inability to compensate the damage after the accumulated shocks. Then I have changed my strategy and started to pay more attention to research and protection, with really low use of insurance. After that, the things have started to change. I researched a lot, and as a result of that I reduced severity and possibility of shocks. This means that we have to be familiar with characteristics of our environment and also with specifics of the threats our community is faced with. After a while, it was obvious that the most important aspect to focus on was protection. The protection is the main objective and all our efforts should be put towards reaching it. After I had raised protection bar to the highest level in combination with knowledge gained from researching, I just had to maintain the existing condition and to keep on upgrading pods. Thereby every effort to build strong protection was very valuable.By playing this game, I have learned that if you are not well prepared and if you donâ€™t protect your objects adequately, you will probably lose a lot . Because, no matter how much money or insurance for repairing you have, if you let things be destroyed and just wait and hope that damage will not be devastating, you wonâ€™t be able to live any legacy behind you. We should not wait for things to happen. We have to be well informed about our environment - natural and social, and be prepared to meet their necessities and to try to develop and improve technologies for safer facing with the future. It is important to explore as many comets as possible and in this game I did not have enough time for all comets I wanted to explore. Thus, If I had the chance to add something to the game, it would probably be a possibility to research at least two comets at the same time. I think that would improve researching conditions and provide better results."190.60.212.134,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Really, it is a very interesting game because from the information we have, we can mystify risk, using tools such as insurance, engineering.

The aim of the game, which is to maximize development by minimizing damages due to potential risks, is very much in line with the goal of risk management.The latter as we all know is all about increasing the benefits and decreasing the losses that people experience when they face risk.Once a risk or a comet was seen on the horizon, the first thing that was done, was gaining information about the potential of the risk. Next came the choice or rather the trade off between protection and insurance. Both were a must and were resorted to, much before a risk appeared, but the proportion in which each is to be used, greatly varied depending upon the severity of the risk.  Effective research and preparation for risks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment for future safety. Insurance not only means protection but also facilitates the necessary repair work, whenever there are damages. Apart from all this, effective coping mechanism (promptly joining all the golden ovals to each other once a comet was hit) greatly mitigated the possibility of any damage.It is important to bear in mind at all times that development is the prime concern.Developmental activities must go on at all times. Repeated iterations on the game would make one more adept at striking the right balance between protection and risk. It will make one more prompt in development activities as they are the source of fund and eventually time translates into money, so the faster the development happens, the more money one gets. It will also make one more fluent with the coping mechanism. It is also important to understand here that as one reaches higher levels in the game or as society reaches a certain level of development, it needs more fund than before to protect itself from potential risks and to grow further at the same time. Therefore at those levels, the magnitude of risk management should also increase accordingly. Even though the game models risk management very well, a further scope for improvement cannot be ruled out. There could be more variety of risks in the game. Apart from comets and rising water levels, there could be earthquakes and so on. Opportunities could also be dealt with similarly. There can be a sample matrix correlating the risk with a given severity, the damage protection levels, and the level of insurance required. This will reduce the random noise factor in the game (specially in making a choice between protection and insurance) and will make the decision making more effective."59.165.151.3,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,-36.0 to 1.0,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"1)The game has an inbuilt system wherein one can find thechances if a comet is going to hit or not and what would be the severity of thehit. This gives the user a change to manage the risk. The user can conduct aresearch every time since the comet shows on the horizon. The list on the comet gives the player an idea about theseverity of hit and chances of the comet hitting. This gives the player achance to build a strategy in terms of research and protection . A comet havingno chance of a hit can be avoided and the resources can be directed to thebuilding of pods.2)I played the game several times.

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The trade-offs included time â€“ it took time to research the comets and the time could be used to build or repair pods. Therefore I tended to spend little time researching the comets â€“ I sacrificed knowledge. I bought the insurance level I was able to and typically ignored the comets. The insurance meant that it was pretty cheap to repair the pods which benefitted development. I wasnâ€™t able to make the protection scheme work but if I had I think it also would have involved a trade-off of time. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time?

If I were to play the game again I would wait a little bit longer to accumulate enough money to buy the medium level of insurance. I didnâ€™t learn anything from the game but I believe it was intended to show that repairs and improvements are both cheaper than building from scratch and that insurance is a wise investment because in the end it reduces overall costs. I believe it was also intended to show that investment leads to faster development even though it initially appears as just a cost. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?The Oregon Trail is a very old game that is also about risk management. In it, a family leaves the east coast of the United States in a covered wagon. The family must purchase a mix of supplies. The mix chosen is obviously based on the risks the player believes will be encountered. The player has to choose between really basic items like food, ammunition, a spare wheel, and medicine. The risks range from running out of food, getting bit by a snake, being attacked, and having an accident that damages the wagon. Real life similarly has multiple risks and not every one of them can be prepared for equally and the element of chance means no player has perfect or even adequate information for predicting. If I were to add one element to the Risk Management game it would be to add lives.

Also, time was a handicap to achieve the construction and the protectionof the pods. I wish I could had have the opportunity to create my own money orto decide how much I could use, not just waited to get it without my owncontrol, I think this situation was the one who most affected my achievement.

The game illustrated the value of preparedness and insurance coverage but also the complete randomness of natural disasters and severity of their effects.The game illustrated the role of risk management by allowing players to purchase insurance and/or raise their buildings to higher ground in order to limit the damage from comets hitting the planet. Purchasing insurance and raising the land cost money and thus diverted resources away from building pods, which were meant to represent ""development"" and produced an income. Also, because the protection method (ground raising) required players to click and hold a button, this prevented further actions such as building new pods or upgrading existing ones. The benefits of insurance and protection was that the damage from comet impacts was reduced and repair costs after the impact were lower with insurance than without. The drawback was that investing in protection depleted the development bar that indicated the level of development needed to progress to the next stage.Thus, the reduction in damage and lower rebuilding costs acted in a similar way to the payments made to Bangladeshi farmers to cover the cost of their bus tickets to the capital to look for work in the off-season; although in this case the same person is making the investment and reaping the benefits, it allowed for the possibility of a large payoff in the form of reduced (or no) damage to the pods and thus more money later on to upgrade or build new ones.After a few initial attempts where I failed to progress beyond Level 1, I ""got the hang of"" the game and started to make progress to the second and third level. After initially investing too much in insurance and protection, I altered the balance of new development and insurance so that development goals would be reached. However, at higher levels, even having Level 3 insurance policies and several bars on the protection meter did not prevent some extensive damage from comet hits, even those of moderate ""severity"". A comet hit, especially with a few seconds left on the clock, made it very difficult to recover and rebuild to move on to the next stage.While the game does a good job of highlighting the unpredictability and severity of natural disasters, it does not adequately reward players who are well prepared. It seems to make more sense in many situations to just focus on building so as to exceed the threshold development level by a sufficient amount to cover for last minute disasters, rather than depleting resources by investing them in insurance. I would tweak the game to reduce the depletion of money and development points for investing in insurance. This would allow players to reach and exceed development targets by a large margin and prevent a late disaster from wiping out their investment, rewarding those who managed risk better, while punishing players who simply build their way to the next stage without taking any protective measures."196.216.144.45,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk Management help me to confront the risk of comet and destructive waves in Alora Island while developing.To do this I chose to allocate my limited resource among; research on comet hitting and destructive potential predictions, procurement of policies, raising the elevation of the Alora and speed of development.

In real life this type of knowledge is essential in just about everysituation of life. Countries, states, cities, households, and businesses mustknow what risks they face and the likelihood of them occurring before they canprepare to cope with them.Again, in the game we had the opportunity to implement protection against the known shocks andthe expected severity of those shocks. In real life as well, once we know whatrisks we face we can implement protection. In the game the protection was toraise the island from the waves caused by a comet crashing into the ocean. Inreal life the protection we implement will be as varied as the risks we faceand the organization we are protecting. For a family it may be protection fromunemployment by using continuing education to improve skills and employability.For company it may be necessary to protect their computer network from hackersand viruses. Also like the game, in real life the cost of implanting the protectioncould be prohibitive to implanting the needed protection.Insuranceprovides us the ability to transfer resources from good times to bad or inother words, in between shocks we should take some of our resources and savethem to help us cope with the next shock. One of the best ways to do this is topurchase insurance such as life insurance, health insurance, propertyinsurance, or flood insurance. Utilizing commercial insurance companies allowsus to leverage our resources because a large group inputs into the reservewhile only a small group at a time need to use some of the resources to copewith a shock. Obviously if more is going out than coming in this will insuranceprinciple will fail. Besides commercial insurance we as individuals can saveduring good times to be better prepared for potential shocks in the future suchas unemployment, injury, or retirement.The game also illustrated how important it is forcommunities to develop connectionsto help each other cope with shock. This has been seen internationally in caseslike the earthquake in Haiti when many countries rushed to aid in the recovery.Like most of the other principles discussed here these connections areimportant for families as well as other organizations to help each other copewhen the others are impacted by a shock."197.253.66.186,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAMEÂ The Role of risk Management in the gamewas to tackle the likelihood of shocks happening and their impacts.

Indeed developingand implementing risk management plan is cost effective.Â Since the goal risk management is tomitigate the losses and improve the benefits that people experience when theyface risk and opportunity one cannot compromise on the combination of thesethree actions: acquiring Knowledge,obtaining protection and obtaining insurance. However protection and insurancemay create synergies or require trade-offs.Â The quality of information with less ambiguityleads to investment in early warning indicators and contingency planning toimprove emergency response which in turn complements insurance which serves asa shock absorber.Â Preparation for risk affects developmentin the following waysBetter knowledge inform decisions about investments in     skills and educationLong term forecastingImprove productivityImprove investmentIntroduction of new technologies Resilience to shocksSaves livesQuick recoveryÂ Thus with good preparation, only minimalcoping may be needed to recover quickly leaving more resources available forinvestment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks.Â In the subsequent attempts, the followingwere consideredEffective planImplement the plan by embracing     thinking and adopting a new way of workingLessons learnt upon reflective practice includesRisk is inevitable in     developmentShould be tackle head-onRisk management is cost     effectiveTime management is essential in     risk managementEffective and efficient planningBroader thinkingMonitoring and evaluation (internal and external)PatienceBe realisticÂ Â The change I recommend is indicators forrisk in public place.Â Â Â Â "41.178.154.4,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management roleincludes knowledge, development and insurance; from my side I tried to work ondevelopment building and fixing however, risk is too high which bring hopelessto the mind, somehow feeling like, why should I fix if immediately after fixingdamage is higher!!

I did enjoy the game even though I do not actuallylike playing computer games because it takes almost all your attention. The Role of RiskManagement in the GameThe main role of risk management in the game, is to create abalance between Knowledge, Protection Insurance, and coping (repair sharing) to deal decisively of uncertainties. I was confronted to decide or to choosebetween insurance, protection and knowledge in order to manage risk effectivelywithin specific time. Each of the risk tools comes with a cost, and such youshould be mindful about your choices. In the game, I would have wished to takemore protection in order to manage risk but it was impossible because there isthe need to balance the three main tolls given to manage the risk. In the sequenceof the game, I realized that sometimes your inability to properly apportion theresources available would end you not been able to complete the level as aresult not manage risk well. There was an instance where I have to purchaseinsurance but I had already exhausted the resources, therefore I was not ableto secure the required insurance such made effective risk management at thatinstance not achieved. In some instances, you have to forgo development inorder to prepare for risk only to realize it did not occur. In the game, therewas a time I have to do more research, purchase more insurance and protectionbut the comet did missed.Â What to DoDifferentlyTo be frank I played the game about six times or more thinking I would beable to complete all the levels but I could not. I was able to complete onlylevel two. After the first and second games, it became eminent to me that Ihave to ensure balance between acquisition of knowledge, ensuring protectionand securing insurance and that is what I did. Though the three go in concert,sometimes looking at the severity of the comet you can ignore insurance orprotection.Â  Knowledge is what I thinkshould be acquire always no matter how less severe the impact would be, the reason being that having knowledge worth a million .The Risk ManagementChoices That Matter in the Place I LiveIf I am tasked to develop a new version of the game byadding one simple risk management choices in my area, I would add the religiousbelief and their cultural background of the people in that area. I will alsoadd opportunities that comes with risk. Â Â "50.197.41.97,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"I found the Risk Horizon game interesting and educational inthe realm of risk management. Even though the premise of the game is simple thegame quickly becomes challenging as you try to balance developing the city withprotecting it from meteors. I found it difficult to meet the â€œgoalâ€ù for eachlevel because of the hard decision of whether to spend money on development,insurance, or protecting the city. I had to play the game several times just toreach level four, which was the highest I completed. I tried severalstrategies; multiple structures with little protection, one structure with highprotection, and just a few structures with medium level protection. I was most successfulwith the last option with the 50% insurance option. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thefirst approach, building the maximum pods, left little money over forprotection or insurance. When a meteor hit the damage and repair costs werehigh. This approach made it possible to meet the goal of each level unless thedamage from a meteor hit was too costly. This development approach is similar toareas that expand rapidly but have catastrophic losses when disaster strikesdue to few protection measures. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Thesecond approach, building one or two well protected pods, limited the amount ofdamage from meteor strikes but made it hard to meet the level goals. This wasbecause the protection cost money which meant those funds were not adding tothe goal. Due to the high level of protestation the damage from the meteors wasminimal or prevented. Cities and countries often set development goals forthemselves either as monetary (GDP, Export Amounts etc.) or demographic (urbanpopulation, employment rate, literacy rate, disease prevention etc.). In orderto meet these goals, officials must balance funding them versus fundingdisaster (risk) prevention measures.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The thirdapproach, medium growth with mid-level protection and insurance, was successfulfor me in this game and probably the most realistic and probable in the realworld. By only building and maintain a few pods, three to four, I still hadmoney left over to buy the 50% insurance and the mid-level protection. Becauseof the protection and insurance, when a meteor struck the damage was not as badas with no coverage and the insurance covered half of the cost. The knowledge(research) obtained by studying the meteors was helpful because of the extratime for connections after a hit. However this took away time that could havebeen spent adding pods or protection.Â Because Risk Horizon challenges the player to expand their citywhile handling natural disasters, I find this game a good simplifiedrepresentation of challenges that affect developing areas and how risk managementcan aid in their development. The game makes it obvious that there is a delicatebalance between meeting development goals and providing protection againstunavoidable hazards."142.11.81.199,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of the risk management game was to make a player multi-task in contemplation, making preparation and taking action. Â The risk that had to be taken was whether to take time to research, spend money on raising the village, spend money on insurance or spend money on building. Â In the beginning I wasn't sure if I should build up one home large scale until completion and then continue to add another home at a time and build it up to completion, or whether to build all the homes at basic level and then build each home up a level as a group (aiming to upgrade them all to the same level at the same time). Â I decided it would be best to use however much money I had to make any improvement to building new homes or building up the homes. Â As it was cheapest to build a new home, if I noticed fast enough that I had just enough money to build a new home, I made that choice. Â If my money had already increased enough to build up an existing home, I made that choice. Â In the beginning I also waited for my money to increase to buy the best insurance as soon as I saw a threat coming. Â After losing a level I changed my strategy and tried starting out by purchasing the cheapest insurance, and then focused to upgrade the insurance if multiple threats or a monster threat with high probability of hitting was approaching. Â If I could change the game I would give the player pop up clues of what to consider when threats arrive or when the money in the bank increases, while they play in level 1 and 2 to help the player catch on to the strategies. Â I assume and believe from making it to level 3 that the strategy is to build up as much as possible, and not keep much money reserve in the bank, until a threat comes and then money and energy should all be spent on upgrading insurance and raising the village. Â Also the ""research"" part of the game was annoying to me because I could only focus on improving my research without multitasking to build homes and raise the village and/or upgrade insurance. Â I realized that if I click to upgrade the homes before clicking on the threat to ""research"", then my home(s) would upgrade in the background at the same time while I gained research points. Â It would be better if I could just do all these things at once and have them all open as pop-ups at the same time. Â Also, it seemed that if I could memorize all the different insurance rates and different prices of upgrading the homes, then I could be quicker to make a decision to click on and activate these decisions as soon as I saw I had enough money in the bank. Â But the funny thing to me is that in my real life, I would not be so concerned about ""building up"" (unless it meant it was providing better safety). Â I'll assume ""building up"" in the game means that the buildings are becoming stronger and more durable to withstand disaster, and that it's not something aesthetic or more spacious. Â Also in my real life, I would want to keep bigger reserve in my bank and be concerned to hold the best insurance policy at all times as earthquakes have no warning. Â I wouldn't try to be constantly spending all the money in the reserve, which seems to be what a strategy of winning the game is."180.151.209.39,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.

I would suggest to do a thorough research about the cause of the risk and elements involved and have a thorough cost-benefit analysis. The society as a whole should come up and take the responsibility to look after risk management. Take the example of Chile, because of the awareness and the governments people their risk was minimized to some extend though the intensity of earthquake was very high, managing risk is not the responsibility of only the government but the public too are equally involved and they should also take measures for the same."24.171.222.185,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to balanceÂ  between preparing for the shocks (comets) while at the same time expanding the community by using research, protection and insurance.Â  The choices I made and the trade-offs I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance were intriguing. Â First in Knowledge I learned to research every single comet passing through by analyzing its severity and chances of hitting my community.Â  The more I researched the comet the more I was prepared with how severe the comet was and how to prepare my community by letting them know and preparing by insuring and protecting their pods. Second, Protection-wise the higher the severity of the comet hitting the more the protection. I would save my resources for a more severe comet hitting the community because by understanding the possible shocks (comets) and by reducing the chances of the severe losses from the comets (shocks) and taking advantage of researching the comets when I knew the severity and chances to hit us were low and increasing money to expand my community, plus community network increased protection. Third, Insurance was increased when I believed the shock would be severe and protection would match the severity of the comet to save on insurance. If I had to repair the pods at least the amount to invest in the pods would not affect us as much and at the same time invest the money to upgrade the pods.Preparation for risk affect development was done immediately to avoid any surprises and loss of money in the beginning while preparing to research each comet to avoid higher risks.Â I played the game more than once, what I did differently after the first time playing the game was building more pods to increase my community, researching every moment I could and matching the protection to the severity of the each shock.

Risk management was used to help direct the limited resources we had in a way that would allow us to ""develop"" fast enough during each stage.  We had to choose between putting our time towards raising the level of ""protection"", researching the asteroids which had the potential to damage our community or the short time required to click on a property and upgrade (which took a while when you had built on all plots).  Another limited resource available was money, which could be directed towards either insurance, investing in the community to allow faster development or in increasing our protection to be more resilient to asteroid impacts. In order to meet the development needs of the stage, you were forced to either develop new plots of land or to upgrade previously developed plots to allow for an increase in production to the level necessary for the stage. Often I found I did not take enough risk and was not able to meet the output level for the stage, so net time I played I would increase my risk appetite during each successive play of the game.  Also I found that once I had raised the land to a suitable level to cover most asteroids, it freed me up to focus on ensuring that the level of production output was sufficient to pass the level (making sure the output was always in the green).2. I played the game more than I care to admit and I learnt some interesting thing which helped me get to level 6.  Firstly, reading the instructions helped me progress further, which an important part of risk engagement as I jumped straight into playing and didn't realise you could strengthen the communities in that time after an asteroid hit and reduce the chance of damage.  Secondly, using the trackpad on my laptop allowed me to connect my community faster than using the mouse.  During the first stages I would spend money on insurance as soon as I could afford it, however in later games I would wait until I was sure that there was a comet about to land that I did not have enough protection for and usually bought it at the last second if I thought I would need it based on the research I had undertaken.3. There are two changes I would undertake to make game more realistic towards where I live, firstly I would change it so different plots of land cost more but were more likely to flood than other plots and also different plots would have a higher potential for reward by having a higher production level.  Secondly, one of the biggest risk management choices I have had is deciding where to work and if it is worth leaving a company/country to work in other locations.  It would be a good addition to have the choice of selling the current community and relocating to a new part of the planet to start all over, much like a video game I loved in my youth called ""Theme Park"". "190.247.193.200,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management was to create the greatest balance betweenrisk and opportunities to achieve development.

Rather, it is achieved by the amalgamation of knowledge, protectionand insurance, keeping in mind the ability to cope with the result of theshock.At the beginning, because of somecash-crunch I wasnâ€™t able to focus on the protection part of the game. Thislead to a high initial damage but I was able to cope with this effectively. Withenough cash reserves, I immediately raised the land to protect from futurerisks.An aspect of risk knowledge whichI found to be very intriguing was that there were some falling comets for whichthe risk of hitting was very low. The knowledge about this was crucial infocussing on other comets and in some cases on strengthening my existing systemto withstand future shocks.The preparation initially was onthe weaker side. This adversely affected the way the community development wastaking place. As the preparation to face the risk increased, the damage causedby comets decreased substantially and this in turn hastened the development.2.Â Â Â Â Â Â I played the game several times. At first, I wasfocussing on just one aspect of the game â€“ Development. Soon I realized thatevery time a comet hits, I was losing out on all the previous good work and waseventually not clearing the levels. I, then, allotted equal weightage toprotection and insurance and combining that with the knowledge that I had ofthe impending danger, I was able to cope with the damage more effectively.The learning from the lectureshad practical usage in the game. Firstly, reducing risk through enhancingresilience requires an integrated planning process to make sure that structuresare resilient to current and future hazards. Secondly, apply post-catastropherebuilding processes to increase recovery speed and lessen follow-on effects.Third, comprehensive data is crucial throughout the natural disaster timelinefor increasing awareness, finding effective resilience measures, early warning systems,efficient disaster response and resilient rebuilding.3.Â Â Â Â Â Â If I were to develop a new version of the gamethen I would like to include an aspect where there would be incentives forbetter management of the risk. For e.g. I would like to give the player a bonusfor successfully being able to incur â€˜no damageâ€™ after a comet has hit theplanet. This could be in the form of bonus money or better protectionincentives or the ability to research on the comets more quickly. The reasonfor this is that the incentive for better development and in turn moreprosperity could potentially motivate people to do better risk management inthe face of impending danger.I live in the coastal region ofIndia. I believe a better way to track impending natural disasters would be a welcomechange. A case in point would be the tsunami that struck the nation in 2001. Alot of lives could have been saved had there been an early warning system.Another aspect relates to the governance. The behaviour and cognitive biasesthat politicians here tend to cultivate are impairing the way risk is managed. Excessiveexploitation of common natural resources such as oceans, forests etc., isleading to environmental degradation and a future drop in economic growth.Dissemination of knowledge on these aspects will help a long way in better riskmanagement and pursuing productive growth opportunities."75.74.218.134,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Recently I had to play a game calledRisk Horizon . It was a fun game that prompted the player to realize howimportant risk management is. This game is based on the preparation and what todo before and Â after the comet hits theplayerâ€™s Â pods (dwellings) Â that he/she builds. Â This game was designed to prepare the player forthe unexpected, because it is not if it comes, it is the inevitable when itcomes, how hard it hits, how severe the damages are after the hit. Also what todo after the fact The good part is that there is a wayto prepare through research and a way to protect through insurance ahead oftime. Also; the ability to absorbâ€ù the cometÂ hitâ€ù, overcome the damages to the pods, then continue to build. Be ableto bounce back quickly and continue.Â In this game like every game thereare choices, trade-offs you have to make while playing, thus Â there are consequences as well. In fact there isa physical aspect that had trade offs if building when a comets hits, it limit theplayer to either build additional new pod or repair the existing . Theintellectual aspect ( decisions, knowledge/ research  protection/insurance)that also required tradeoffs before the comet hit the player had to decide whento research prepare for future hits , and how to protect the pod community asthe comet was about to hit. If I only Â played the game only once, Â or Â hadto play several times again, what I would do differently would be Â to refer back to the instructions , perhapsthe tutorial . This along with the previous my experience ( â€œIf anyâ€ù) should helpme be more be resourceful with the gamesâ€™ tools. As you see it s focal point isknowledge through research, thus allows to see and prepare better. When youknow more your are able to see clearer , plus experience allows to Â perform confidently . If you know how toprotect yourself from the comet hits and Â the player knows what to do after the hit moreefficiently thus he/she plays better. I learned many things from the game.I realized how important it is to research, to understand, to gain knowledge Â in order to prepare, because we never know howhardÂ  â€œthe hitâ€ù it will be and when â€œthehitâ€ù is coming. With the right knowledge and ability to think it through, youcan plan and prepare better for that hitâ€ù. In most likelihood it will minimizethe damage, allow me Â to cope with iteasier and continue to move forward in a positive direct. To mitigate loss ifany.Â This game captures several aspectsof risk management. If I had the task of developing a new version of this game,I would implement a way or tool which allows the player to have the ability tomulti task and to access others to helping handsâ€_. â€œStrength in numbers.â€ùÂ This change I propose would betterrepresent risk management choices in Miami Florida where I live. A close nit communityis key , along with Â quick access toadditional tools that would allow the player to multi- task, do more at once.. Â For example; thisâ€ù additional Â hands toolâ€ù would Â be able to, research and get insurance/ protection( Shield) while building or repairing at the same time. This tool would alsoallow to( similar to Adobe Photoshop Â hand) Â be able to move the scope of the screen aroundbetter , and be able to see more thus able to prepare better at a shoter notice.Â Â Â "115.248.181.157,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game was a pure Risk management game. The game teaches how a risk is managed in Â time of problem,uncertainty. As the future is uncertain so risk is unavoidable.

The main things to manage in the game were :1) Wealth,2) Insurance,3) Development meter,4) Timing,5) Up gradation,6) Risk evaluation ( Severity of the meteors , Probability of hitting by the meteors)7) Research, andÂ 8) Community connections.A good choice of all these factors help in protection and thus help in development of an economy.Â I played the game multiple times and improved over each and every chance. Some of the learnings are:1) Insurance play the most important role. InsuranceÂ plays an important role in planning, leading, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the activities of Community both before a loss occurs ( pre-loss actions) and after a loss occurs (post loss) in an effort to minimize the adverse effects on Community at a reasonable cost.2) Wealth is to be used judicially.3) Research always pays.4) A switch in time saves nine.5) Connections among community are very important.The improvement in the game in the form of things which, I see, can reduce the probability of risk or can help in reducing it and help in coping risk in a better way are :1) More of wealth. Even if seen in a real world, wealthy economies can tackle risk in a better way because of the larger amount of resources available.2) Cheap insurance.3) Easy up gradation."41.75.84.90,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk management meant everything in the game! and I must say I really had fun playing Risk Horizon and I am sure I will be playing more of it as well as introducing my friends and colleagues to it, it'll sure be a 'soft way' to get them to learn about risk management. Firstly, you had to develop your community to the best of your abilities which is a necessary concept in risk management as you have to properly build the foundation. ThisÂ is same as the positive risk we take in sending our lovely kids to great schools andÂ providing them with sound education. After this, a person playing the game has to ensure thatÂ he or sheÂ optimizes the level to whichÂ they want to developÂ their community, will you be developing the entire community? or just as much as is necessary to realize optimal gains?. This is aÂ very important risk management concept that the game teaches because of the cost limitations suffered by individuals, households and small communities. The game teaches us that we can't buy 100% insurance or the highest level of protection all the time especially when you are just starting out but you can build on what you haveÂ in a step-wise mannerÂ this could be achieved by collaboration between individuals, communities, government interventionÂ etc. AnotherÂ important risk management concept the game teaches is the ability to recognize risk and also evaluate it to determine your risk response and requisite preparedness. In the game, the risks level was depicted by the comets severity,Â its chance of occurring and the protection level required to cope after it crashes. The player uses this info to ''ramp up'' and decideÂ how muchÂ protection or insurance is required to save him and his household from the comet's negative effects.I played the game so many times! and I learnt at least one new thing every time I started a new game. At first, it was hard to get past stage 1!Â I then decided to Â dedicate more time to understand the concepts and acquire the ''knowledge'' necessary to best defend my community. As soon as I understood what I had to doÂ to survive I started toÂ reach stage 3 and 4 nearly effortlessly. The game taught me toÂ understand the risk, analyzeÂ the risks for possibleÂ waysÂ to prevent it from occurring or at least reduce the impact if it did occur.If I was tasked with developing a new version of the game, it would be nice to include some real-life occurrences like introducing a hospital that charges aÂ  high fee for treating victims of the community who were totally unprepared for the comets and so are badly affected by its destructive effects as against community members who took the necessary precautions to avoid the risk and therefore do not require to pay this fee, But I must add that the developers of the game must have really put a lot of good thinking into the games development as it is a very fascinating, as well as an educative game that teaches the core concepts of risk management.I have to go now, back to risk horizon! more learning ahead............I wish you all the best throughout this course and also in your personal life and your career.Â "151.229.170.4,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,30.0 to 33.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,3.0 to 11.0,"The three preparatory elements of risk management were evident throughout the game in the shape of research/knowledge; insurance; and protection. The constant evaluation of the severity and likelihood of a given threat becoming realised, and preparing for it, is at the core of what risk management is about for me and I assume that is the point of the game.I played the game several times and experimented with a range of different emphasis in strategy. Common for all attempts was a constant re-investment in upgrades of the pods in order to increase the resources available for more upgrades of both pods and preparations. In terms of my protection strategies I tried emphasis on research in order to increase community connections; I emphasised insurance to see to what extent a sustain-and-rebuild strategy would fare (not very well); and finally I also emphasised protection to better sustain impacts.Placing the emphasis on one element of the three was not a viable strategy. I found that an emphasis on knowledge would nevertheless mean I sustained heavy damage from major events also with good community connections. A focus on insurance meant insurmountable impact on the development scale and costly rebuilding. Finally, a focus on protection also reduced the development levels, even appearing (imagined or not) to slow the revenue stream down (I assume this is part of the cost referred to in the instructions).The strategy I found took me the furthest (just short of completing level 6) was an emphasis on both knowledge and on protection. I would re-invest generated revenue in protection, especially after the level bar was full, and I constantly kept research bars high relative to the severity of the threat of any given comet. I only invested in insurance where I judged the severity and likelihood of a major event surpassing my protection were sufficiently high.If I got to add one element it would be fluctuating insurance costs which I did not get the impression are in play. If, like me, the player chooses to take out the insurance only after finding that one of the comets is a high likelihood/high impact event, then the cost for the insurance would go up substantially. I have yet to encounter an insurer who would not raise premiums if an event had become more likely. Thus, insurance is something you take out before an event is imminent or suffer increased costs and this should be reflected also in the game."211.253.149.10,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"1.Â Without risk management (such as insurance or protection) it is almost impossible to clear the stages.There are four components of risk management according to WDR14.Â The relations are as follows:-Knowledge: Understanding the rules of the game. I didn't try the tutorial at first so I did nothing on Â protection and totally got destroyed by a big comet of magnitude 7. After doing the tutorial I understood how to use protection figure.-Insurance: The insurance was quite straightforward, did not had trouble understanding it. As level increased, however, the cost for insurance went higher so after some failure I had to save for the insurance before I pass a level.-Protection: Protection cost not much at lower level, but as level increases the cost was going too high (and too slow to act upon comets) so eventually I saved only 4~5 spaces and just coped with broken pods.-Coping: Even if I did insurance and protection, there were events that pods could not escape from crisis. After the hit I faced broken pods and had to repair them. I could reduce the cost of repairing due to insurance.Â 2. I tried the game several times and finally made through level5.First attempt, did not knew how to use protection and without it I could not pass level3 because of the destructive comets.Second attempt, put a lot of resources into protection and insurance, but protection cost was too high to manage and could not pass the money limit.Third attempt, just before passing a level, I saved certain amount of money for insurance so when I got into a new stage I could buy insurance(of highest guarantee) right away.And I kept repairing pods whenever they got injured, because it seemed so slow with even one broken pod.Overall I learned it is impossible to manage risk without having all the components of risk management(knowledge, insurance, protection, coping).3. I would suggest linking action should be included in the ""peace times"" also. At first glance it looks like the community takes action only when risk hit society, but actually it's not. There is always social relationship going on with or without crisis(=comet hits). Therefore, as user develop the pods, he/she will also have to make a social link among the pods, building a social relationship even in normal times.Â Also, help from social part is also done after the crisis, so there should be another linking action after the comet hit. (More social link = Faster recovery)The place I live has a lousy system for risk management on weather, maybe it's because that we do not experience big crisis often. There is mediocre-level of insurance and hardly no protection, so whenever a risk hits hard, the damage is almost always massive.Â When crisis occurs, local community (government  private section) gathers up quickly and does everything they can do to reconstruct society. It is only possible because there are social actions taken at non-risky times. People feel ""included"" in the community and helping the injured member seems like a ""right"" thing to do. Without this, the coping process would be much longer and harder."90.210.122.230,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was3 fold: 1) to allow the community to learn about, and so prepare for,approaching risks through research and so minimise the impact of risk; 2)protection against risks through raising the ground on which the community is builtto lessen the impact of the calamity as well as making community connectionsthat create a safety net immediately after a calamity; 3) purchasing insuranceso that the calamity does not result in significant set backs in communitydevelopment.

Insurance is also a crucial component of risk management because in case of future calamity the losses can be covered and substantially minimized by using this great tool of insurance in risk management.The game was in itself was a case study of risk management. The game used protection for the pods by lifting the pods. The insurance was available to mitigate the losses in case of a damage by meteors. The knowledge about the damage from meteors by using research for meteors was very helpful to gauge the severity and probability of the risk of meteor attack.By protecting the pods to the level of severity of the meteor helped in achieving protection or no damage to the pods even though it is hit by a meteor. By researching about the meteor and gaining knowledge about it helped in understanding more accurately the severity and probability of a meteor attack. By insuring the pods for 50% or 75% insurance helped in mitigating the losses in case the pods were damaged by the meteor. The insurance helped in faster recovery and used significantly lesser amount to cope up the damage scenario.Thus preparation for risk by using optimized levels of protection and insurance helped in better , faster and cheaper recovery to the normal state and enhanced the coping ability of the pods.After playing the game for the first time, i learned only one component or approach to save the pods was not enough and was leading to the significant damage of the pods and recovery was not sufficient to proceed the level and win it. So, the next time on wards a balance and strategic optimization of the knowledge, protection and insurance components was crucial to reduce the probability of damage and recover faster and cost effectively in case of damage due to the attack.So a balance of knowledge, protection and insurance for cost effectiveness is vital for any risk management function or entity to act effectively.The protection and insurance components in the game are very realistic and follows the real life situations. But the knowledge part which comprises of the research of the meteors in not enough since it does not the conveys the risk properly so it is difficult to assess the risk and act. If the knowledge part is more elaborate and clarifies the risk properly it would be highly beneficial to mitigate the risk and act towards it more effectively. Hope these changes in the next release of the game better explains the concept of risk management more effectively."119.2.124.64,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The Game of Risk Horizon is allabout managing risk. Similar to the cost-time-quality triangle of projectmanagement, the risk management involves insurance, research, time andresource. Balance of all is required for successful completion of the project. Overstressing on one component has negative effect on others. If quality isstressed too much, it will cost more and time will not be favoring. The role ofrisk management is therefore to skillfully find a balance between thesecomponents so that the scarce resource is utilized to the optimum for thecompletion of the project in time. Too much engagement in protection may leadto depletion of resource without having time and resource left for research andconstruction. Whereas spending too much resource without giving due importanceto protection and research leads to exposure to comets thereby destroyingwhatever spent on the construction. Having insurance and research of adequatelevel was found to be helpful in protecting against destruction and in rebuildingthe damages. At times, when comets fall one after another rapidly, I found noother way but to invest heavily on the insurance as there is limited time forresearch.When the game was played for thefirst time, no thought could be given to the insurance. Although someimportance was given to the research and protection, progress of constructionwas hampered as attention was diverted to comets and protection. After playingthe game more than once, I got the feel of the need of balance of all theelements of risk management. For example, if a group of comets come almosttogether, there is no way that research on individual is possible. Hence, agood insurance was found to be effective. It was also found that a high levelof protection right from the beginning helps in saving the construction fromthe destruction. Nevertheless, a constant monitoring of the resource was foundto be important. As soon as there is enough resource gathered giving duethoughts to insurance and protection, it was found important to engage in theconstruction and upgrading the pods. The main thing I learnt from the game isto keep vigilant on all the components of risk management and learn to foreseethe risk and thereby make appropriate investment.The Risk Horizon Game does captureprinciples of risk management. However, it does not simulate real time risk wehave on earth. If I am to develop a new version of the game, I would developmore realistic natural and manmade calamities the world is facing today. Flood,earthquakes, GLOF or even global warming would simulate the real risksprevailing in this world. Many poor countries have limited or no resources atall to cope with such disasters. With limited resources, risk preparation is achallenge. The problem becomes more complex when substantial number of thepopulation lives below the poverty line thereby making the governments to maketough decisions.Â "80.28.230.77,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The Game helps you evaluate and think of the different mechanism for risk management and their balance in view of the limited information (research) on probability and severity of impact. The different options of researching more the comets (info), building pods (and later upgrading them, more expensive if flooded), protecting (elevating the island) and buying different levels/costs of insurance made you test and reflect of what option is better in view of the different comets coming down. The Game adequately, and harshly, reflected some the randomness of events and effects (misses, different levels of damage, etc.), the mix of instruments to manage and protect from the risk and further development.I played the game some seven times failing twice level 1 and the rest level 2, and although I did perceive the effects of the different mix of risk management options, was still frustrated (as in real life) of the randomness of effects (sometimes I thought I had over-protected in face of the expectedÂ  severity while other times I thought I had under-protected, and the effects were the opposite of what I expected- ie, no damage when I thought I was under-protected and lots of damage when I was protected AND insured. So finally I concluded that although there are instruments and measures, coping and resilience will continue to be a necessary ingredient in high risk areas..... sorry Chile, Japan, California (for natural disaster risks)... and Sub-Saharan Africa, Bolivia, Nicaragua, etc. for poverty and food security, etc., risk management can only go so far...The game introduces initially 4 elements of risk management and later a fifth by pooling/networking communities; a more sophisticated version would introduce the HUMAN factor of risk acceptance/culture in different Pods, i.e., some pods would have higher risk aversion others lower, and you can spend resources in training/awareness campaigns at each Pod, so as to elevate the risk awareness and propensity to protect and save at each community (instead of having all Pods cost the same at every level). As we know well from all the literature, culture and propensity to risk protection is higher in certain cultures and regions, while in others (with the same level of development) there is a greater tendency in having family and neighboring communities share the risk and coping measures (view the Cohesion funds of the EU vs the small cohesion funds in other developed regions , which rely more on their own resources and generally if there are pooled funds it's only for after-disaster reconstruction). Other game improvements/upgrades would introduce a systemic risk management method, ie, you could spend resources in establishing a ""system"" not only individual measures and the system would have levels, for example only the system design would have a small initial cost, later strict implementation (project management) system would have a higher cost; finally the same with Monitoring and evaluation (ME or Audit as in the ISO management systems) would cost even more, etc. This game could also be part of a ""set of games"" which also have other modules for project management of risk systems, for monitoring, evaluation and audit, and for financial calculations /modelling (simple ones of course).

The game Risk Horizon simulates some of the difficulties in balancing community development with preparing for potentialÂ  negative shocks through risk-management. In the process, it highlights the importance of finding a sustainable equilibrium ofrisk management measures in relation internal conditions of a community and the external environment it is confronted with. As such, it provided a good learning experience in addition to the course material. It exemplified some of the flaws of one-dimensional 'fixes', and increased my awareness of the (cost-benefit) trade-offs that are to be confronted in sustainable risk management. Additionally, it highlighted the importance of an aspect of risk management that I had not fully taken into account.When I started out thegame, I had the idea that the best manner to let this digital community flourish wasto cancel outthe threats stemming from the comets. Fully focussing on 'preparation' would allow me to limit the impact of shocks. In the long run, this would allow me to develop my community. Therefore, I enhanced knowledgeby researching all the comets, increased protection by raising the land, andinvested heavily to gain full insurance. However,this strategy of cancelling out risk rather than managing it turned out to be prohibitively costly and unsustainable. Continuously  implementing (inefficient) measures in order to avoid sequential shocks depleted my financial means, in turn, I failed to capitalize on opportunities to develop the community.Â  Subsequent attempts, I tried to find a sustainable and (cost-)efficient approach bymaking some trade-offs. I aimed to limit the cost of risk management measures by: taking the lowest insurance; focussing research on comets of whichthe chance of impact was high; and raising land to correspond with the threatlevels of comets whilst simultaneously taking in account a feedbackeffect (e.g. the land-lowering effect an impact in relation to the potential effect of subsequent comets).This enabled me to free up more money to invest in communityexpansion and development, which, in turn, allowed me to generate more financial means to implement risk management measures. Initially, this strategy seemed effective. However, in the end I only managed to get to level 3 as I had not fully managed to minimize the 'development setbacks' as a result of shock damages. Interestinglyenough, this pointed me towards the importance of the community linkages (in this case in relation to coping with the effects of a shock). Until then, I had not taken in account this in-game option that emphasises one of collective aspect of risk management. Taking it in account, I managed to reduce damages, which enabled me to further improve the community. This enabled me to reachlevel 4. (3.) If I would have to createa version of the game that is more related to the environment Ilive in (the Netherlands), I would focus on Flood Risk management.Â  TheNetherlands has a particularly long tradition of Â protecting its population and land area from continuingthreat of sea and rivers floods. This obviously means altering thetype of shock the digital community in the game is facing. Furthermore, I wouldalter (the operationalization of) some of the risk management components of preparation. To better reflect the national context, acquiring â€˜knowledgeâ€™ in the game could for instance focus on developing floodinformation, forecasting and warning systems, and new standards offlood defence. â€˜Protectionâ€™ could be operationalized in: managing waterways, water defences; and building houses thatare better equipped to withstand floods etc. In addition, I would suggest bringing in an element of 'uncertainty', in terms of the effect of global warming on the sea level. Â Â Â "82.171.96.234,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Dear Reader,I have played the game and found that the role of risk management in the game relied allot on early warning. In this case assessing the danger of each meteor. The trade-off I should have made was reducing the insurance level once the risk of meteors were no longer present. I found that in the game the progress seemed to stagnate when I did not do this. Also the protection factor in the game negatively impacted development. This happened almost immediately. The thing I would do differently if I played the game again is to correspond my insurance level to the knowledge I have at that time. Since I live in a country with allot of water related risks, I would pay extra attention the protection and maybe add some extra features in that area, next to raising the ground. If I had to reflect on this game and the things I learned it is the importance and interdependence of knowledge (pro-action), protection (Repression) and insurance. One might have knowledge of a crisis to occur but if there are no means, or there is no will to act then risk-management is useless.

The knowledge level onÂ the comets helped to make necessary arrangements and prepared to face the risk. I had played the game twice.

Initially Â my Â  choice Â was to Â focus on protecting Â the Â structures Â more than Â anything Â and spending heavily on insurance. Â  Â However after repeated efforts Â to Â finish a level, the Â fact that Â got Â highlighted was the importance Â of Â knowledge of the Â inevitable Â impending disaster. Seeing that Â disaster could not be avoided came the realization and clarity,that first most Â important Â thing is to understand the Â risk. , then Â how to reduce the effect of the risk and Â lastly Â handling Â the after Â effects The rate at which the Â damages Â were Â repaired Â directly affected to the availability of more resources.This is Â what Â one should look into.Just like Â in a simple Â case of Â spread of a disease.Faster Â the recovery rate, faster the people get back to work Â and lower the chances of the Â country Â suffering from Â economic crises due to Â lower productivity of the Â population The cost in terms of insurance and protection Â reduced Â tremendously the moment Â I understood the Â point behind the research of the Â comets. Â Playing this Â game over and over again was Â a learning experience Â and Â the biggest lesson being Â the trade off Â between protection Â against risk and preparedness. Â It is better to be Â prepared than Â be over protected, The opportunity Â cost Â lost is more Â when Â you are over protected Â than you are prepared. As one is more Â prepared, Â the impact of the disaster Â gets lesser.

This Â saving can be further Â put Â back into developing structures Â which are Â stronger. If i was to play Â the Â game again, Â I would Â pay more emphasis Â to Â first Â get knowledge on the Â impending Â disaster, research and then look into Â ways to mitigate the disaster.

I think that the message tried to give to audience from this game is relied on 3 tiers. First and the most fundamental one is being prepared everytime for an unexpected event. Because the pace of meteors were different from each other, thus if you didnt get prepared yourself to hit you could get damage. The other key message was related with the researching of each meteors. although at the beginning of the meteor appeared on the screen, their severeness was seemed little, however after making research about it its severeness increased when when it hitted, its damage was tremendous. By taking into consideration this point, i would say that making research is crucial unless you think that you are well prepared to unexpected risks. Last but not least point is after one meteors hit your land, your lands level decreases. It means that even you feel like you are well prepared for future risks, you should check your status after an unexpected event lived.

Â It was clear that funds spent onminimizing the risk i.e. insurance and raising the island had limited valuewhen you exposure was only small or another way of putting it is that you canspend more money and lose development potential trying to stop the shocks formaffecting you than the cost when you are hit by a asteroid. Â As you havegreater value of infrastructure and the shocks starting coming more frequentlyin the higher levels then spending time and money protection and insurancebecomes more important. Â By using the time when shocks were not frequentto raise the island and ensure enough cash was in the bank to buy insuranceensured that once all of the effort was required just to prevent damage (i.e.research) and repairing the damage that was there.2: Â After the first time i learnt that there was limited reward fromÂ insuringÂ when i had fewÂ assetsÂ and the risk of hit was low in the first coupleÂ ofÂ rounds.

Time was also a factor, as I had to spend some time doing research. The trade-off at the beginning was that i couldn't spend too much time creating pods, as I have to same some money to use it for insurance, and the level thing on the right that consumed a lot of money. Interestingly, as I was increasing levels, money wasn't an issue anymore (i guess this is an example of a developed country), and actually, i failed to pass to level 5, because i was over-protecting too much, when I should have use the money to upgrade the pods. I guess that my main outcome from this game is that at the beginning, when you were 'poor', it was way more difficult to balance my budget between creating pods and protecting from the meteorites, but as I was getting more money, it wasn't too difficult, and actually i was spending money on protection even if there were no meteorites on sight or the risk was quite low.Â I played the game twice, the second time, I didn't over-spend in protection, specially when i was getting close to level 2.

This would make the game more challenging when you have enough money to protect just from meteorites, at the end, i didn't even use my insurance and I was ignoring it for a little bit because I knew Â I was already protected for the meteorites, but if i know that something 'random' can happen (bad management, riots, flood, hurricanes...), i'll keep an extra eye on my insurance money"202.138.249.7,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"i will manage risk from comet effect, it is not running from the comet but create system how to play with great score, cover with insurance and have a good preparing if the comet come.Â we need strategy for preparing the comet come. we need support from out score to create strategy. we do action plan with cover insurance.

To make these choices, there was always the need totrade up the price of some items in order to get others. I always had to makesure I did not put all my money-resources just on knowledge-research, or justfor protection, nor just for purchasing insurance. I always tried to strike abalance for, just a little bit of protection can go a long way to save a lotwhen disaster strikes.Â  Even if your podsare damaged, the damage will be less if you are protected, as it could beeasily repaid, especially if you had insurance.Preparation for risk can affect developmentimmediately an imminent disaster strikes, as well as after after the disaster.An entire community can be lifted up and out of flood paths using the advancetechnology we have today. Some of these risk management could be done bypreparing in advance through the laying down of sandbags, building of dams toprotect homes from flooding or by putting houses on stilts. When shocks such asdrought, floods, famines or loss of job by a household strike, it might be toolate to protect or buy insurance, but you can still make community connections.The game was very nice and may be, because I studied thecourse material and went through the videos before playing, I did play the gamejust once.Â  If I were to play the gameone more time, I will first of all bear in mind that the resources I am workingwith are very limited.

Â Withthis in mind, I will make sure I put resources on research, while making surethere is enough protection, as well as affording better insurance that would beuse to pay for any damage on my pods (communities).Â I learned from thegame that, community protection is a type of insurance. When disaster strikes, wecan help each other survive by sharing resources, thus, forming and sustainingconnections is very valuable in risk management.

The important part was considering how muchmoney we have and then prioritizing what is important to do immediately andwhat can do later. This game also wanted to show us that for making right decisionand prioritizing we need to have enough information. However sometimes we donot have enough information and we have to think ahead and try to predictpossible risks and opportunities.I had to make a trade-offs when I was considering if Ishould do more development or if I should better to pay more attention to the protectionand the prevention of risks. I also had to take into account how much finance Ihave and what kind of insurance I can pay. Then I had to consider what optionis the best if to buy the most expensive insurance immediately or wait a bit untilI make more money so I can afford it. I had to think about my budget when Iwanted to buy an insurance and at the same time I had to pay attention to otherthings what were happening on my planet.

Knowledgehelped me in decision making. Insurance mitigated negative aftermath of shocksand destructive events, so I could survive crisis much better and with betterinsurance I had shorter recovery time â€“ this was an effect that I could seeafter some time. When I played the game second time, I was much more aware ofrisks and of what is the appropriate behavior for such a risks and situationsthat were on my planet. I think that is also important that a developer (riskmanager) has already some experience with a crisis, so he does not waste a timeand money. The main thing for me, when I played second time, was realizing thatI have a limited budget and I have to carefully consider how I will spend amoney. Another thing was realizing that investment in development makes money,so I can get more resources that way. The main thing I learnt was importance ofseeing the big picture of situation and paying attention on all details in thesame time. The game showed that risk management has more benefits than costs.If I could add one simple thing to the new version of thisgame I would upgrade a community function. I would add there some shelters andin case of emergency people would receive an alarm notice and evacuatethemselves. So more people would survive and be ready to collaborate oncommunity development.I live in the Czech Republic andÂ I think that my country needs to focus on risk management for finance threatsthat face households.

In the game Risk Horizon, risk management included increasing knowledge of comets that threatened the world, obtaining insurance against comets known to be threats, and protecting the planet by raising the level of the community above waves caused by comet strikes.As a player in the game, I made choices that affected whether my community succeeded, as tracked by the color meter display. Sometimes, I chose to focus on development. As my community grew, my success rate on the color meter increased. The choice to focus on development often hindered my ability to withstand shocks from the comet waves. Compared to real world examples of risk management obstacles, my focus on development choices was like a lack of information. I knew the comet risks existed, but if I wasnâ€™t paying attention to the threats, I would fail at properly managing the risk. Similarly, if I knew I could buy insurance and ignored it, my incentives may have been too strong to raise the color meter instead of protecting against shocks.One important lesson I learned was that I was avoiding risk. Admittedly, I played the game multiple times because I found it difficult to advance. In the MOOC, Iâ€™ve learned this is often the case in developing countries where shocks seem unavoidable or the cost of one shock impairs oneâ€™s ability to cope with other shocks. Like a farmer who selects safer crops when faced with a dry season, I stayed focused on the risk of a devastating comet strike. I didnâ€™t take enough risks at first to learn more about the comets or evaluate my own ability to respond with preparation or protection.As I repeated levels, I gained knowledge about each comet. I compared the comet severity to my own preparation and protection. If I could raise the community ground to avoid waves, I could turn my attention away from the potential shock to focus on increasing development and my own success. Similarly, when information revealed potential devastation or a high certainty of shock, I could purchase insurance and temporarily divert resources from growth.If tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would add information about how much each development level (undeveloped plot, single house, larger structure) added to the growth rate of the color meter for game success. In the MOOC, Iâ€™ve learned knowledge helps people prepare for risks. With more information about the economic output of different development levels, I could better evaluate how many resources should be placed to preparing or protecting against risk.

It shows that you have to make choices, indeed, and I found myself more focussing on the protection and not so much on the insurance and knowledge. It was interesting that on the higher levels however, also the insurance became necessary because there were more and more higher risks of getting hit. I was mostly assured by the effect that protection has: it is an investment that you do in the beginning with a long term effect that is relevant also for future risks. The knowledge is only relevant for that particular risk and therefore less efficient. The insuarnce again is long term although its coverage changes depending on the development of the locality.The first time I played, I did not know what the research did to the possibility of reducing the effect of a hit, so that helped the second time. I also improved on building faster because without that the level can not be concluded. It became quite easy to reach the higher levels once I found out what the best strategy was. I think it is a bit too simple. I would rather keep level one as it is but instead of increasing the number of comets in the higher level, I would prefer to increase the complexity, for example by forcing to make more choices based on the costs (there was not much limit in spending in the game that I played) and considering relocation or different types of protection. Another type of risk could also be interesting to have to deal with because often places have multiple issues and have different ways to protect against them. In the place I live, protection and preparation would be the main actions to migitate. Preparation in order to cope better is not part of the game, but would also  be relevant. Lastly, social, political, cultural factors are not taken into account. Altogether, I think the game gives a nice impression but it is too much simplified which makes it look too easy. It is like other computer games, I guess, that do not reflect the reality."197.211.216.186,0.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to maximise the gains of development while minimising the effects of the risks in play. With limited resources and time, opportunity costs had to be weighed against the dangers inherent in the game world. Being too cautious was soon discovered to be a risk in and of itself, as limited resources could not be replenished in time to repair the inevitable damage caused by the comets. Being too reckless however meant that in the time spent attempting extensive developments, the cost of ignoring the meteors exposed you to catastrophic losses without community connections and resources to pull together despite the lack of formal insurance.The game effectively reinforced the inevitability of disaster, and the necessity of having and honing a strategy and a plan to deal with it in advance. The possibility of a community to thrive and develop in the midst of great risks was surprising, and the choice to concentrate on only one form of risk reduction turned out to be a risk in and of itself. Utilising multiple risk management strategies was found to be the best and only way to effectively develop a flourishing community with risk resilience to weather future storms. A raised profile, cash in the bank and developed infrastructure was the best way to effectively ensure that in the future, insurance could be purchased as and when a large hit came, small hits could be survived without any further expenditure, and time spent raising the land in advance of a comet hit could them be better spent learning about its dangers and the probability of damage, in order to study the phenomenon and spend time creating effective community strategies and connections when the inevitable happened.After playing the game a few times, I began to realise the possibilities of alternatives to insurance, the obvious and immediate risk aversion mechanism with which I am familiar. Research and building community connections were found to make an appreciable difference to minimise the impact of and pinpoint meteor risks, and could be a real and tangible non-financial asset for support and repair in the event of large and inevitable disasters. I learned to question the ignorant assumption that research is optional or wasteful.Â I also found that implementing protective mechanisms by raising the land was time consuming but worthwhile up to a certain point, after which it impeded the ability to develop and build, and to research, as no functions could be engaged in simultaneously. I learned additionally to develop smaller buildings quickly and larger buildings conservatively based on the projected impact of meteors, to avoid loss of completed productive developments through mismanagement and ambition. Furthermore, I learned to keep some money in reserve for last minute insurance for high-level unavoidable risks arising for which I could not adequately prepare, and for future developments in the next levels. Most of all I grew to understand that to keep a small and conservative society completely safe would rob it of the opportunity to develop to the next stage, trapping it in a cycle of fear, misunderstanding the possibilities presented by known and managed risks.Â I would suggest the addition of three status bars to represent the three mechanisms of risk management. This would improve the game by teaching the player to balance the bars in order to achieve a green development bar result, and to remind them of their equal importance, and the opportunity costs presented by favouring mechanisms. Balance and proactivity is the key to success in this game and to managing the real challenges it presents."177.141.230.45,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,-63.0 to -36.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"The role of risk management in the game was very clear once I had to ponder between all available tools to achieve the goal, so it was necessary know which was the best tool for each situation, how much time or money spent researching, protecting or buying insurance, etc. Also, the preparation for risk was strictly connected to development because when the negative outcome was realized, the magnitude of loss - in terms of resources and time to recover - was given by your condition, what in turn was related with the actions you had done to prepare.I played the game about three times, and my biggest mistake in the first and second attempt was neglect the importance of research for preparation to the risk.

Risk management played an important role as township had to be protected against the comets and it was a difficult task to judge how much damage it will make . the risk of comet hitting was a crucial part because hitting the comet or missing of the comet would only decide the funds needed for further development, Insurance was taken as a priority against the other two because some times knowledge and protectionÂ  alone cannot help to recover from disaster .the preparation has to be immediate because the development is affected and to keep the pace of development one need to be immediately prepared . to maintain a trade off 50% insurance 20% knowledge and 30% protection would be a right option to manage a risk.Â 2) Playing the game second time focus would have been more on development pare and more over to that protection from the risk would be the priority because no doubt the development is affected when ever their is risk but one could save the funds and can utilize more funds for further development if one has insurance cover or any other protection.3) one extra thing which was missing in the game and i would like to add would be the causalities and no of deaths and the other thing would be making a particular missile which would give me an option to destroy 3 comets in the sky it self because due to technology we have choices to over come from the risk , but the thing is we have to make the write decision , and three chances for all the six rounds would have been appropriate to destroy a particular comet.In the place and one option of fund generation which was automatic in the game .

Reaching a certain level of development calledmilestones during a time limit means that the level has been beaten, with sixlevels in total, each increasing in difficulty. Meteors serve as a danger tothe settlement, with each one having the capacity to crash into the ocean,causing harm to the settlement. Each meteor has a meter for severity, chance ofhit, and research. A meteor may or may not hit, and may or may not cause harm. Methodsof damage control include research and elevation. By clicking an individualmeteor, it is â€œresearchedâ€ù as time progresses, and can only be research one ata time, demanding full attention. More research allows the player to connecteach pod in a random-lit order during a longer time limit after a meteorstrikes. The more connections made, the more damage is mitigated, with thepossibility of no damage. Elevation, like researching, will demand all of yourattention. But unlike researching, which is initiated with a small fee, elevationcosts money in short, regular intervals. The benefit of elevation is that itprovides protection from water damage for a series of meteors, while researchdoesnâ€™t. Research, however, provides a chance of no damage, while elevationwill simply moderate damage broadly. The last element of the game is insurancefor pod damages, which comes in three plans, and increase in cost each level.The tutorial provided me theknowledge to defend and expand my settlement. I learned that upgrading podsincreases the rate of development, and that research and elevation providedprotection to reduce the magnitude of harm from meteor waves, while insuranceprovided a great reduction in cost during time of need, when the civilizationwas crippled. During game play, my settlement was never in harm. However,because of my focus on protection and insurance, my settlement didnâ€™t grow intime, and so my first few attempts ended in failure.Â  I was forced to reassess my situation. RiskManagement in this game meant I had to balance protection with growth, and hadto take necessary risks for needed expansion. This meant reactive protection,which was cost effective, allowing me to allocate funds to growth and expansion.The reactive â€œsword and shieldâ€ù defense proved to be more successful, allowingme to reach level five my fourth and fifth attempt. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Consideringchanges comes as a challenge to me. Living in New England, the only risks thatcome to mind are minor civil disputes, financial instability and floods, thelatter which is well covered already. Perhaps give a choice of what kind ofbuilding the player wants to build, covering power plant, residential, R and Dcenter, education, and bank. At the end of each round, a report is given thatincludes either setback or growths in each sector, with a ranking report,ranging from one to twenty, representing the status of the settlement, fromimpoverished to stable and thriving development. Each choice in building andupgrade affects that field, and each field interacts with one another, buildingup the settlement and leading to consequences related to protection andexpansion. Poor maintenance of any of the fields can lead to danger for thesettlement as a whole. These additions make sense in my case because the riskswhere I live are pretty much as the changes I described. When one of theseareas are effected, the others react, leaving the population to deal with it,prepared or not.Â Great assignment, had fun.Â "74.79.69.218,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game risk horizon was an exercise in the tradeoffsinherent between speedy development and protection for the future as well asbetween spending time on research into potential risk and spending time on acquiringprotection to guard against it. The key components of risk management:Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping were guiding principles to achievesuccess in the game.Â  For instance,without knowledge of the severity of potential shocks (the comets) anappropriate level of protection could not be achieved and the decision toinvest in insurance and whether that was worthwhile could not be made.Â  The game highlighted the fundamental role ofknowledge, of research, as a guide to making important future decisions both inthe virtual reality of the game as well as in the real world.The inherent tradeoff between preparation for riskmitigation and actual development was a crucial aspect of the game as ithighlighted the problem governments in developing countries face: spendingvaluable resources on risk management at the expense of fasterdevelopment.Â  The point was well madeâ€”if onesacrifices protection for quicker development the impact of even one shock iscatastrophic.Â  However, if oneover-invests in protection then one isnâ€™t able to sustain a good level ofdevelopment.Â  Although the temptation toreach ten bars of protection is high, it must be guarded against. Playing the game repeatedly taught me the value of trying differentstrategies to win.Â  Eventually, I foundthe best strategy was an immediate investment into pods, no insurance, quickresearch on comets and then spending time and resources on raising theprotection level.Â  If, for instance, apotential comet was at 6 bars of severity and my protection level at 4, I wouldraise the protection level to 5 and spend time on research into the comet sothat building connections between communities could make up thedifference.Â  In this way, I suffered nodamage any time a comet struck and found it unnecessary to purchase insurancewhile also being able to invest sufficiently in development to beat the game.Â  A key difference I wish to highlight between the game andthe real world is the role of uncertainty.Â The game gives us a lot of knowledge about what level of damage wasabout to come and how quickly in the game; this is impossible in the realworld.Â  Research and good data areinvaluable in helping governments estimate potential risk; however, there maynot be sufficient time to prepare for them.Â I would attempt to magnify the role of uncertainty in a future iterationof the gameâ€”I would add two types of shocks and leave it unclear which wasabout to strike.Â  Thus there would haveto be an additional tradeoff between protection for one versus the other. Or Iwould have idiosyncratic speed of the comets rather than the constant fast orslow speeds they currently have so that it is unclear how much time there is toprepare."46.53.183.152,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Â I believe that the game was able to clearly prove that if you want to preventcommunity from some potential shocks and to mitigate negative impact of risks (ifthey occur), you cannot achieve that goal without effective and responsible riskmanagement.Playing the game I fully realized that my attention (as the Luminator ofAlora) was supposed to be paid to all powers I possessed â€“ Research, Protectionand Insurance. I also learned from the game that all these three powers shouldbe treated with equal seriousness. They are interdependent parts of someintegral well-balanced structure â€“ a kind of triangle whose very existence andshape directly depend on its sides. Thanks to Research, I managed to decreasethe severity and even the hit probability of some comets. Allocating resources toProtection, I could secure my community from comets that had reached the surfaceclose to the shore, as well as boost its resistance to potential ones. Due toInsurance, my community was able to recover quite easily after hits of someextremely severe comets without any serious financial losses, and I could also investsaved money into further community development.If we speak about preparation for risk, I think that Knowledge comesfirst. When you know what kind of risks your community is more likely to faceand what consequences these potential risks can cause, you can adequately selectand undertake all required measures and activities to address risk properly. Thatâ€™swhy in the game I quite frequently made my choice in favor of Research.I played game several times. When I played for the first time, I startedit simply with building numerous pods and boosting Protection level, and Ifailed. Then I changed my policy and started a new game with building of onlytwo pods, allocating more resources and time to Protection and Research. Iabstained from further construction of new pods and focused on upgradingexisting ones. And it worked â€“ pursuing that plan I could quite rapidlyincrease the rate of development and fill the development bar. Then, every nextnew pod I tried to upgrade at once. As for possible changes to the game, I would like to propose an optionallowing taking different actions (can be limited to two) simultaneously as ithappens in real life. For example, when you are involved in Research activitiesyou can at the same time take efforts to boost Protection level. Or, at least,provide access to such kind of option under certain conditions (e.g. extrapayment, building freeze, etc.).Â "198.169.239.3,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to determine the risk of how much damage the asteroid would do in compared to the amount of money you had, the level of pod, and the insurance you bought. The choices I made was to try and increase the level of pod I had while maintaining at least 33% of the insurance and trying to research as much as I could about the asteroid. Â If an asteroid did do damage, I was always most concerned about fixing up the pods immediately in order to create less damage the next time. Â I thought this was important because having more and more damage was too high of a risk for me. Â If I were to play the game again, I would definitely do more research on each of the asteroids that came through. Â Some were hard as they were moving to fast but I thought it would be more beneficial to have as much information as possible. Â I learnt that it was a balance between how much insurance to have - I typically started out with only 33% insurance - and how much damage was actually done. Â I found that the more research I was able to do, the better as I was able to build more connections which allowed less damage to occur. Only towards the end of the game I felt more insurance was necessary as research and community building was very hard to do. Â I don't think I would change anything in the game. I felt that it captured risk management very well and how it is always changing. Â This came in the variances of speed of the asteroids and how it allowed for a lot or very little research. Â I think that the game represented risk management very well. Â The only criticism I had of the game was how fast the money kept coming in. I felt that by the end of the game, I would have been able to have the fullest protection again the asteroids without any problems, therefore created almost no risk. Â Overall, I think the game portrayed how risk management is always changing and how hard it is to determine the outcome of a disaster, especially when it appears as if it is going to miss and then ends up hitting and causing more damage than expected.

Surprisingly noneof my tradeoffs included knowledge or insurance; rather, I used all myresources on raising my village to a very high defensive level andbuilding/upgrading the pods to increase my production. In the first level Iallocated a vast amount of resources to elevating my village to protect it fromthe surges caused by the comets. This strategy cost me a lot of resources upfrontand slowed my pod upgrading.Â  However,theÂ  focus on raising my city meant that Ialways had a high baseline level of protection and it was quick and easy to re-raisemy village after comet strikes.Â Furthermore, it saved me money on insurance and knowledge as these twoaspects where less important given the level of protection resulting from my earlyinvestment in my villages defenses.Â  Thisthen allowed me to focus the majority of my resources on upgrading my pods thusincreasing my production which in turn made completing the levels relativelysimple as I would often finish with thirty to forty seconds to spare.Â I only played the game once because on my first tryI managed to get to level 6 and almost beat it.Â That said if I could do something different I would have bought a smallamount of insurance as when my villages defenses were eventually overrun itwould have been very nice to have cheaper repairs. Furthermore, I would haveallocated more resources to pod upgrades rather than raising my village earlyon in the game because in the later game more money is produced and thus thereis more money to allocate to defense without hurting production. The main thing I learned from the game was how toallocate scarce resources and how to balance protection and production. If youinvest to too much of one aspect than you will not pass the level. However, at thesame time if you do not invest enough in an aspect you will fail the level. Thisis essentially the dilemma of all people working in risk analysis as they must operatein an environment of finite resources.There are a few things I would change about thegame. First I would link the cost of insurance to the number of pods ratherthan the level one is at. Â Second, Iwould allow the player to invest in a missile defense system that could shootdown the comets; however, this would be very expensive and could only be used afew times a turn. Last, I would lessen the amount of protection provided by raisingones city as it allows the player to avoid both insurance and research and thusnarrows their focus.

Of course the consciousness and awareness of thepossible attack also helped in the preparation for it and also protecting thepods from being attacked.HOW PREPARATION AFFECTS DEVELOPMENTPreparation for the riskprevented the country (pods) from being wiped out.

Preparation and research is always important because it's not something to be done when the crisis is upon us.It is important to have a good grasp and a balance between everything - we can't expect to ""wall ourselves up"" and think that we are ready for everything, nor we can afford to just invest everything into our economy, thinking that we can just throw money at any problem that may arise in the future.I've also learned that action before hand and action after a crisis strikes are both very important.I live in a country where one of the main banks kinda defaulted (well, it was kinda robbed by the director board lol) so in terms how I would have changed the game - I would have added internal economic threats and change the theme of the game to be more understandable (let's say it's a village/city on the beach, the pods can be quarters in the village and then city and instead of comets - different kinds of waves). So it would basically be like population happiness meter which will give bonus to the progress bar and money generation. It will depend on how well the player is prepared - a crisis strikes but no damage, people are happy, below 30% no change, over 30% damage and people are restless - can we fix everything up in 30 seconds? if so it's a boost the happiness meter.The bonuses wouldn't be huge, but they will be a good addition - should the game require a new feature."86.8.154.36,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role ofrisk management in the game was to teach when and how to protect and prevent theadverse impact of risk as well as knowledge about the risks present in the game.It was to invest and increase development with the effect of minimal riskinvolved and how to control the risks and its effects. Knowledge ofrisk towards the pods increased understanding the impact of comets falling ontothe pods. Â Information on comets weregiven with respect to the severity of the damage the comet brings to the pod,chances of the comet hitting the pod and amount research that has been takenwith respect to that specific comet. Protection was gained from building networkwith the community and insurance helped reduce the cost of the impact of the comets.Insurance helped spread the cost, however as there were three options on thetypes of insurance this was a challenge because measuring the amount of risk thepods were to face was difficult and near to impossible.When therewas a comet which had an adverse impact on the pods, it was wise to take uphigh insurance which covered 75% of lost. It was effective to build thecommunity when faced with comets with low severity and chances of hitting thepod. It is very important to have liquid assets to cover the cost of lost. Preparationof risk affected development after some time.

Some levelof protection was essential from the beginning but knowledge was key toinvesting time and money wisely on protection and/or insurance. Insurance wasbeneficial however I delayed purchasing it, instead diverting funds to protectingthe colony. Once a satisfactory level of protection was reached, I devoted timeto research - particularly when the risk was large.Initially I constructedlots of pods and then once a comet was on the horizon, I researched it andacted accordingly. I didnâ€™t succeed in getting beyond level 3. The next time Iplayed I built less pods and protected them with the money that was being made,I then upgraded one or two in the name of making more money quicker so I couldreinvest that money on more protection, insurance and upgrades - a kind ofâ€˜trickle downâ€™ approach. Using this method and investing time in research whilethe pods were being developed meant I completed the game. I learned that alarger, less developed colony with little protection or insurance issusceptible to loss from risk. A colony with resources spent on protection fromand insuring against risk proportionate to its size, can avoid losses fromrisk. Knowledge, protection and insurance are all necessary for prosperousdevelopment.The risk in the game wasexternal to the colony and comets missed more often than they hit. Inhabitants didnâ€™tbecome overconfident, thinking the risk was minimal or some other colonyâ€™sproblem. They didnâ€™t question where the money was being spent or voice concernsthat it should be spent elsewhere with potentially immediate benefits for theme.g. a new school, hospital or infrastructure. I would add an element withinthe community that could be opposed to money or time spent on insurance,protection or research. The game would then need to incorporate education as afactor to channel money towards in order to inform the community of the risk andreduce opposition to spending on protection or insurance. Money spent on thesethings when the community was opposed to it would increase civil unrest andreduce the rate of development."171.99.186.234,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game provided me with a chance to glimpse what risk management is. In the game, I had to prioritize the risks by research based on the severity and probability as some of the risks are happening simultaneously. I also had toÂ allocate limited resources to the development target while providingÂ appropriate protections. I haven't paid attention to the research until I lost a couple of games. After then, based on severity andprobabilityÂ of risk, I could decide which risk to focus on when risks are coming simultaneously. When severity was low or became low by research, I couldÂ even take them and focus on other risks and other development of priority. I have also tried a couple of games to maximize protections butÂ such protective actions could not be achieved due to the limited resources. Best protection must be best. However, in the real world, consideration should be paid to the available resources which made me understand that protection is something to be balanced. In this sense, insurance was felt like a financial burden at first as I was more focusing on the development and the return of resources rather than damage.Â From this, insurance was regarded something like redundancy which can be engaged in the later stage when I become to think I can financially afford to redundancy.Â As the game is played in the limited time frame, it seems the players are more focused on the preparation for and protection of risks and pay less attention to the recovery from damages. It seems to be that effect of insurance is less stressed in the game as I think the players cannot sense the comparative effects of insurance and amount of insurance coverage. Risk is something we cannot be free from and adversely affect what have been developed and achieved by way of damage, loss and/or delay. Preparation of risks reduce and prevent such adverse effects of risks. First thing to do is to understand the risk itself just, as it was in the game, severity (adverse impact) and probability. Understanding of risk is the starting point of the preparation of risk. Preparation includes hedging of risk, minimizing of impact and recovery from the impact. Risk management is something to well balance all of these activities. I am not a good game player. The game was so discouraging as I could not even pass the second stage despite multiple tries. I became to think, in the real world the risk management is nothing easier than a game. ""Discouraging enough!""

Thevariables in the game related to these three aspects are the research, theelevation of the land as well as purchasing insurance respectively constrainedby currency as a resource. As building construction was the only simultaneousrunning aspect, the three aspects were all trade-off of each others with moneyas a constraint. However, with information regarding the comet as well asinsurance / protection being semi-permanent, the trade-offs was clear. Â Â Â Â Â  With insurance being provided by a thirdparty, it was clear that protection could be gained immediately and the risksare hedged. However, the timing of when to buy insurance and what type tooptimize the payout greatly affects the economy. This preparation of the riskimplied a real world problem of not having duely warning regarding shocks suchas black swan and creates a sense of waste in investing in insurance (if overprotection was used and the payout was not worth the insurance). Â Â Â Â Â Â  The implication of these trade-off taughtme the optimization of resources and unlike other real time strategy games,sometimes there are not enough time / resources to optimize it all on the go. Thiswas apparent on my first run-through of the game after skimming theinstructions. Although I understood the framework of having knowledge beforeinsurance and protection, I hastily built protection of elevation and wastedsome of the resources I couldâ€™ve used at a later stage with the knowledge fromthe comets. This implies the paramount importance of knowledge of the shock(comet) before wasting resources (money) on protection (elevation of land).This knowledge helped the second run-through all the entropic nature of thegame damaged my score with heavy comets.Â Â Â Â Â  One element I would improve on is themini-game in regards to preventing damages.

If the city was constantly hit bywaves it became impossible to invest on the city itself, resources would beneeded to repair the damage and it would waste time that could be spent ongrowth, research and so on. My main issues were knowledge and protection.Instead of building lots of construction I preferred to focus on three or soearly on to have a better flow of resources and be able to spend more onprotection. I didnâ€™t really used insurance that much, in fact I kind ofneglected it. It seemed much more useful to spend time and resources onprotection and research and actually prevent the damage, rather than dealingwith it. 2) On my first try I still wasnâ€™tsure of what to do and what effects my actions had in the game. The next time Itried to develop fast and focused only on protection, and didnâ€™t get goodresults. I had better results balancing protection and research on the next tryand could get to higher stages. If I could play more, I think I would try toexplore more the utility of insurance. I couldnâ€™t quite grasp it in my plays. Ithink that the most important thing I learned from the game was the relation betweenrisk management and progress. Itâ€™s a hard thing to balance, on one handspending time and resources on risk management can slow down your progress, onthe other hand without a good risk management everything you built could belost in the worst case. 3) Brazil suffers a lot from socialinequality.

In case of great damage the citizens would be able tostart the repairs by themselves but would need funds from the player to finishit, saving some time for the player, especially if a meteor strikes with fullforce too close to the deadline.

The construction of pods takes place on the planet and simulates the expansion of living areas in the world as well as the increase in world population by the development of pods. The development of pod through levels changes them from primitive ones to more complex, reflecting urbanization. The risk posed to the progress bar filling up through building and progression comes in the form of comets and meteors flying at different speeds and having different values for severity and chance of contact. All Risk management is reflected in Risk Horizon through the three options of security through buying insurance on the damage caused by the comets, preparing for the risk before knowing it will happen by raising the platform, and coping with risk by conducting research on the comets as they are falling to improve the chances of having no damage. Preparation for risk using any of the three methods had the opportunity cost of not being able to spend the money used on protection for development or new construction, and even though research was free, while the research window was open no other game actions could be completed and therefore development was slowed in the short term by managing risk. In the long term development of the pods, risk management made growth possible since the effects of comet hits would be minimal and more money would be available continually.Â 	I played the game twice, and changed by gameplay drastically from the first time to the second. The first time I played Risk Horizon, I noticed that when I was raising the platform or if I purchased investments, my bar would turn red so I immediately avoided those investments and put all my funds into the construction and development of new pods. My only risk management was research of the comets, which was effective for the first two levels, but when the number of comets increased I could not cope with all of them and they ended up damaging my pods so much that I ran out of time and funds to reach the development requirement. In my second turn, I put all my money immediately into the maximum insurance as well as raising the platform as high as possible. While in the first two levels I barely reached the development requirement in time, I reached level five since I easily dealt with the increasing number of comets.	If I could add a concept to this game I would make it possible to focus research on more than one comet since in real life risk management must cover multiple risks coming at you at the same time much like the comets. If we only focus on one problem, we ignore the other ones. We must remain vigilant of all the risks in life that can affect us and be able to distribute out efforts in coping with multiple problems and prioritizing our efforts for maximal protection.Â 	"41.216.170.14,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"1.

Development is Â costly venture and all other factors are tied into the level of development. The more advance your development the more costly your insurance and repairs.

It enable to keep my resource at a level to repair the damages andallowed for continued development. I learnt the research and development is thekey to proper risk management, identifying the risk and its' impacts can allowyou to prepare for the risk and create opportunities. Resource managementplayed a very circuital role because a balance had to be obtained betweendevelopment and cost to repair damages. It also spoke to the level ofdevelopment, the higher the level of development the more cost the repairs.Community connection was vital in reduce the level of damage after the eventand it speaks to the in reality.

By investing in development, I was able to lock in biggergains both in money and in development level, but I was uncovered if risks occurred.If I chose to prepare for risk, I had to spend my money on insurance andprotection and hold off on upgrading and building. In the early levels, whenrisks were smaller, a good insurance acquired in the beginning made sure that Ifinished the level, but later on, it became insufficient. I playedthe game twice, but managed to reach only level 4 on both tries. I learned thatdecisions have to be made quickly and that a balance between development andpreparation for risk has to be found. Analyzing the two separately is notenough when possible risks are greater, even if it might work in more laid backconditions. I also learned that when risks can be greater, both insurance andprotection are required, especially the optimal use of the two. If I were toplay the game again I would try to think faster, make decisions quicker, and focusmore on protection, not just on acquiring an expensive insurance, but I wouldalso keep the insurance. In terms of development, if the damages were reduced,I think it would be enough to advance to new levels.As a newimplementation in the game, I would make available the cost of protection, asit is stated for the different types of insurance. In this way, players couldmake the decision in a calculated matter, and not randomly. In terms ofchoosing the right path when pursuing risk management I thing calculating theestimated return is important when making choices and in a real environment I thinkthere would be time for some calculus when choosing the right balance between development,knowledge, protection and insurance. Because the cost of recovering from shockscan not be estimated in other way than by looking at past events and historynever repeats identically, I consider it important to have a clearunderstanding of costs when it comes to preparing for risk. We cannot know the cost of recovering from shocks, but we can keep under control the costs of risk management. Besides that,calculating the risk reward of paying for different type of preparation forrisk comes in handy when adapting a certain risk management path. We need toknow the short term drawbacks of every strategy and its long term benefits.Â "78.26.20.198,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-36.0 to 1.0,-28.0 to -15.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"Risk horizon essayThe goal of thisgame is to succesfully manage risks in order to sustain thedevelopment of an off-world colony. Central to this theme comes thebalancing between knowledge about upcoming risks, protection againstthem, and whether or not to get insured for potential costsassociated with the impact of these risks.Knowledge quicklybecomes a factor in the decision making throughout the game. Should Ikeep investing in buildings, or hedge against potential disastersdown the road? More accurate and precise information about thesedisasters lowers their severity and impact. This is achieved throughlooking on the â€œhorizonâ€ù of the colony world, to see theprobability of a specific threat occurring, when and also how severe theymight be. Risks that have a greater severity level than one'sprotection level, are quickly identified and targeted for furtherresearch. One's own protectionlevel takes time to improve, and to succeed in the game you have tokeep this level reasonably high since it comes at a cost of furtherdevelopment. In the beginning these costs are high compared to theirbenefit, since you are starting out with few resources. Later on youhave hopefully paid the cost to raise this level, and should a severeand highly likely threat arise, you can scale the protection level ofyour colony to match this more evenly. This will in turn greatlyreduce the impact of the threat, and even eliminate some of them. For sustained development a growing level of protection is needed. Early on in the gamethe disasters are unpreventable. A good way of dealing with them isthrough insurance. For a cheap cost, you can effectively protectyourself from up to 75% of the cost associated with rebuilding yourwhole society, should a very big threat impact you. Since thedevelopment level is very low, the time to get back on one's feet isalso very low compared to later on in the game. Much like the farmers facing the threat of famines and poor crops in certain parts of our world, insurance allows you to take risk.A key learning pointin this game is that paying for insurance and protection, allows youto invest a lot of your wealth in buildings or further development if you like. One of the reasons forthis is that you can more accurately estimate the downside of anupcoming disaster.  On the other hand, you will also find that theupside is also necessarily lower. Accepting the risks can be gruelingat most, but also rewarding at best. Throughout the gameit is an interesting thing to reflect on, that it's easy to growrisk-averse in the later levels, as the stakes are high and the costof disasters in resources and time to recover are higher. Coming froma fairly safe and risk-free corner of the world, it's hard to imagineaccepting risks of a magnitude like in this game."68.144.64.138,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"In playing the game, I took a couple of attempts tounderstand the interconnecting conditions to pass the first level.

At the beginning of my play I was unable to win lvl 3, because of the lack of research of comets (I didnt find that option before). That proves, that there is no possibility to win without the developement of every area of risk management.While playing the game I tried to analyse the possibility of the comet hit and focus on the development and protection. Only after seeing the comet with very high severity I decided to buy the insurance (almost in every game - but after building some pots = faster development).In my opinion there are several main reflections after playing the game:1. It is very important to develop any field of protection in parallel to the development of business/society/infrastructure.2. Sometimes there is no chance to avoid defeat or an accident, but the succesful risk management provided with the rules from pt 1. could help in rebuilding prosperity.3.

A massive and ongoing investment on comets shocks prevention redounded to security for the island. After playing the game for the first time, I started investing in growing the community connections, preparing them to the comets shocks and raising the islands. Therewith, the damage due the hit was 0% and I didn`t have to invest in pods repairment.

First of all, game strategy is developing the communitywhile meeting many problems along the way. According to me, I chose to makemore and more pods to save the community from the harmful effects. But I alsodid some compromises such as by taking the low budget insurance. In addition, Ineeded more money for upgrading the pods. So, I decided to buy the normalinsurance policy. That will be helpful for achieving the goal. I thinkknowledge part was so much important for preparation of risk development.In my point of view, whenI played the game merely once I took some time to understand the rules andstrategies. Therefore, I was not able to finish the task in the first time. I hadlack of information about the game. Butwhen I tried it second time, I had understood the game policies.

In addition,preparation, knowledge and obtaining insurance to save the community from theharmful effects. But practice required for every game.

It also involves risk avoiding as well as risk taking. Every work haddifferent sort of risk. Sometimes, we avoid the risk but sometimes we take the risk.First, I would add things that help people to understand easily.

Some people may be vulnerableâ€”that is, especially susceptible to losses from negative shocksâ€”as a result of their exposure, internal conditions, and risk management. Second Lesson : Risk management needs to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with the ability to cope once a risk has materialized. Preparation (or ex ante risk management) includes a combination of three actions that can be taken in advance: acquiring knowledge, obtaining protection, and obtaining insurance.This is what is known as the interlinked components of risk management.Third Lesson: Protection and insurance can provide complementary means of managing riskProtection can decrease the likelihood of very severe losses, thereby increasing the probabi-lity of routine losses relative to extraordinary losses. Fourth lesson :Risk management is cost-effectiveâ€”yet not always feasible Not only can risk management save lives, avert damages, and unleash opportunities, but preparation for risk often has high returns.  If I were to play this game a second time, I will first focus on three main things. First knowledge of the type of risk ; then preparation in order to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits ; and finally I will insist on insurance so as to face  potential outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty.What change would I propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live? I will design a game that reflect the reality of my own context, that is focussing on risks that people may encounter in my own environment."81.164.232.180,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"First ofall, playing this type of game is not my cup of tea ... I find it ratherenervating. However, I do understand that in order to win this game, you haveto keep track of your financial situation, get as much knowledge as possible ofthe risks surrounding you (i.e. the comets that might hit with no, slight orsevere damage), protect yourself (although I did not figure out which button Ineeded to press here) â€“ I guessed staying away from the coastline was wise inorder not to be hit by the waves caused by the impact of the comets in the sea.Buying insurance seems a sensible option, but again this depends on how muchmoney you can spend on it and whether it is important to build all the pods onall the foreseen building sites or whether one could live with the idea of onlysetting up a few of them. I wanted to gain more knowledge but wasn't sure where to get it and I must admit the comets followed each other at a frightening speed which made me quite nervous. Keeping calm and acting swiftly also seem to be necessary for crisis management.The firsttime around I definitely spent too much money on insurance. So, the second time around I kept a closer eye onmy budget.If I wereto play it again, I would try to gain more knowledge and get protection at a decent level at a reasonable price, beforebuying insurance coverage. These are exactly the three elements I have learned about basic RM in this game.If I could change anything to the game, I wouldmake the protection options clearer and more visible: building a dam to stopthe waves from coming inland; installing rockets to shoot the comets to pieces;building shelters to help evacuate people; investing in impact forecasting; â€_Â Finally, I guess for young people (or fans of video games)Â this game is self explanatory, for me it was a bit confusing, but I did get the gist."181.224.236.1,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"In the game I assume the role of Managing Director of Risk Management having two fronts: Financial Management and Infrastructure Management, taking into account factors such as Investigations, Insurance and Protection.Â From the beginning I considered appropriate to pay the insurance premium that covers up to 75% while the spherical parallel modules installed.

We can easily make the comparison with someregions of theÂ Earth, such South Asia (Bangladesh and India for example) whichundergoes every year major floods during the rainy season. These countries,which have a great potential for growth in the recent and large movement ofglobalization, have to face multiple challenges about their risk management.During thegame, I have tried to growth my city as quickly as possible. Since collisionsare often repeated, I have invested a lot in insurances by taking the 75 %coverage. I was also spending a lot on protection by raising the level of theground. But there was a problem : my city was not growing enough fast because Iwas missing money to build and improve my buildings, so I had to change my strategyafter level 2 by reducing insurance costs (past to 50 % coverage) andprotection costs(reduce the raising of the ground). This gameshowed me why some less developed countries cut in their risk management(protection, insurance and knowledge); because they are struggling to grow,they will prefer to put much money as possible on their economic development, whichthey believe to be more profitable. They will close their eyes on possibledisasters to save money. But when that disaster will happen, they will have topay high bills in repair, which will undermine their economic growth. I havealso seen that investing in good insurance and protection strategies is moreprofitable when unfortunate event occurs; final costs are reduce andconsequently, major impacts on economic and development are avoided. But havinga good risk management strategy can become too expensive and slow economic development(as I have experienced after level 2). Itâ€™s why I think finding the rightbalance between cheaper but good risk management policies and a reduced butsustained economic growth can be the best solution on a long-term, and even amid-term basis. Even ifthis game takes into principal account the interlinked components of riskmanagement (knowledge, protection and insurance), I think it should pay attentionon a  social  dimension. For example, it would be interestingto know the living conditions of the population, and how these conditionschange after each disaster (in occurrence an asteroidâ€™s collision). Then, wecould act to try to ameliorate them. Also, we could have a bonus objective ofreducing the number of dead (if there are) after each collision, by creating aprogram of learning about how to react to an asteroidâ€™s collision and implantinga system to warn people of the approach of the large rock, for example. Thereby,we would have to confront an additional challenge in term of knowledge.Â "41.33.129.162,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"According to the horizon game we confront some trade-offs,and we should determine according to the available resources which choice wewill take which is based on the information we have and our good knowledge forthe whole face of this information(i.e some information could have a positiveimpact by itself but when we try to make it applicable with other trade-offs itcould lead to a negative impact) for example in the game if you build alot ofpods only without upgrading it could be fine but when you indicate to thecomets you could find that its chance to hit is in its maximum which need tomake some more deep research; in accordance with some kind of insurance plan totry to limit the damage it could happen.So; we need to have a detailed plan about the risks we faceand its probable damages to determine the best protection way and the insuranceplan.

You had to reach a delicate balance between researching thecomets (knowledge), elevating the island (protection), buying insurance and developingthe community. There were also measures of coping by connecting the glowingdots in the aftermath of a comet. When I first played the game, I easily reached level 2, but thenstruggled a bit to move on. The game made it impossible for me to reach aperfect situation where I could be as protected as possible, fully insured, andthen develop. I had to trade off the feelingof safety afforded by a lot of protection and insurance in order to reach thedevelopment goals. Â It was a clear lessonin priorities and how they might need to shift over time. For example, as I gotbetter and reached level 4, balancingÂ reparations and protection got in the way of upgrading the pods, becauseI did not have time to do it and revert to â€œgreenâ€ù before I was hit withanother comet and/or close to out of money. The more I played, the moreI learned that I needed to actually take more risks; I would easily pass the 2first levels, where community development was somewhat minimal and the focuscould be on researching the comets. But as soon as I reached higher levelswhere the community needed to thrive on top of being protected, I would losebalance and end up â€œin the redâ€ù. Therefore, I tried to focus more ondevelopment, and got a bit further.If I look at the game from the standpoint ofmanaging risk in Montreal, Canada, I would add a cost to maintain olderstructures as the game goes on. This is very closely linked to the game, as itrelates to developing community and making sure it thrives. All factors of thegame are important in the situation of Montreal, but could represent lesstangible, natural disaster-like risks. Indeed, Montreal might not be on thepath of important natural disasters, but its road infrastructures have become arisk in recent years, with some unfortunate accidents (for example, an overpassthat fell down and made victims, a solar protection detaching in a tunnelâ€_) andvery large structures in need of replacing (for example, the Champlain Bridge,which was deemed in need of immediate measures and complete replacement). Thegame could represent this situation, as the city has continued to develop andprosper, but would need the added task of dealing with failing infrastructuresand the risk and costs they represent."68.46.141.97,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Game ReflectionThe role was to provide me -the administrator- strategies: basedon knowledge, protection, insurance and the coping ability of mycommunity. The tradeoffs I was experimenting with were a few: until Irealized the strengths and weaknesses of each of them. My first option was based on the decision to build a community of 6 pods, but they suffered a lot, andthe funds available were not sufficient to improve the structures andthe resistance capacity of each of them. So then I went in theopposite direction; I decided to build a maximum of 2 in order torealize what were the advantages the structures will present everytime I improve them, but at attempt 3 or 4 I realize thatthe community connections were suffering because of the minimumnumber of pods, so I increase the number to 4, and it was then whenthe community connections help a lot. But overall the most importantchoice was to perform a constant research on the meteorites, thiswas making the community stronger. The one choice I always decidedto go with, in fact it was my very first move; was to purchaseinsurance. The protection option which was to rise the level of thecommunity was the one I used the less, not because it was notimportant, but because I realized it was the less effective in termsof offering the best results.The ways in which preparation for risk affected the development of the community were definitively in the amount of pods builded. I was scare not to be able to improve these structures into a stronger point, were they would not suffer as much after a possible impact.Â I played the games several times, I started by building a verysmall community, and to concentrate a lot of my funds in developing, but then i realized that research and improvement of structures were key aspects of a successful attempt. I made changes with every attempt, the most important one was the decision to but increase the number ofpods, because the funds were growing with the continuos research andI was able to improve the structure of the pods to make them moreresistant to impact. My final attempts were based on a community of 4pods, with every attempt I realized how important was the constantresearch and the insurance. I learned from the game that knowledge isfundamental because it will provide us with valuable information notjust on prevention but on  coping and reacting with the consequences.The one constant option on all of my attempts was the insurance, infact that was my very first step as soon as the funds were available.I would probably have the option to create two differentcommunities, in order to experiment different strategies and evaluatethe results, this option will most likely be provided only for thefirst two attempt , then the player will have a clear idea of whatstrategy to follow, and the player will only continue with 1 community. I believe this option will be very beneficial at the time of comparing the possible consequences of the several strategies the player will be trying out, but if the option to change the game has to be directly related to the place I live, there will have a to be a option with; again two different communities, but this time the goal will not be to compare strategies, but to realize that each community has very different resources, and how this play a fundamental role at the time of prevention, research, better structures and coping with a consequences."41.206.12.46,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management helps confront risk by predicting how much damage comet will cause (knowledge), leaving you with the option of seeking protection and insurance to help absorb the severity eventually when shock occurs. Therefore, risk management assists to prepare and confront risk through adequate knowledge, protection and Â seek insurance so as to ameliorate severe impact.I discovered that the more time one spends on Research of a comet, the more knowledgeable you are about the degree of protection one ought to facilitate and the more time you have for community connection. Also, the more time you spend on protection the slower your development achievement : although matching protection level to the comet's severity helps the drastic consequences of risk. Seeking insurance on the other hand, becomes imminent after Research is made about the magnitude of impact a comet will cause when it eventually occur, especially when you observe the fast pace at which comet will occur. Therefore, spending time on gathering knowledge about a comet galvanises your preparation while maintaining a balance on protection and seek insurance eventually with a meticulous attention on upgrading pods and developing new ones, taking into consideration time and resources. Â The quest to ameliorate the impact of a comet (research, protection and insurance) to an extent prevents you from upgrading, building new pods etc that aid faster development, which eventually affects community connection.2) I would spend more time researching, being time conscious and maintain a relatively moderate protection that matches a comet and seek insurance when comet's severity tendency of a hit is high. I would ensure a balanced trade-off among knowledge, insurance and protection while maintaining a faster community development with a green meter.The game has taught me that Risk is inevitable but controllable with proper risk management. Resources are limited and as such must be prudently put to priorities as much as Time waits for no one!But with adequate and proper knowledge, Protection and insurance, shock caused by risk will be significantly reduced.3) In the game I feel the risk component being captured are very relevant to my community except for access to insurance which is in the hands of private sector, Â and not easily accessible by a common man. The community where I live is characterised by illiteracy: awareness of the danger of risk and it's negative consequences must be meticulously carried out.Lastly, in the game, the impact of a comet holistically affected all the communities while in a real life scenario, some areas are more prone to risk Â and others not affected even in the same community. In essence, the research component should include an indicator that would tell which particular area in a community is likely to be affected."174.7.48.105,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"When I started the game honesty I was a little confuse inhow to play, it is because I am not good game player, however when I continue Icould understand that be in the game is absolutely easy. Nevertheless reflectingand giving the scenario to the reality I realize the complexity of riskmanagement. Â In this course I have learned the importance of have a goodplan to prevent risk and not only have a good saving to use when the event is coming.In the game I played more than twice, at the beginning I just cover with the minimum,and with this hedge I thought will be fine. The result was not. The second timeI played 50 percent even with this hedge was not enough. Finally I played withthe 75 percent the damages got better.Continue with the idea about, the damages got better, and atthe same time mention that I already mention in the first paragraph, be in thegame is absolutely easy, because you just have to increase the amount, and thatdoes not cost anything for you. The complexity here is be in full action, maybewith lack resources in one country with high corruption, with weak institutions,or with a record of irresponsibility from the company that offer insurance.Playing the game I thought I never like to be in onesituation like this, but at the same time come through my mind situation thatyou cannot control, like natural disaster, financial crisis, accident, etc. absolutelythe best option is be protected. But why I thought I never like to be in onesituation like that, because I thought about developing countries/poor countriesthat do not have the organizational structure, the resources etc. In this course I am learning about how to prevent the riskin many way, for example searching information, in case I am exposed to somekind of disease, between other things, and I am impressed how in my real live Ihave never consider to check some information when I moved for a new place. Butin other hand my worry is about poor countries which are the more and probablythe most exposed to risk because their situation. However one point very important to consider is the goodresult of risk management in many countries with high risk of naturals disasterfor example and how they have achieve to reduce the amount of victim, just forcite a case. I understood the importance of create resilience, be prepareto face the situation, but at the same time I end my reflection with a littlesadness for the countries that continue exposed to the higher risk with the lowerincome, probably the higher risk is live the life exposed to a food shock.The challenge to all human being around the globe is be preparecreate plan of contingence in one world in an accelerate change procuring takeadvantage of the entire situation to win or to get experience to prevent futureevent. One idea could be that developing countries withoutexperience ask information from countries with more experiences in how to be preparedto create resilience and educate the society to be set to face any kind ofevent that put in danger the natural life style of the people in every community.We are all expose to risk without exception; I just hope oneday the most vulnerable have access to save their future in one way moreaccessible.Â "202.137.230.240,0.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Role of risk management in the game is able to minimize the risk in achieving our goals. As we did before, when he first played the game above, we are still wondering and identify how to implement this game. So do I just directly, by pressing the ""exercise"" after a look instruction from the game. I need to follow the ""exercise"" to train the same circumstances as the game actually happened later. So I read the related materials science, insurance, and protection first. After that game rehearsal, and after all was done, I immediately implement actual game. I played game more than once. I intend to achieve better results than the previous results. But it seems to me less successful plays this game. I only pass on level 1. Fact,Â  I couldn't upload the result because until now I could not do it. I tried many times but still can not do this.If I could propose changes to better represent an important risk management options in where I live, I will try to develop aspects of risk management by developing the capacity of human resources first. Case that I want to raise in this essay, for example floods that occurred in Jakarta, Indonesia. In the case of floods in Jakarta, the role of risk management is essential to minimize the risk of a catastrophic flood that would cause physical or moral loss for residents affected by the flooding. There are several ways that can be done to deal with the floods, according to the three key components of risk management, namely knowledge, insurance, and protection itself. The key component of ""knowledge"" is described by increasing knowledge parties interested in the problems of the flood. Government as policy makers what the proper handling, such as increasing the volume of the Ciliwung river dredging in a way so that it can accommodate more rainwater overflow so that flooding can be prevented even further. Society should also increase environmental knowledge in this regard, by way of example not throw garbage in the gutters, which will block the flow of water so as to cause waterlogging and flooding. The second component is ""insurance"", for example by providing insurance for those affected, both life insurance, health insurance, property insurance as well as insurance for damage caused by flooding and high water pressure. Given the expected risk of losing insurance would be at least a thing or minimize the negative impact of floods. The third component is the protection. With the shelter refugees eg infrastructure like building where they planned to evacuate before the negative effects of floods can be minimized. These three components, namely knowledge, insurance, and protection as contained in this course material can be applied in the handling of floods which will be expected to minimize the risks and negative consequences that appear relatively less than before. It is not easy to overcome the problem of floods, because lot of obstacles that may later be blocked, for example incentives, information, behavior, and limited resources. With the amount of incentives and the right to private levels, the social impact of the development can be minimized and environmental aspects remain to be addressed. With the information provided accurately and on time, then the flood disaster can be realized. Information flooding in a point, then it will quickly spread to other places that will lead to early treatment in anticipation of the flood disaster. With alacrity behavior and aware of the possible disasters that may arise, the casualties can be reduced and the anticipation of an emergency medical handlers can be implemented more quickly."197.239.32.35,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The role of risk management in the game was to show thatÂ  as people in the community, we have to share risks in order to overcome the dangers that might strike in the future. This can be done through combining and balancing the components of knowledge, protection andinsurance. Hence, risk is a powerful tool for development.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The choices i had to make were to first of all, consider the time factor since it is a valuable resource and never gained when lost. As a community we can never know when disaster might strike so to be on a safer side and reduce the impact,Â  it is better to balance knowledge, protection and insurance with the time factor at the back of the mind. This is essential in a community because when disaster strikes, few repairs are made due to balanced and adequate preparation.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  I confronted the tradeoff in terms of knowledge by not wasting a lot of time researching especially for those comets which were approaching faster. Therefore i had to instead focus on ensuring heavyÂ  protection and insurance were adequate.At times protection was expensive especially where the community was progressing in development. therefore it was better to do a little more research and insure as well as access the impact of the problem because repairÂ  would be done. Since insurance would be very expensive as the commmunity developed,the tradeoff made was to sensitize the community about the outcome of any disaster.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Preparation for risk affected development immediately in a way that it was cheaper and easier to balance knowledge, insurance and protection.When people in the community are few and resources available, it is easier to curb any impending dangers which might strike hard. After playing the game for the first time,i ensured thatÂ  a healthy and vibrant communityÂ  shouldÂ  be created with maximum protection and insurance so that when disaster struck, few repairs would be required.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  What i learnedÂ  from the game was that protection and insurance resources raised as development increased within the community. Disaster would strike at any minute when one of the two was inadequateÂ  so to avoid too much severity, research had to be done. so these components go hand in hand so that at the end of it all, the community is able to cope with the aftereffects.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The risk management choice that i would propose to in the place that i live would be knowledge. Many people within the area are not well informed with the effects and after effects of a disaster. where there is ignorance, people perish so it is a silent killer. withoutÂ  knowledge people are left in uncertainty and confusion when disasters strike. they are stuck in a confined place since they do not have any resources to cover the damage and cope afterwards. Hence, knowledge would matter in the place that i live."201.149.20.194,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Dear Risk and Opportunities Students and Staff,Here is my 3 minute video reflection about the Risk Management Game.

Game also taught me how we can deploy the availableresources by having knowledge of future risk and its severity and probabilityof facing it. It also taught me the trade-off we have to make in order toprepare and cope after a calamity. I traded off developing less no of colonieswith purchasing broad insurance cover, as after getting hit by a comet the costand time to redevelop a colony was higher. So having less no of colonies tobuild after getting hit by a comet gave me flexibility of redeveloping hitcolonies by having more cash to pay for redevelopment.During the game I acquired knowledge about the chances ofhitting and severity of the hit of a comet, this helped me in increasing myprotection and opting for a proper insurance plan. I learned how acquiringknowledge helps in risk management by opting for a protection, choosing aproper insurance plan and in coping. If given a choice I would like to include in the game ofhaving knowledge of time to rebuilt the damage colonies and time taken inupgrading the colonies from a level to another, as this will give me betterknowledge to develop how many colonies and which colonies to upgrade undercertain time frame.

The role of risk management here was to prevent and lessen the costs of repairing damage caused by the comets hitting Alora. This was done through research, protection, insurance, and community connections. During the game, I had to make several choices, including whether to spend my wealth on upgrading existing pods or developing new pods, whether to spend my limited time on protection or research, and whether to take a chance and develop/upgrade a pod or wait until the comet attack is over. Some trade-offs I made were balancing research with protection and protection with insurance. Preparation for risk affected development in several ways. First, whenever I spent money on protection, the bar's color would turn redder, meaning that my development wasn't going well. However, protection, research, insurance, and community connections also prevented and lessened the damage of the comet attacks, benefiting development. Â  Â  Â I played Risk Horizon several times. After the first time, I took more chances in developing and upgrading pods, as I realized that only that helped fill the bar. I also took more time to research, as that helped reduce damage from comet attacks.There were several things I learned from this game. First, I learned that managing risk is every bit as important as developing. Second, I learned that if not consciously worked on for some amount of time, things such as protection get downgraded. Third, it is worth the time to do extensive research, as data becomes more accurate as you spend more time researching it. Fourth, insurance greatly reduces the costs of repairing damage and thus is beneficial to coping. Lastly, I learned that despite so many comet attacks, my end goal is still to develop the island, so I must take chances to develop and upgrade pods.Â  Â  Â If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would like to change many things to make it more realistic. However, limited to only one thing, I must choose. In California (where I live), we are especially prone to earthquakes. However, unlike in Risk Horizon, we cannot see the earthquakes coming with our naked eyes. We must use all kinds of advanced technology to sense them the slightest bit. In fact, we even have specialists that do just that, and they get payed for it. As a better representation of the risk management choices that matter in the place I live, instead of being able to see the comets in plain view and getting free research, there should be something along the lines of a comet detector/specialist in the corner of the view port that you have to pay for to get research. Comets should be seen just seconds before they crash. This change makes the game much more realistic."14.140.104.54,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Imust say I really enjoyed playing the game, it was more like a simulation ofreal world.

When you sustain damagefrom comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if Ispent more on preparation for risk, I would not have enough money to developthe community, which was required to pass the level.

It also provoked an assessment of the  trade-offs to be taken when making decisions regarding risk management â€“ especially in cases when resources are constrained. For example â€“ does one invest in infrastructure (housing/ pods or broad protection) or does one invest in insurance? The game also made me choose between investing precious time in research or spending time in other activities such as building/ development, buying insurance or developing protection.The more prepared I was for an event â€“ through research, protection and by having insurance â€“ the better I withstood the events. The community links were stronger and I was able to build on the community links after an event. This, together with insurance meant that the damage I sustained was much less when hit by a severe meteor. It also cost less to invest in broad societal protection, low insurance and research (which 'cost time') than paying for high insurance. I was finally able to advance higher in the game when I paid less for higher insurance and put more money into development (by spending more on pods) and by increasing protection for society (to prevent the negative event). The rewards or benefits were higher for reducing risk for society as a whole and developing it than for trying to deal with the consequences of a negative event. I did better when I had a higher level of development. Income was higher when I had more pods and when I had invested more in the pods. This generated more income for me and society prospered.I was able to gain more time to build community connections after I was struck by an event when I had spent more time researching an event. When I had more time building community connections after being struck by a negative event, the damage was often less severe. This was not only beneficial in terms of sustaining less damage, but it also helped in that I was able to focus on developing my island and preparing for other negative shocks.A lesson I learned was that the solution is not found in any one component, and that trade-offs are constantly being made in a changing context and under time constraints. This means that risk management practitioners have to be constantly analysing risks and opportunities, as well as changing obstacles to addressing or acting upon those risks and opportunities.I had played the game a few times and I tried a number of strategies to ensure success. However, I found that the game, like life, is somewhat unpredictable. I did find increased success with more development, research and more community connections. The game also highlighted the obstacles facing risk management. For example, time pressure made it more difficult to choose and undertake activities. If I had to change on thing in the game to better capture one thing that captures risk management where I live, I would add a component to differentiate according to class and gender. Where I live, poor people and women are significantly worse affected by risk shocks than rich people and they take longer to recover. The game could demonstrate this by, for example, showing some pods being worse affected than others and taking a longer period to rebuild. Pods could also be different colours to show different genders."103.16.71.16,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Game Reflection: In the course of playing the gameI learned a few things about risk management:The planet Alora is one that isprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one thatcan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen theimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect theplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:Due to limited resources like time and money. We had to make various decisionsthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming cometswere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the cometâ€™sseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as researchtime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take actionto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,it can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level ofprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect theplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance anddevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching ahigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance. In thebeginning I first started to develop the planet to a certain extent and usingthe remaining for insurance. As the level progresses, due to faster increase infinancial resources, highest insurance and higher level of development was possible. -It is important to manage step by step. Develop the planet in such a way thatit has enough resources for insurance and protection as well. Insurance andprotection is useful for the longer term. Researching about the risk actuallylessens the severity of the comets and gives a clear idea about the chances ofhitting and severity. As risk managers we can protect the planet throughobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according tothe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not causetoo much damage to the planet. Role of insurance: Also because it is not an easy task to protectAlora in time for some of the comets, insurance plays an important role inreducing the costs of fixing the damage. Insurance is required because one hasto be practical about risk, unavoidable risks need insurance to lower thecosts. Without insurance, unavoidable risks cause huge damage, not only on thephysical state of the planet but also the financial resources. Learning outcome: The consecutivetime I played the game I learned to manage the resources available better thatis more efficiently and effectively as well. Suggestion: If I could change the game I wouldpropose a faster version and in that make the following change according to thecontext of where I live; financial resources available should be relativelyfixed as in some countries, financial aid does not come in as fast. Given thissituation, the game would be more difficult in terms of making decisions withlimited and slower growing financial resources."197.248.82.18,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. Role of the Risk management Game; The role of the risk management game was objectively introduce how one would use resources available to take preventive measures against shock. This involved learning how to conduct research to gather necessary information on severity, probability of occurrence of risk, and what action to take in the event that the risk occurs. It helps in the understanding of the various component of risk management i.e. protection, information, insurance and copying.Knowledge - information helps in understanding the shocks, external environment conditions thus helping reduce uncertaintyProtection - helps reduce the probability and size of losses and increases the benefitsInsurance - helps transfer resources across people and overtime, from good to bad states of natureCoping - helps recover from losses and make the most out of benefits2. Yes, i played the game more than once and each time i made sure that i got enough information about the magnitude of the quack, repaired and upgraded the ponds, took more insurance and matched my protection level with the expected severity of the risk. This i did without loosing site on the available resources.

I got to level 2. Risk management in the game was researching incoming asteroids and assessing what to do next; buy insurance, keep building or protect my investment. I tried a variety of options in trying to past levels. At first, I boughtÂ the highest insurance right away. Â I was researching and building, IÂ would only protect a little bit because I was afraid of the green line turning red. I would pass level one and not be prepared in level two for back to back severe impact asteroids.Â  I felt compelled to buy the best insurance coverage.I tried protecting for a whole minute in level one to build up two bars. I would build after the first minute and research only slightly. I purchased insurance only when there was immediate threat of impact.Â  This approach did not help raise the green bar to the level needed to pass level one very often and when I did move forward to level two I would not pass.I did notice while researching until the asteroid when down and missed that researching often helped to reduce severity of the hit or the possibility of hitting.Â  Juggling to maintain building while researching limited my ability to protect. On one hand researching asteroids helped raise my green barÂ faster than protecting.Â  By the third night of me trying to understand the balance I discovered that protecting when the asteroid was notÂ threat did help raise my green bar faster when compared to when there is a dangerous asteroid and I protect my green bar turns red and does not move.Â  This helped me to understanding the timing of my actions.Â  Protecting while building with no immediate threat was good risk management.Â  When an asteroid was dangerous, researching became the action needed for risk management, learning as much as I could and often helping to reduce severity or the likelihood of impact.

The role of risk management made clear that if you don't protect yourself through gaining knowledge of the chance and the severity of the comet hitting, your work on developing your buildings will suffer proportionally to the missing knowledge, protection and insurance. Of course, you can't always have all you want. That's why your rate of development decreases for a period of time, in order to pay for the insurance (I usually bought the insurance at the beginning of the game. 2nd level - 25%, 3rd level -50%, 4-5 - 75%), and increasing your protection. But the outcomes of such a temporary loss are greater than their neglecting. I can't compare the superiority of either insurance or protection, since I played only 1 game; but I can say that for me, insurance was on the second plan, even though I bought it first. I didn't want to risk the huge damage a severe comet would cause for developing 1 or 2 building. I'm sure it would've cost me much more in the end. And so, I put my emphasis on protection. Even though it diminishes your rate of development, when a comet hits, the damage done is less than without protection, or even none, and the money difference from a 50% and 5% can then be reinvested in developing your buildings, buying better insurance, and/or improving your current level of protection. I guess the incentive to get through as many levels as you can, pushes you to risk in favour of the development. I thought of strategising my actions as follow. As long as a comet didn't have a 40+ chance of hitting and severeness of 3 bars, I continued developing, knowing that my insurance and protection are more than enough to have no damage, or subsequently very little reparation. But if the comet had a very high level of severeness, even with a small chance of hitting, I worked on protection, knowing that even if it doesn't hit now, so I will be both prepared in advance and having the opportunity to develop the building without losing anything when the next one came. I can therefore say that thinking ahead and rationalising that the cost you pay now, will save you more than 100% of the money invested plays a key role on how people approach risk management.I have no guesses what I would've done differently, because my strategy allowed me to receive 10/10 points from the first try. Therefore I would have to play the game more times, applying different strategies, cutting off the ones that don't work, because with every level you can adopt a new plan, and so there are tens of strategies to chose between.For the place I live in, I would add one thing. I would put the number of people that inhabit that planet or living in those houses. The number would rise, the more developed a house is. This would give the player more responsibility and he can attribute the losses of lives to the real life, where such things happen everyday. By that I hope that the player will pay more attention to insurance and protection, seeing that lives depend upon him (even though imaginary ones). He will also realise that one type of damage does not affect only a specific group of people, but every single one (systemic risk), realising that you must act not only when it affects you, because you will also need help later."187.240.1.214,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,30.0 to 33.0,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"I apologize about my english, I hope fulfill the questions.Â https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbxPParHEeQfeature=youtu.be"200.116.30.195,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"Essay about the Risk Horizon Game.Â By: Juan David ArenasBermÃºdez.Â The Risk Horizon Game challenged players to develop anassigned village. To achieve this development it was required an importantbalance with an exact proportion of the components we are working on thecourse:Â  Knowledge (got it by theresearch, it let us know about shocks and reduce uncertainty), Protection (tominimize the size and probability of losses) and Insurance (to back up thedevelopment we had reach in the moment). Also copying (the last component) wasnecessary when the meteorites hit. I believe this balance was the role of riskmanagement in the game, without the RM concepts things could get complicatedsince the start and this could have been reflected in the tradeoffs during eachlevel. Â Choices have to been fast and profitable, because timeand money are also influential keys (or obstacles, according as you looked it)for development. They even, for me, are part of that suitable combination orbalance target previously mentioned. These decisions also were mainly aimed toknowledge tool to know the severity of the problems and what sub-decision wasconvenient to make. However, like in real life, you cannot neglect thedevelopment of the locality for being busy just researching, just protecting orbuilding, etcâ€_ (I mean, agents can't focus all the forces just in one tool)â€_ Sothe best option is combining: while you research the problems (meteorites inthis case), you should also begin the relevant constructions (podsâ€™ built) orbuy some convenient insurance (especially if you would deal probably withsystematic risks).Â During the times I tried the game (3 times), I changedmy strategy: I started to research more and protect a little bit less,considering that firstable I had to know which was the problem to face, Â in order to confront it; and secondable, thatit allowed me to save more money.Â I learnt the importance of making decisions trustingin your capacities and looking for efficiency. They werenâ€™t bad or gooddecisions, they were just decisions, but while you integrate the topics thathave been learned (in this case, RM theory) it becomes easier to advance andthese new sets of decisions are more efficient, allowing you to get benefits afterhaving faced the risk (in this case, reach the next level was the reward). Thisefficiency is also achieved when you manage your resources well, in this casetime and money. When you donâ€™t warrant its proper use, they become obstacles,as I had previously mentioned on paragraph two.Â Finally, if I have to add a new aspect or fact in thegame to deal with, based on the place i live (Medellin, Colombia), it would beillegal payments known as â€œvaccinesâ€ù, which are payments made by people withown business (even big companies) to gangs or some criminals sporadically. Incase the person denies to the pay, retaliation is taken by the collectors; so apercentage of the entrepreneurs decide to better pay it, while anotherpercentage request help to the authorities. This is a hard phenomenon tocontrol because some gangs have too much power in here. In the game context,there would be a kind of thieves or gang that often takes a little part of themoney you have."72.197.146.33,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"This game was very difficult for me to start playing and figure out. I was only able to reach level two and it took me 6 ttys to reach level 4. You had to be very care and make sure you where protected and also did your research on asteroids. This game taught me that you can never be to careful when buying protection for yourself. In the end I figured out that I needed insurance and research in order to win, where as in the beginning I thought it was very trivial. If I was to try this game again I would make sure to purchase everything I needed to be safe first, except for the first round because the chance of damage is very low due to the low risk of level one.Â The key point that I took away from the game were how protection is key as well as research. You can't have enough of any and that applies to the real world as well. I need to protect myself from outside forces such as natural disasters by purchasing insurance on things like cars, homes and then buy health insurance as well. I think it is very important to be prepared and protected in every area of your life. This is because in todays age the unexpected happens daily.If I where to add a piece to the game to make it better I would defiantly add earth quakes. Being reminded yesterday of how earthquakes can rattle cites and disrupt life. The earthquake that happened in Guatemala was a reminder to all of us living on faults that it can happen any time.In conclusion, this game has given me a broader understanding of how immanent danger may not seem to scary now but when you are faced with it in the future you will be thinking why didn't I just protect myself. If that means moving or buying insurance its up to you but the most important thing is to always be safe. I believe the premise of this game allows us indirectly see how things can affect and disrupt our lives very quickly. Now its up to you to protect yourself, your family and your belongings, make sure to do it in the smartest way possible and all will be fine. Never forget that danger is lurking in the waters."41.202.240.5,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game is a very simplistic reflection on risk management and shows that there are several issues related to a situation. It shows that you have to make choices, indeed, and I found myself more focussing on the protection and not so much on the insurance and knowledge. It was interesting that on the higher levels however, also the insurance became necessary because there were more and more higher risks of getting hit. I was mostly assured by the effect that protection has: it is an investment that you do in the beginning with a long term effect that is relevant also for future risks. The knowledge is only relevant for that particular risk and therefore less efficient. The insuarnce again is long term although its coverage changes depending on the development of the locality.The first time I played, I did not know what the research did to the possibility of reducing the effect of a hit, so that helped the second time. I also improved on building faster because without that the level can not be concluded. It became quite easy to reach the higher levels once I found out what the best strategy was. I think it is a bit too simple. I would rather keep level one as it is but instead of increasing the number of comets in the higher level, I would prefer to increase the complexity, for example by forcing to make more choices based on the costs (there was not much limit in spending in the game that I played) and considering relocation or different types of protection. Another type of risk could also be interesting to have to deal with because often places have multiple issues and have different ways to protect against them. In the place I live, protection and preparation would be the main actions to migitate. Preparation in order to cope better is not part of the game, but would also  be relevant. Lastly, social, political, cultural factors are not taken into account. Altogether, I think the game gives a nice impression but it is too much simplified which makes it look too easy. It is like other computer games, I guess, that do not reflect the reality."212.253.43.110,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game â€œRisk Horizonâ€ùhas a propulsive structure for risk management in terms of the appearances and controlof: shocks as the effect of damages; internal conditions as the pod status,insurance and , protection controls; various type of comets as representing theexternal environment; achievement of levels as the outcome of the wholemanagement. Â Accordingly, the role ofrisk management in the game is to help grow a sustainable environment in ahealthy way. Â The decisions I made duringthe game were basically the key components of risk management: knowledge,protection, insurance, and coping. To clarify, I was able to understand the predictionof shocks by observing the cometsâ€™ severity and hitting chances as I controlledmy internal resources to reduce the uncertainty such as researching andprotection. Moreover, the trade-offs while I was protecting my pods wereresearching and developing/ building pods or vice versa. Therefore, as I keptexpanding and developing my pods I observed the external conditions (comets) andtook the most relevant action according to the severity and chances of thecomet to hit. Furthermore, when I realized the high possibility of a comet tohit I invested on insurances and increased my protection. However, thepreparation for risk affect development did not propound an immediate response;increasing the protection bar needed too much time and the more protection Ihad the more I could cope with the risks of damages. Thus, I personally would say that having a long termview was the most important feature of the game. Before playing the gameI obtained the instructions from the tutorial, in other terms this was theinformation that I needed for my incentives. Moreover, if I could call this anincident happened in other territory, this was my opportunity to manipulate theoutcomes. If I were to play the game more than once I could probably do abetter cost-benefit analysis whilst I control the trade-offs; by this means Icould manage measuring the predictions more consciously.Â "174.44.72.181,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was one of compromise, adaption, and interpreting the cost-benefit of different resource allocations. Â You had meteors coming, of what size you barely knew, and you needed to spend that money as best you can, all while allocating the proper time and dollars on research. Â When you prepare for risk, thatâ€™s money and resources you canâ€™t commit to development. Â And when you develop, itâ€™s more expensive to prepare for risk. Â You also have to consider liquidity, or stores of money, as you need to preserve some of that for future expenditures, both in terms of investment and paying for damage (with or without insurance).Judging by my only reaching level three, Iâ€™m not sure I can say I truly got what the proper balance was. Â What I did pull out of the game was the importance of that balance, and the difficulty of finding it. Â I kept tinkering with my reliance on insurance, building, and research and a could never find the right mix.

I â€™m sure I would have, with time, gotten their eventually. Â I suppose itâ€™s all just ongoing progress, though. Â Funny because in real life there is no â€˜beatingâ€™ the risk management game.Obviously, solidifying your infrastructure and insuring against losses is a question of opportunity cost: since building your buildings tall makes repairing them more expensive, the value of the more expensive insurance plans, relative the other costs, increases. Â I imagine I could have perfected this for all four variables, finding the correct balance, but Iâ€™m not sure I understood the relationship of the raising the platform and research had. Â I sort of just randomized those to see which was best.If I wanted the game to better represent real life choices, Iâ€™d want the every ten attempts or so to get ruined regardless of how well you played the game. Â Or, at least, Iâ€™d add a simple mechanism for reacting to an external set of pods, one in which their actions alter the proper balance of your variables. Â Additionally, adding the ability to take on debt would be a fun twist. Â You could borrow money to really solidify your circumstances, or even just to develop, but then if you needed the money paid back and something went wrong, youâ€™d have to deal with that."168.167.93.245,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"GAME REFLECTION Risk management played a huge role in the game, it helped meto plan/research then insure n provide some protection as well as coping withthe shocks. The research helped me to know the impending risk and how to best tohandle them. Insurance reduced the amount of money I had to use to repair theshocks once they occur. Protection helped prevent the shocks from occurring. Howeverno matter how I distributed the money between doing the necessary research,buying insurance, putting in some sort protection I had to leave a some moneyfor repairing the community once the shocks occur because if not enough moneyis left for repairing, itâ€™s going to take a much longer period of time torepair the community. Therefore balancing all these four was a necessity;though it was not easy as one cannot 100% predict the future howeverpreparation made it easier to cope with the shocks.I played the game a couple of times and each time I played Itried to do something different. I changed the insurance policies, theprotection I had as well as the research done. The money left for copingdiffered as well, its monitoring was low the first games and increased withtime as I was left with little money to repair one or two ports which hamperedmy developments after the shock. I increased my research with time as well as Irealized it reduced the impact as well as give me more time to get the bonustime. I learned that it is vital to find the right balance between these four. Thereis no need to do a lot of research and from that research you do not takeaction as suggested. For example if the research shows a high level of occurrenceand high level of damage it is important to take some insurance and have somemoney left to repair. Taking some sort of protection will also go a long way inthe future.Should I be tasked with changing something about the game I wouldmake the calculations more clear and stated. For example if a shock occurs itshould indicate how much the damage it has caused and from that damage how muchwas covered by the insurance, how protection reduced the damage and howresearch helped. All these stated in monetary terms because I think it willmake it more vivid. I live in a semi desert country so we are most likely tohave droughts as compared to floods."62.145.89.76,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"MY GAME REFLECTIONI can say that the main role of risk management for this game of Alora world wasthe identification, analysis,assessment,control,and avoidance,minimization, or elimination of unacceptable risks. Through this game I discovered how and why risk management is important forthe development of society or country. I learned by research, protection andinsurance howÂ  to develop alora community to the best of my ability whilemeeting milestones to comets threaten. but despite obstacles, I tried to fillmy development bqr by building and upgrading pods. and this procedure helped meto learn and undestand how to coordinate economical qpplication of resources tominimize, monitor and controle the probability and impact of unfornate naturaldisasters.In terms of knowledge, I reduced the chance of the comet hitting until the impactand I received more time of information to create community connections rightbefore the comet hits: this method helped a lot to boost the protection. And interms of protection; I pressed and holdÂ  the slider, located on the bottomright of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.Through this, I prevented the pods from being damaged by matching the level ofprotection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider.finally; in terms of the power of insurance; I prepared for high severity cometby buying a plan. I mean, by obtaining insurance, pods damaged from waves ofcomets were quicker and cheapper rebuilt. this helped me to recover lostdevelopment.So, for the most part, these methods consisted of identifying; characterizingthreats of Alora community, assessing the vulnerability of critial assets tospecific threats, identifying ways to reduce those risk and prioritizing riskreduction measures based on a strategy. And my choice was to build and upgrade more pods so that I might fill fasterand increase the amount of wealth. this helped me to continue keeping the metergreen by trying to reach my goal of passing another level.Concerning the trade-offs I confronted, I can say that it was not easy to beatthe level in the sense of reaching the indicated on this development meterbecause of the time and also I did not know how to reach the goal in time. Therefore, fromthis game I learned following two elements:1.Â Â Â Â Â  After establishing the context, thenext step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risksare about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, riskidentification can start with the source of our problems and those of ourcompetitors (benefit), or with the problem itself. Once risks have beenidentified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impactand to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple tomeasure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know forsure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring. 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk management regarding natural disastersÂ : Itis important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods causedby comet like in Alora community, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster riskassessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, But if they asket me to developÂ  a newversion of this game, I will increase more money of insurance and to introducepeople in building and upgrading pods. I will try to reduce level.In summary, I can say that this game helped me a lot tounderstand in practice the risk management."82.222.170.18,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk Horizon is a strategy game to teach how and why riskmanagement important for a healthy society.Â Risk Horizon is a nice game that teaches balanced risk preperation and healthy development of the society. In order to achieve success in this game, one has to investigate the researches, consider the limited sources in hand and get insurance for the claims faced.While playing the game; you have to follow the information about the comets that could possibly harm the environment. You have to learn about the chance of hitting, severity and the researches. And then you have to decide to take precautions while developing the community.

(money) People have to spend more time on researches to protect the environment. But as the money you have is limited, you should use this resource in a most balanced way. At one side, you have to develop the community by building new buildings and upgrade these buildings; at the same time you have to take the necessary actions to protect them. These actions are protecting the land and the insurance. By protecting land, you could prevent the harm from the environment and by insurance you could easily repair the harms after a damage.If I produce a new version of this game, I can add some new destroy types like earthquakes fires and etc. to increase the difficulty level. As my country Turkey is the the earthquake zone and there are regular earthquakes in time which had destroyed the buildings and many people died. By the new handicaps, the game players have to decide for more precautions. In this way, game players could learn more about researches and giving decisions for using the scarce resources. In the real environment, people generally do not care about the researches , but they could prevent most of the losses if they care about these researches and get the necessary actions by caring about these information."136.173.162.129,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"I have a compulsive personality which does not lend itselfto playing video games.I read all the texts from videos, the chapter from thedevelopment report and was pleased with my comprehension, however putting itinto practice using the game was for me very difficult.The game is based on risk and how to play protection againstinsurance whilst learning as you go.

In the game I spent as much money as possible and could not justleave it (build up a reserve) to see how I would get on.I wish I had only played the game once, but I had to keepplaying. Since I did not advance past level 3 I cannot say I improved, thoughmy pods were all getting bigger but I kept just missing reaching thedevelopment meter marker, to level 4.I donâ€™t think I know enough to request a design improvementto the game.Â  It may be a bit callous butmaybe if the population of each pod was also incorporated then it would becomeless of a game (or that you would take a bit more care in the choices you take)but keep you focused on what it might be like in a real life situation.As I said earlier I do not play games and only because itwas part of this course, I would not have done it.Â  I hope my aversion to games has not taken awayfrom my learning experience.Â  I am surethough that many students will really appreciate the game as it is a novel wayof working the theories into practice without having to take the responsibilityof having peopleâ€™s lives at stake.Â "108.180.142.78,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Firstly, I would like to say that it took me along time before I did realize how the game worked properly, for instance,regarding the protection I did not know that I could keep that bottom just upand it would be going up. Anyway, after playing the game I could learn somethingnew as the comments at the end of the it always gave me different andinteresting tips. For this reason, every time I was playing better takingbetter decisions to get the best opportunity and benefit taking risks.Â During the hole game,one thing that I have been doing all the time is getting insurance for 75%, asI think that if you have the money, is better to invest in a good insurance andget the highest income in case of a disaster to prevent a crisis. As I said, at the beginningI did not know how the protection level worked, so I didnâ€™t get much protectionand I was losing high percentage of my assets. Slowly I could improve theprotection and get more benefits and get less impact from the meteorites.Furthermore, one moremistake I made it was that I was investing creating a lot of pods spread outuntil I realized that it was better just to build one, a bit later on anotheroneâ€_ and try to update to the next stage at least one of them before finishingthe first level. Also, I started building them together, next to each other toreinforce themselves. We can apply this fact into our normal lives, as if wework together in societies, we can support to each other in case of crisis,help sharing equipment, knowledge on research, etceteraâ€_ Slowly, as I have beenimproving the steps on the game and learning from the tips, I could getmore and more benefit. Unfortunately I couldnâ€™t reach level 3, I have been veryclose but not possible. My conclusion would be that taking responsible management decisions by taking risks, we have the opportunity to get better benefits or less damage avoiding crisis learning from the past experiences.Â Regarding the choice Iwould made if I could change or add something on the game, I would add thepersonal facts that can happen, not only externals, like get stolen, or notbeing able to work for diseaseâ€_ However, that would get the game much morecomplex and I think that made as it has been done is good enough to make uslearn what we need to learn and to implement what we learntÂ "85.183.130.138,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"(I'm not a native English speaker ;-))The idea ofrisk management in the Risk Horizon Game was to lower the damage caused bycomets and to support development. I played the game quite often and I always tried to change the expensesof risk management but the result was basically always the same â€“ game lostafter level 2/3. My first idea was to spend as much money as possible onresearch, protection and development and not to focus on one of them. In almostevery level I chose to get the best insurance though as it appeared that thecosts of damages were always higher than the insurance costs, so insurance wascost-effective. I also tried to spend a lot on protection because it loweredthe percentage of damage significantly. So, I basically tried to balance theexpenses for risk management equally. I expectedthat to be the best way to lower the damage but it actually wasnâ€™t. I got thebest result when I didnâ€™t spend any money on research but a lot on protectionand development, esp. development. It is true that the more money I spent onrisk management the lower the damage and the costs to repair the pods were. Butwhen I did it like that, the bar on the left side was always red and I lost thegame. Sometimes, the more money I spent, the worse it got, so in that case the game did not alwaysconfirm what we learned in the course. But, when you have the financialresources and the only expense you have is risk management, then whatâ€™s thepoint of not spending it on more effective risk management but saving it? Sothatâ€™s one of the things I learned from the game â€“ that even when you have theresources and you spend them on risk management, it is not a guarantee that is works. What I alsolearned is that sometimes you are just lucky or you are not. When youâ€™re doingquite well during a level and a bad comet hits you in the last few seconds, thebar turns red and you lose. If that same comet has hit me some time before, Iwould have had enough time to recover, so sometimes it is just all about luck.So, what I would change about the game is the division into levels and the strictdeadline. Of course, time is a factor and the faster you can recover when a shockhits you, the better. But in real life there is no deadline either, so thatwhen a shock hits you close to a deadline you are lost and your risk managementwas worth nothing.. so, to sum it up, it was an interesting but frustrating game to play, which sometimes did and sometimes didn't confirme what we learned before."120.148.217.103,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1) The role of risk management in the game is to brace the city from negative shocks while increasing developmental points.Â While furthering the game, iâ€™ve noticed the trade-offs between research and adding/upgrading pods, raising land-level and developmental progress bar and to only be able to research one comet at a time. The game reflects trade-offs as an side effect of limited resources. Funds for scientists may be taken to help with construction, insurance comes in different prices and coverage and that less research also meant less preparation time and coping abilities. Land protection (raising it) could mean all efforts would be put into it instead of further development tasks (hence the development bar turning into red, a halt).I made sure to always buy the maximum coverage of insurance (saving up was quick) at the start of every game and juggle my time between upgrading/adding pods and research as both are very vital to counteract the comets. When money is abundant, the pods are doing well and there isnâ€™t any comet in sight, Iâ€™d put some time into levelling up the ground for protection.Â Because this doesnâ€™t just affect the current level Iâ€™m on, but the game also brings the level of protection/resources I have to the next level (except the insurance, which were once-offs). This indicates the ability for preparation to have a long term beneficial effect for the planet and to be ready for any potential coming comets/risks.2) I've played the game 2-3 times in a row. The maximum I got was until level 3.Â After the first round of excessively upgrading the pods and raising land level, I've learnt to put ample time into researching comets. Realizing (via the hints given at the end of each level) that it would give me more time in 'community connection' post negative shocks. This is reflected in the real world that through connecting, communities are able to share disaster coping methods or share resources.3) Â The game is good on its own, the story is told, graphics good and most importantly, getting the course takers to understand firsthand what it's like to have to juggle risk taking management and their pros/cons that follows.Â For where I'm from, I would wish there to be more clarity in the state. At least for the community to understand what risks are being taken or the opportunity costs. It would be best if politicians could be transparent in what fundamental perspectives they're coming from and how the paths they're taking would benefit the problem. At the same time, it is vital for the state to close the gap between the status of the community (insurance, protection, education) and the abundant risk the state is impatiently trying to take upon."41.77.13.231,6.0 to 10.0,0.0 to 2.0,24.0 to 42.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"CfbQ8Tj Â Game ReflectionÂ Risk management is all about preparation for risk by collecting enough information about the riskÂ and taking the right action toÂ prevent it orÂ cope with it after it strikes. Financial resources in another important ingredientÂ which is used to protect from risk or insure against it. Risk management helped to remove and reduce theamount of damage that would be caused by Comet in the area. The area of research played abig role in managing the risk because the information that was gathered throughresearch greatly contributed to the choices one would make to manage the risk.The information gathered would either be used to allocate resources to protectthe community while at the same time investing in development that they need.Proper management of risk worked for the good of the community because it killed two birds with one stone by protecting the people and development.The information gathered in research also helped to take the step further to planand buy insurance where it was likely that the comet would hit severelyÂ tocause damage. Building the protection wall is a one off investment whose benefit spread for a number of years. In theÂ period whenÂ the impact of the damage was minimal the protective wall was enough measure to manage the risk.The knowledge that was gathered gave the meÂ the opportunity to effectively manage the resources a nationÂ by choosing between protecting the people and protecting the community or both depending on the severity of the case.Â I also made sure that I was prudent in my expenditure andmaintained focus so that the money was spend not just any how neither Â on development only nor on risk management butI ensured that the expenditure was strategic. The game helped to make use of informationgathered through research by interpreting it and then put it to use. The preparation for risk really has an effect on developmentin thatÂ by building the protection wall enabled the developmentthat took place to beÂ sustained. The cost of implementing riskmanagement activities enabled the area to have sustainable development andattracted more development. The health community is the important factor for economic development besides government efforts to develop the area by providing the source of employmentÂ .Â When I played the game the first time I never reallyunderstood the gameÂ because I did not go through the tutorial.. It was after doing it over againand again and spirit of not giving up that I understood it.Â . The game enabled me to learn that development is achievable where there isproper risk management. It is risk management at the end of the day whichbrings development to any people. I also learnt that risk management anddevelopment both require resources and unless the two are well balances therecan be no development in an area or the development that had taken some time tobuild can crumble just in a twinkling of an eye. Natural disasters cannot bethe reason for excuse to protect the community or cause of failure for developmentbut that they are and opportunity for development.Â The game only focused on one risk as if that was the onlyrisk that usually hit the area. I would add the economic riskÂ as another area of focus. I would add the risk of financial mismanagement andeconomic risk which are to do with behavior shortfall. This therefore meansthat that risk management is the foundation for development and must always begiven theÂ attention that it deserves ."41.189.161.62,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Â  Â Â  Game Reflection ExerciseÂ Â Â Â  Risk Management is a crucial aspect of our day to day life:from the minutest detailed aspect of our life to the most elaborate ones. Managing risk is just having in mind that things would come your way (whether good or bad) and putting in place adequate procedures to better handle the shock or forestall the shock all together.The role of risk management in the Risk Horizon Game cannot be under estimated. Having a little knowledge in risk management,i was able to identify the potholes in my first game,find out what brought about them,and put down measures to be resilient to the comet shocks in the subsequent levels. I realized that i had in my power to actually control the probability and impact from the comet shocks by just the way i played the game, building the pods and managing my insurance purchases. Taking into consideration the three components of risk management:knowledge,protection and insurance- the fore knowledge i had of the game from the tutorial session,lessons i got from the game on how to protect myself by building,fortifying and upgrading the pods and managing my insurance. Risk Management helped me further understand the concept of opportunity cost,forgoing one thing for another because the former is much expensive,hence the cheap one will be purchased for the mean time and when the money is now enough,the first is then purchased. I was also faced with the difficulty of allocating my scarce resources (money) into constructive planning and insuring my projects. Â Â Â Â Â  Taking on risks is necessary to pursue opportunities for development. The risk of inaction may well be the worst option of all (World Development Report 2014,page 4.) had i just left off playing the game after the first level or probably, not even ventured at all,i would not have mastered the intricacy of the game to have even played up to the fourth round. I lost my first round and a few others because,apparently, i didn't pay much attention to the very little information that was conveyed to me during the tutorial session. The subsequent sessions were a success because i learned from my mistakes and put in a few touches like checking for information on the comets and upgrading my structures.Â Â Â Â Â Â  In developing a new version of the Risk Horizon game,i would make it a point to develop it in such a way that the game can be played on any device and at anywhere. For example, the game can only be played on a desktop as it is not supported on tablets. If someone has a deadline to meet,and at the moment,the only device he has by him is a tablet,he wont be able to participate in the game. Also i would develop it in such a way that other flash players can be used to view it and not only the Adobe flash player.

In this game, I think the role of risk management is making proper environment of risk management. I think knowing(research) strength of risk is important, and keeping(saving) resources is very importantÂ toÂ have a good protection about riskmanagement,Â at the sametime make a decision about joining insurance is important too. In this game, SomeÂ  risks are chances too low to occur, have to check the strength of the risk, if that risk was strong, I have to take insurance, if not, I can protect if for self-insurance. In contrast, Some risks are can predict must occur, strength are high, I have to prepare internal conditions to confrot those risks. but those strength are not high, I just stand by and watch those risks. In this game I got a scheme about managing risk have to make chain structure between internalÂ and external environments. And knowing risks are Â can make downÂ uncertainty of themÂ , Joining insurance is not always the correct answer, In the process of coping risks, I realize the importance of social infra working. If some society have enoughÂ reosurces to confront risks can concentrate on afterÂ occur risk,Â if not, we haveÂ to prepareÂ about manging risk discover immediately.Â 2. The first time, I just built 3 towns on the planet. Because if I build many buildings at same, it is too difficult to manage occured risks. I can manage most of all early in the game, but once occured high risk problem, I found there is not enough money to repair out planet. It can says lack of resources, I finally faild to rebuild my planet. The second time, I just left minimum of money, invest all of themÂ to build more towns on the planet. I felt there are not enough moneyÂ early in the game, but whenÂ myÂ planet damaged by risk, IÂ found there are enough resources to repair my planet.Â Through this failure, IÂ have learned the importance of building a strong foundation for improve risk managemnent.3. In my opinion,Â If there added more uncertainiy in the game,Â can have more reality.Â FirstÂ of all,Â in this game, all of risks can be researched by me, and thereÂ are noÂ suddenessÂ outbreakÂ some risks.Â On the second thereÂ was just one reigion on the planet, so weÂ can't experience interaction ofÂ two or more reigion. If making some systems canÂ exchange resources or trade, itÂ will beÂ more interesting manage risk game.

If I played the game again, I would have developed more podsearly on and would have spent less time and resources upgrading the existingcommunity.Â  I think that having a largerquantity of basic pods rather than few upgraded pods allows you to have alarger impact. Additionally, I would spend more time and resources on researchas I could have avoided some initial damage to my village if I had adequately preparedmyself.One characteristic of development that was missing was theinfluence of policy and government.Â Policy is something that cannot be avoided in development, and it canhave both a positive and a negative impact on a community.Â  This would have added another element ofstruggle and would have given a more accurate portrayal of the developmentlandscape."200.218.213.80,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Â  The game is about Alora, a world constantly achieved by fallingcomets, which ones restrain the growth possibilities of the world.Â  The central role of risk management, in charge of the Lumminator,is to enable the community development by deciding how and when invest inproductive capital (by building and upgrading pods) and directing the resources(time and funds) to:Raise the height of the community, what can be understood as     protection, since this reduces the probability of loses from negative     shocks (literally, in the case of Alora);Hire insurance plans;Or research the threats.Â  Despite the trade-offs between those three issues, we can saythat knowledge is overriding, since it's impossible to do a good allocation ifwe don't know which are the risks or what can be the impact assuming the event.Thus, the preparation not only improve the short term allocation by giving youtime to protect appropriately, as reduces long term costs by creating a bettercognition of the threats and, not least, opportunities.Â  By playing the game for the first time, I didn't reach thedevelopment goal, since I spent too much in protection, and less in productivecapital. That brought an important reflection: the fear of losses hinder orgrowth, and the risk management is a not the aim, but a mean to reachdevelopment. With that in mind, a change to more dashing strategy seemed to bethe best choice. But wasnâ€™t. With more advanced features, without a goodprotection and insurance, the losses became also bigger. The main lesson wasthat we may reach a balance between insurance (cheaper and risky) andprotection (expensive and reliable), based on knowledge, all as set of means tothe main goal: the development of our society. Itâ€™s also important to emphasizethe power of a community working together, taking care of each other.Â  The game makes a very good job by simulating risk management, butI think that it should be even better, at least to our reality in Brazil, andcausing no loss of plainness, if we could add the possibility to borrow moneyin crisis time.

The good preparation and effective copping not only significantlyreduces the damage caused by the comets, but also boost a stable and sustainabledevelopment of the community. Inmy trials of the games, I tended to balance my resources (time and money) amongknowledge, protection, and insurance. Knowledge is a main consumer of time andrelatively small consumer of money; protection not only has large financialcosts, but alsotakes some amount of time to build up; renewing insurance does not take time,but does have financial costs. Eg., making communityconnection is equivalent to raising maximum 3 bars, so we donâ€™t need to spend marginally expensivedollars on raising the landÂ  after we have reached reasonable protection, on the other, it tellsÂ  the upper limit of copping, so I can notfully rely on researching and making quick community connections, but have tokeep the protection always at proper level, being aware that I can raise another3 bars, and if anything happensbeyond my expectations, insurance can play out as the last resort. I like to buy the 33% insurance, because, in terms ofthe ratio of the coverage and cost, 33% package yields the best.Â Â Preparationfor risk may seem to impede development immediately,Â  since they cost money, which otherwise can beused to invest into Pod upgrades, and it costs time. But in the long run, itactually help to accelerate the development, which would otherwise be pushedbackward significantly with the hit of comets, especially at more advancedstages, when the comets are more frequent and the damage is more severe. Â 2.Â Â Â Â In my first play,I didnâ€™t spend time in research, which became my bottleneck as I didnot have enough money to constantly keep my protection bar at highlevel to shield from external shocks. Besides, I lefts a fewlands deserted rather than developed, this seems problematic lateron, as too few pods would not generate enough money to develop further and manage risk. Â The mainthings I learned were 1)Â Â Â Acquiring bothgeneral knowledge and specific knowledge about a particular comet help us to make better decision on resourceallocations and more effective copping after the negative outcome happens. 2)Â Â Â Protection andinsurance well balance each other, act as another two pillars in riskmanagement. 3)Â Â Â Effective copping(making quick community connections) not only requires a fast action after thedisaster happens, but also well preparedness (such as research)3.Â Â Â Â I would make twochanges if I were allowed to.Â  Â I would makeresearch more costly. The currently research seems to be a main consumer oftime, but not money. I would think in real life, research (not only limited inscience and technology) requires significant amount of financial inputs, and inmost cases, the more negative impacts the comets potentially have, the moreresearch resources it needs. Â I would makethe timing of the comets less predictable. In real life, the timing of risk isunknown in many cases, such as terrorist attacks, tsunami, and earthquake. Thecurrent setup has all the comets attack time being known, and make us easier toget preparedÂ  (than what happens in reallife.)"62.145.89.76,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"MY GAME REFLECTIONI can say that the main role of risk management for this game of Alora world wasthe identification, analysis,assessment,control,and avoidance,minimization, or elimination of unacceptable risks. Through this game I discovered how and why risk management is important forthe development of society or country. I learned by research, protection andinsurance howÂ  to develop alora community to the best of my ability whilemeeting milestones to comets threaten. but despite obstacles, I tried to fillmy development bqr by building and upgrading pods. and this procedure helped meto learn and undestand how to coordinate economical qpplication of resources tominimize, monitor and controle the probability and impact of unfornate naturaldisasters.In terms of knowledge, I reduced the chance of the comet hitting until the impactand I received more time of information to create community connections rightbefore the comet hits: this method helped a lot to boost the protection. And interms of protection; I pressed and holdÂ  the slider, located on the bottomright of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.Through this, I prevented the pods from being damaged by matching the level ofprotection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider.finally; in terms of the power of insurance; I prepared for high severity cometby buying a plan. I mean, by obtaining insurance, pods damaged from waves ofcomets were quicker and cheapper rebuilt. this helped me to recover lostdevelopment.So, for the most part, these methods consisted of identifying; characterizingthreats of Alora community, assessing the vulnerability of critial assets tospecific threats, identifying ways to reduce those risk and prioritizing riskreduction measures based on a strategy. And my choice was to build and upgrade more pods so that I might fill fasterand increase the amount of wealth. this helped me to continue keeping the metergreen by trying to reach my goal of passing another level.Concerning the trade-offs I confronted, I can say that it was not easy to beatthe level in the sense of reaching the indicated on this development meterbecause of the time and also I did not know how to reach the goal in time. Therefore, fromthis game I learned following two elements:1.Â Â Â Â Â  After establishing the context, thenext step in the process of managing risk is to identify potential risks. Risksare about events that, when triggered, cause problems or benefits. Hence, riskidentification can start with the source of our problems and those of ourcompetitors (benefit), or with the problem itself. Once risks have beenidentified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impactand to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be either simple tomeasure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or impossible to know forsure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event occurring. 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Risk management regarding natural disastersÂ : Itis important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods causedby comet like in Alora community, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster riskassessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, But if they asket me to developÂ  a newversion of this game, I will increase more money of insurance and to introducepeople in building and upgrading pods.

Sometimes I could protect it, and sometimes because of the lack ofenough time, I had to prioritize and cope with the damage. There were threedifferent ways to manage the risk, the best of them between researching,insuring or putting the planet higher, was with knowledge. I mean, the more Istudied the threat the more time I had to make the damage lower. So it wasbetter to start to study the comet as soon as I saw it coming up to me.Â Although Ihave only introduced one code, I played more than six times, and every time Ihave played, I have changed my strategy to find what was the best option tominimize the damage and to pass to the next level. Once I found the way to doit better, I tried to improve on it. So, the most important thing that I havelearnt about risk management is you have to try to see the problem (comet) assoon as possible, and study it. When preparation is weak the damage is worse.The more you know what kind of problem is coming, the more you can measure whatkind of solutions fix better because, as in real life, there was a limit, themoney. And a goodÂ  preparation for riskwill reduce losses.Â As I couldsee in the game, a nation not only have to be prepared to cope with his ownproblems, distribute the resources to build more or less pods for growing upwhile the planet was being attacked. Problems were coming from outside time andtime again, so I had to learn how to deal with, or I would not pass the level.In the place where I live (Ourense, Spain), every summer we have to suffer lotsof fires because of the extreme heat and the lack of responsibility of somepeople who do not care where to put their rubbish or papers during a day in thecountrysideÂ  . We know it is going tohappen, fields that burn in a couple of hours have a resilience of years. Sothat, we know when (in summer),Â  more orless we know the severity, we have got an acceptable number of firemen, butwhat we do not have is environment education, respect to the future generation,and conscience with the problem.

I had experience by making a commercial game for my brand before.Post Game Experience Comments:The role of risk management part isreflected by the â€˜protectionâ€™ button and the â€˜researchâ€™ in the comet. When thecomet come even we had prepare with the insurance, the protection also canâ€™thelp much. Probably the message is clear yet the game have many bugs that makethis game are less-educated but annoying. The insurance button also canâ€™tfunction well, didnâ€™t describe which type of insurance is available (if itâ€™sonly allowed one time basis). Again perhaps the bugs doesnâ€™t support with slowinternet connection.The preparation seem uselessbecause thereâ€™s no button to measure whether we had enough, less, or notsufficient protection that given by the fee of $1. I donâ€™t see any changes inthe landscape or around it. The game is poorly sets up.The research so called power, yetthereâ€™s no feedback whether the research are sufficient to make the â€˜severityâ€™decrease or maybe the â€˜chance of hitâ€™. Itâ€™s just cost $5 with bars colored, notto mention the less responsive bars when we hit it.Â As I keep on trying the game, itdidnâ€™t show remark that the failure after level 2 and repeat for only relevant levelbut also no clue that we had to begin again. The setting of this game seem justautomatically bring player to downgrade to level 1 and itâ€™s such a lessmotivating game with knowledge that are superficial! My previous vendor incompany can do better than this. The way I learn it is very much different frommy expectation from the theory or the story tutorial from the game itself. Itspoor made game!To change the game is doing theopposite as what my input above and also to make it more user-friendly. Thegamer donâ€™t like to play a game that too hard to achieve especially when it comesfrom the bug-error! To be educated, game should bring more joyful experience oflearning, not intimidating or giving gradual level of difficulties, to make theunderstanding of key message convey intelligently. I canâ€™t relate the game withthe theory given from the entire professor in World Bank said in their videolecture.Education should be fun in orderto give understanding and inspire the next action.

I had to make choices asto how I would evenly distribute my time when it came to gaining more knowledgeabout the meteors, protecting my pods more, and buying more insurance toeventually lower the costs if ever there are damages done. The preparation ofrisk did not immediately take effect since by buying more pods, buyinginsurance, and protecting my pods, I was spending my money, but when themeteors came and hit my pods, all of the risks I took paid off. By building andupgrading more pods, I was able to have a wider connection that helped decreasethe damage done by the meteors, and by buying insurance, costs were lowered if evera meteor did hit some of my pods. Â Iplayed the game twice since the first time around, I lost the game at level 1.My mistake in my first attempt was that I was so focused on protecting my podsthat I wasted all my money on protection instead of insurance, and buildingmore pods. So when the time came that a meteor was about to hit, I barely hadany connections and the damage was too severe that what was left of my moneywasnâ€™t able to cover the costs. I also wasted my time protecting the pods thatI forgot all about gaining more knowledge about the incoming meteors. Â WhatI learned from the game is that knowledge, protection and insurance are allequally important when it comes to risk management. By gaining more knowledgeabout an incoming risk, you get to know how to better face the risk when thetime comes, and you become more ready for the risk as well. By allotting justthe right amount of protection â€“ not too much nor too little â€“ you reduce thedamage that can be done by the risk. And by buying insurance, you reduce costsof damage done by the risk. Â If Iwere to change the game, I would add a source to where all the money is comingfrom. May it be a certain pod that handles the businesses or markets, orsomething else. It may be a bit of a challenge, but it will make the game morerealistic since money doesnâ€™t really flow that freely into the market.Â "82.246.169.132,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"In thegame, the role of risk management was to fight against natural disasters,represented by comets, by managing research, protection and insurance in alimited time.I choose togive priority to research and protection, continuing the development of thecommunity in order to improve its wealth constantly and as quickly as possible.Indeed, when protection is strong enough, there are no damages, so insurancesare useless, and we know how strong the protection has to be thanks to the observationof comets and by accumulating knowledge about the dangers.Thisstrategy was sufficient to win the level 3 of the game, but I think, in alonger run, I should have bought insurances, because it's possible that after acertain time, a more dangerous comet or several comets fallen at the samemoment would have destroyed protections.Risks aresmaller when people get more knowledge about their real level and possibleimpact. This enable the community to prepare itself for natural disasters bybuilding protections and coping.

This is the greatestlesson that I got from the game.I had to know the kind of risk that I faced, thelikelihood of its occurrence and the severity: i had to strike a balancebetween the resources and the protection measures I took. For shocks with themost severity and high possibility of occurrence, I researched more and investedquite a lot of resources to buy insurance. On the other hand, i ignored shocksthat have a high risk of occurrence but no severity on my community, as much asI had spent time and resources to gain knowledge of their existence.I made sure that I wasnâ€™t caught up in the risk managementprocess and forget about development of my community, with the knowledge ofrisks and insurance in place, I channeled my resources to development of newstructures and upgrade of existing ones. Preparation for risk on time meantmore resources for development in the long run.QuestionTwo:Having played the game twice, the second time I learntthat I donâ€™t have to invest so much resource on all risks. I learnt that I shouldhave knowledge of all risks but I should classify them based on the probabilityof occurrence versus the impact. The impact is the most important as there somerisks that have a high probability of occurring but have no impact and thusinvesting on them isnâ€™t a priority, the converse is true.QuestionThree:If I were to redesign the game I would incorporate a riskelement that brings about opportunities if well managed .Example, too much rain(flooding) in an area. If well managed, the water can be channeled Â to dry areas of the community for irrigationpurposes or be used to plant crops that do well in water logged areas e.g. rice.The game has negative elements of risk and totally ignores the positive side ofrisk."103.16.70.11,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management played a pivotal role in this game inprioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them. Its role can be outlined asbelow:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To ensure long-term survival of the community ofAloraÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To provide immediate protection and relief fromshocks through risk management tools such as power of protection, knowledge and insuranceÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â To ensure timely and justified protection at thetime of crisisÂ Important choices had to be made for each crisis accordingto its severity. Due to limited resources, it wasimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimumutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching theisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basisof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance ofa hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I wouldimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gatherknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal insafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, beingcomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making atrade-off between risk and resources, I wasable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.While making preparations for the shock, again atrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due tolimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted sothat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would notupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buyinsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on developmentdue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain moreresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resourceswas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoidedby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of developmentslowed down the process of growth of resources.Â Having played the game more than once, I learnt certainvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.Initially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize therisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized thatdevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick paceto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary toprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, Ibegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordinglyspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community againstthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive thebarrage of incoming comets. This game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-worldcrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of timemanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct andjustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.Â Hailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize thatcorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequatesocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in riskmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a justand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice toall citizens of the community.Â "174.6.163.177,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Â The role of risk management in the game was to support and guarantythe development of the community of the world of Alora that faces continuouslythe risk of falling comets that can hinder the development. Risk managementplays an essential role in the game because without it wouldnâ€™t be possible tohave development in the community. It is extremely necessary a good managementof research, protection and insurance. The balance of these three aspects ofrisk management prepares and protects the community from future shocks, copingand learns with them while in the same time the community continues to grow. In the game a lot of situations appear to confront thestrategy of making choices to develop the community while managing risks. Theresources are the central choice of the game, first of all because nothing can bedone without it and them because it is crucial to manage in what will be spentand when. It also has to be considered chose between long term protection andknowledge when comets approaches the atmosphere or considered both against insurancethat is part of the process of coping with the consequences. Sometimes in thegame I had to trade-off long term protection to knowledge to have more time tomake connections and lessen damages. In the case of insurance I always preferredto have it. Also, immediately, preparation for risk affects development, especiallyif is bad manage, because if the resources are not balance the community doesnâ€™thave enough to prosper. But after some time and if is well manage, preparationfor risk contributes to protect the community from shocks and their possible consequences.Â If I played the game only once in the next time I wouldmanage better the resources by not spending all with the most expensive insuranceand building plots until nothing left; have more knowledge through spendingmore time in research and in consequence have more time to make connections inthe community; manage when to spend time and resources with long termprotection; and give more attention to the update of the plots that leads thecommunityâ€™s development. Alternatively, if I played the game more than once, afterthe first time I would spend less with long term protection and more time withresearch.Furthermore, one of the main things that I learned from thegame is that is essential to spent resources preparing for risks. When a cometreach the ocean and damage the community the benefits of research, insuranceand long term protection appear and make all the difference by preventing fromthe consequences and also coping with them if thatâ€™s the case. Other learningis the importance of balance the resources along the game and to be strategic todevelop the community while managing risks. Imaging that I amresponsible for developing a new version of the game I would propose some risk managementchoices to represent a matter of public health in the place where I live. In mycommunity there is a kind of insect called Dengue that contaminates thepopulation in various levels and can lead to death. There is no vaccine forthis disease and also no medicine specific for it. What I would made in thiscase is reduce the insurances and add and invest in more long term protectionsince is possible to completely avoid the development of this specie.

At first I failed to understand how to improve my skill. After few attempts, I started to learn the plan. The game is about creating something and then protect it with your available funds. The successful protection will help one to lessen the damage when any disaster will really arrive. At first I attempted to use two plots with the money and then protect the surrounding when the cash flow is above the requirement. The management of using the money will help to alleviate the losses in future. Now I am attempting to answer the questions.1.The role of the risk management is the successful protection of the created product.The trade-offs is the price of the product and its protection cost. If more products are made, more money would be required to protect them. So, the trade-off is to manage the product development and fiscal usage.It seems to happen immediately sometimes; otherwise they usually occur after some time.2.Â If I only play once, I will sure not build so many setups altogether. Because if more setups, we need more protection. But there's not enough money. So, any disaster will make one total bankrupt. I will surely try to build less setup for keeping the risk lesser.3.Â The game is awesome and it helps to get some idea about planning and risk management. I will make the game avatars more friendly and realistic. FAQ or how to play occasionally doesn't work. Better if we can integrate some learning environment of the game while we are making mistakes.

On the one hand it was important to gather the information about the comets and on the other hand to level up the plots to protect them from damage once they are hit by a comet. Furthermore it was also important to take the appropriate amount of insurance. There was a trade-off between research and protection. I always tried to reach the necessary amount of protection to avoid damage. If you did a lot for risk preparatio , the development lacked behind after some time. But if you spend a lot time and money on risk preparation, the damage is less in comparison to no risk preparation. I played the game twice and tried to find out more about the comets and spend more time on research. The main things I learned from the game are that you have to take many different things into account when you want to do an robust risk management. You have to be flexible and it is not a good decision to stick to old plans when the circumstances are changing. With a changing environment and changing conditions you may have to adjust your plans and underlying assumptions. It is always important to look into the future to prevent or to lower shocks. Nonetheless one should not forget about the past event, because it is a good opportunity to learn something to prevent future events. I live in Germany. One could say that i live in a relatively safe country with not a lot if risks. With respect to the European Union we are dependent from other countries. Therefore I would suggest to have another planet which represents our partner countries. Our damage should be in some way independent from our damage. Furthermore we should have the opportunity to help them or not. This should in turn influence our damage or even more our chance to recover from the event.

Becauselimited recourses/ pressure of timeÂ - not enough time to reach the protection level which could reduce theseverity.My decisionto was to invest resources in insurance of maximum coverage and spend time on researchto create community connections. Result of this action â€“ destruction level notvery high and because of insurance low cost to recoverÂ  fully effective of village. Because of thehighest option of insurance I could spent the small amount of cash (limited recoursesat the beginning of the game) and rebuilt all building almost in the same time.I thing that if I made a different choice â€“ fully protection as main goal â€“ notenough time to reach enough level I would failed in this scenario.I played 2times, the first time reach 6 level and the second time only 5. What happened thatthis second time I got the worst result? The high risky shock ( fully severityand chance of hit) at the end of time to reach a goal. I had got enough recoursesso I took fully insurance and focused on increasing protection to maximum levelâ€“ not reached before the comet strike â€“one level of protection not reached. I didnâ€™tspare enough time to research. The result: the shock strike and make averagedamage ( because high protection), witch high insurance I could restore destroyedbuildings with low cost. This action reduce the effective of village and becauseof this it was not enough time to rebuild the damage and have enough effectivesto reach goal before times out. The bettersolution would be focused also research not only on protection.Itâ€™s obviousthat we can not predict all consequence of shocks, we can decrease the risk ofthis treats. Well prepare plan should contain the long perspective of time â€“ weshould consider the consequents of each shock and be prepped that it cause somedamage even if we are sure that the plan is in 100% well prepped and containsall tool to decrease the risks. Another conclusion after this exercise is knowledgethat we shouldnâ€™t focused only on one type of component ( knowledge,protection, insurance) even if we can increase one of them on maximum level itâ€™snot good solution - we should find the golden mine of this all areas.The game isvery well designed, the scenario is neutral and nice, the tools for manage riskare simple and well described.

In order for the bar to increase in good time, I had to get the insurance in order to pay less for damage and I had to confront the comets instead of wasting so much time and money on protection. Reading about the comets also helped a great deal because of knowledge increase on a better way to face them.In all I played the game twice.Â The game made me understand the opportunities involved in risk management. Â From it, I was able to understand the importance of taking on risks for example; building of more pods to increase the bar when normally people would not want to do so because they only want to protect the 1 they have which in turn ends up giving them little or no income available for survival.I got to understand the importance of insurance policies. For example, in level 3 I was hit by a comet which caused 53% of damage. Just imagine if I had not gotten an insurance policy that covered 50% of the damage, I would have paid through my nose and definitely not have been able to increase the bar enough to pass the level. It made me understand that the society and government at large are there to help us face these risks.Unfortunately, I did not get pass level 4 due to the many comets attacking the city at once but if I were to have upgraded my city, paid for the 75% insurance policy and used the protection, I'm sure I would have gone 2 levels up.If I had a chance to develop a new version of the game, Â I will put up mote knowledge about the different comets that is when they were most liable to strike in different times of the year and how dangerous they are to the environment. In Nigeria for instance, we are faced with heavy floods and the new one ""Book Haram"" in the Northern sides. A good way to tackle them will be having good knowledge on the type of places they like to attack and putting up top security in these areas (my opinion though).Â Life is all about risks and our ability to confront and turn them into gains makes us able to live through life.Thank you.Â Pamela Bassey-Duke"71.164.77.162,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"In order to succeed at this game, a balanced approach was needed between building a strong set of pods, raising their level, gaining information to know how to react and using insurance to mitigate losses. Â I tended largely towards protection, trying to build a strong infrastructure. Â I used information to try to assess the risk, buying insurance when the risk seemed beyond my ability to fund for it. Â The stronger I was able to build my buildings, and using my connections after being damaged, the better I performed. Â It was also helpful to rebuild as quickly as possible after being hit.The first time I didn't use connections as well as I could have. Â The second time I played the game, I was more aware of this feature and was able to play for a longer period of time. Â Sharing resources with others, and receiving help in return was beneficial. Â I learned that it can sometimes be too late to transfer risk using insurance, but that using connections after the fact can help to make up for the lack of insurance protection. Â Basically, an overall balanced approach worked best.I was a little confused about the source of incoming funds. Â I couldn't tell where they came from or if my method of play impacted funding. Â I think it is important in real life to have a good understanding of what resources are available, what impacts the funding stream and the most effective ways of improving income. Â If I were to make changes to this game, that is the area where I would be most likely to make changes.I may also try to provide a more realistic analogy to the connections portion of the game. Â Moving the cursor from bright start to the next one to light up didn't give me a good feel for what the real life counterpart of this part of the game could be. Â Building strong buildings and seeking insurance coverage made sense to me, as did gaining realistic information about the likelihood and severity of a loss. Â The connections part was not as transparent to me. Â I would try to provide supplemental guidance on this phase of the game so that it becomes as relevant as the other aspects.Overall, the game was a good learning experience. Â It stressed preparation, showed that preparation has a cost, but that lack of preparation can be even more costly. Â It also showed that strengths have to be in place before disaster strikes, there is definitely a penalty for procrastination."99.225.223.98,3.0 to 6.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The role of risk management in the game was to confrontand prepare for risk of potential shocks to pursue developmentopportunities. Â Specifically risk offalling comets that retard, damage and destroy development of the pod community.Â With a careful balance of investments inknowledge, protection and insurance, the community is able to avoid or mitigaterisk of losses and take advantage of opportunities for building more pods.Â  Â Byinvesting in the knowledge available about the chances of the comet hitting,the time until impact as well as the severity of the impact, the community isable to better protect themselves by investing accordingly in theraising of the island to either avoid or mitigate damage and loss to pods.Â  Furthermore, with a balanced and measured investmentin insurance, the community is able to recover and rebuild much more cheaplyand quickly from losses as the resources for rebuilding are covered by insurance.Â  As well as taking advantage of theopportunity to continue development.Â  b.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Trade-offs: Resources are limitedand a balance is sought between investment in Development and RiskManagement.Â  In this case, the ultimategoal is to have healthy development with a balanced risk preparation.Â  Investment in research provided detailedknowledge of probability of impact, time and severity of impact to assess theamount of investment required in protection.Â Knowledge is very useful and quite specific and, therefore, there was atrade-off between knowledge and Protection and between Protection andInsurance. c.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Preparation of risk affecteddevelopment positively as it allowed for the mitigation or even avoidance oflosses.Â  Where losses were unforeseeninsurance reimbursements would allow for cheap and speedy rebuilding forongoing development.Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  I played the game once (computerkept crashing) and found risk management requires a fine balance of investment inknowledge, protection and insurance.Â Initially, I didnâ€™t pay attention to the detail information provided byresearch and quickly realized how very useful it was in the investment to bemade in protection and insurance.I learntfrom the game that one has to pay particular attention to knowledge, protectionand insurance costs â€“ perhaps do a cost-benefit analysis and determine the bestway to proceed.Â  Just as your score wouldimprove in the game if you played it more often, I would expect risk managementto get better as learning and experience is obtained in this area and eventuallya good balance achieved between knowledge, protection and insurance andexperience in making optimal use of resources.Â Risk management is and can be an iterative process such that by monitoring,updating and evaluating knowledge available, ongoing evaluation of investmentin protection and insurance can be made.Â Risk management can be ongoing, realistic and can be better achieved bybuilding foundations.3.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Behavioural bias such as effects ofprocrastination or lobby groups who capture the attention of policymakers.Â  Or perhaps cost-benefit analysistool to determine the effectiveness of the decisions made."99.27.148.126,2.0 to 3.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game is to prepare forpossible terrestrial strikes which could cause drastic damage to thesettlement. At the beginning, I bought a 50% insurance coverage and graduallylift the ground to the pink level. Sometimes, I observed the comets to find outits damage severity and chance of hitting; however, I did not do so frequentlysince I had to spend cash quickly for development and risk management. Mystrategy is to spend a majority of cash on lifting the ground since there willbe no damage if the ground is lifted to the pink level. Another reason is thatthe higher the level, the higher the cost of insurance and repairing. When thecomets hit the settlement, I would have to spend extra cash and time to recoverthe settlement which greatly impeded the development. By lifting the ground inadvance for possible terrestrial strikes, I save a lot by lowering theinsurance cost and eliminating repairing cost. However, focusing on lifting the ground limits the resourcesto spend on insurance and the time to observe the comet. As the game processed,I had to lower the insurance coverage to 33% to save cash. If a comet with hugedamage had hit my settlement, I would have spent tons of cash to recover. SinceI had to constantly hold the button to lift the ground, I had limited toobserve the comets. This exposed my settlement to greater severity and chanceof hitting. The preparation for risk management does affect the development. Onthe negative side, the risk management costs a lot of cash and time. Observingthe comets reduces the time to focus on development and other risk managementoptions. Since cash builds up very fast, not spending appropriate time to spendit on either upgrading or lifting the ground can make you lose the game. Â Although insurance proves to be useful if thecomets hit, it is expensive in the early game. With little cash left afterpurchasing insurance, contacts with comets can leave you no money. Lifting theground extensively gradually drains the money which slows the development rate.On the positive side, the preparation for risk does reduce the damage and help developthe settlementI would slightly adjust my strategy if I could play again.Switching to 33% insurance as soon as I lift the ground close to the pink levelis possibly a better choice. The main thing I learn is that extensivepreparation for risk seems to be a very good strategy to confront risk. Itdramatically lowers the damage and thus reducing the need for insurance andrepairing. I would propose the idea of reducing the benefit of decreasingdamage by lifting the ground. In game, when players lift their ground to thepink level, they incur no damage when the comets hit the settlement. In fact, thereis no perfect prevention in real life. Every risk can cause a certain degree ofdamage. Prevention must combine with knowledge and insurance to produce thebest possible result. In Fort Worth, my current city, I suggest the stategovernment to improve the health insurance rate since it helps more citizenbetter deal with diseases. The healthier the population, the lower the medicalcosts and the better the productivity are. "140.116.101.163,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management is to secure structures built so to have minimum damage when the comet hits. The trick is on cost for resilience versus the damage and the cost of repairing the structure. Insurance comes in as a factor which will take care of damage costs upon the risk occurring. In playing the game, I built the structures, and keep upgrading to keep up it even stronger. For insurance I decided to go for the average premium charge mainly because of the time factor and the funds available. With the time taken to prepare for the risk, development slowed down, the focus was shifted from developing new structures to protecting the two structures I had already built.Playing the game again, I would have to focus also on the comet, understand the potential effects and then be able to judge if my structures would be able to survive with minimum defects. Though the comets have chances of missing, so the resilience costs would be on judged on the available funds and the damage potential of the risk. What I picked as a lesson from the game, is that as much as development is much desired, more attention should be given to protecting already existing structures, there is a time factor attached to it, procrastinating will result to more funds being needed in repairing the structures after the comets have hit.In developing the game, first it would be a clearer description of the research, the time allocated must be clear from the information shown on the comet. The occurrence of the risk is much quicker and gives less time for critical thinking on coming up with the appropriate decision to make, so I would slow it down, give the player enough time to make well thought of decisions, putting the availability of funds in to consideration.

The choices and trade offs were on Research, Protection and Insurance. If the risk of severity was not mitigated taking into considerations the speed of the various comets then the damage would be larger than that could be rebuilt. Also, considering if the Chance of Hit is high than it would be too much of risk not to perform enough Research which could help even after a strike for lesser damage. Also, insurance purchase was a trade off for the resources (money) which could be used for development but then certain level of insurance helps in the long run to mitigate the risk if and when a comet strikes/hits with higher severity and when less research has been done and while the chance of hit are high. This could typically happen if time is not utilized effectively to manage the resources.Preparing for risk did effect development especially in the beginning since more time had to be allotted to mitigate the risk in increasing the protection level. Though resource of time is available most of it would be utilized for risk mitigation and development. But once a certain level of protection was built utilizing the time, there would be possibility of sparing time for development (provided money is available) by closely monitoring the ""severity"" of the incoming comets are not higher than the already set protection.Question 2:If I had played the game only once, I would take care of the speed of the comets and accordingly check the ""Severity"" and ""Chance of hit"" and utilize my resources more effectively. The only thing that I did differently was to utilize the time more effectively in Research and Protection.Â One of the major things I learned from the game was that a lot of time is spent in preparing for risk mitigation and that not much is left for development especially in the beginning. This corroborates well with the developing countries pace of development. Also, a lot of money needs to be spent in risk management which becomes a point to ponder on weather to invest or not especially in the Â beginning.Â Question 3:Towards improving the risk management choices, I imagine that the community could have sectors of different socitial requirements (school, hospitals, public utility centers [water, electricity etc supply] library, community center, entertainment centers, religious centers, residential area, commercial areas etc) Â and development of the community could be on need basis for the present time with some preset conditions. The ""Chance of Hit"" could have additional probability of hitting a certain sector. Accordingly, the choices of Protection and Research as a risk mitigation tools could be used by the player depending on what would be important at that point in time (and the scores of the green bar accordingly increased/decreased).Â "50.90.244.11,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"The game summed up well the concept of risk and how it canbe managed. Given the constant risk (the shock of comets striking) andthe limited resources available (1. money to build pods/protection; 2. timeavailable to build them, say, before the next shock arrives), what I learnt wasthat there indeed is no one best solution, but there are multiple optimalsolutions. For example, an increased focus on protection (raising the city) leftless money for insurance and development; and vice versa. Work a little toomuch on research, and you lose time to protect from and limit the damage. It isabout finding the right balance, which took a little while to understand. Itwas amply clear by the end the exercise that all the four pillars of riskmanagementâ€”knowledge, protection, insurance, copingâ€”are equally important, and thatfocusing on one to the exclusion of others would be incorrect.Preparation for risk, which in this case was to spend sufficient/optimaltime on researching the comet definitely helped in understanding the risklevels. And that meant the following: 1. Sufficient/optimal protection could beensured provided enough resources were available; 2. Getting insurance so that,knowing the impact levels, appropriate measures can be taken to enable lesspainful rebuilding; and 3. More time for making connections, that is, communityrebuilding, is available to help in the process of coping with the impact ofthe shock.I learnt the nuances of the game, and thereby riskmanagement, by playing the game multiple times. The first time I played, I concentrateda little more on building pods (development) and insuring them and researchingthe comets (knowledge/preparation), and paid a little less attention toprotecting the city. Though I managed to get through to the second round, Icould not proceed beyond. After playing the game a few times, each time, inhindsight, concentrating a little less on protection in comparison to otherfactors, because it tended to take away time from risk research(knowledge/preparation for risk), I found that though I was insured well andhad enough time to form connections (coping after shock), I had left the cityvulnerable, and that, with progressing levels, providing greater protectionmeant more time away from preparation and greater costs. As a directconsequence of this learning, I ensured that I raised the protection levels duringthe initial stages, so as to ensure that I could build a certain amount ofresistance to protect from small shocks. That meant there was more time toprepare for worse shocks and ensure insurance and development in the initial,and vital, stage of growth. So, if I were to play the game again, and only once,I would certainly start off by paying a little more attention to ensuring alittle more than basic protection to protect from small shocks, though I do admit,in real-life situations, this might not be always applicable. Each problem is unique,and would require a custom solution, though built on the same four-factorframework of risk management.If I could tweak one thing about this game to ensure it iseven closer to real-life situations would be to introduce an uncertain risk.For example, I would prefer there be a sudden earthquake that could destroy thepods to a certain degree and provide an option of a costlier insurance thatincludes protection from such earthquakes. Participants then can save money/resourcesaccordingly. However, to offset this a bit, I would also ensure, say, greaterplay time or more initial corpus to start with.Â "86.51.162.11,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The game illustrates very graphically how preparation for risk pays off in the long run, even if it may seem costly when things are moving smoothly and shocks are not materializing. Indeed the game exemplifies all four elements of risk management, including the three proactive ones of acquiring knowledge - by scanning the sky for comets and studying them -, building protection - by elevating the surface - and buying insurance - to partly offset eventual property damages -, as well as the reactive one of coping - by moving quickly after disaster has struck -.A few conclusions can be derived from the game, which serve as reflections for real life:- AÂ good combination of knowledge and protection building can effectively avoid the manifestation of damages altogether in a wide range of circumstances, by either ensuring that the threat is known in advance so that specific protocols can be adopted before the shock or by putting protections in place that will avoid or minimize the damage resulting thereof.- In case ofÂ unusually large shocks,Â it may not be financially viable to build matching levels of protection or the early warning system may not give enough time to implement the combination of highÂ knowledge and high protection that would completely eliminate the manifestation of losses. In such cases,Â some degree of insurance may be necessary to mitigate the impact in development of the shock.- Allocation of resources has to be optimized across various risk management elements and with development... developing too fast or investing too much time and money in one particular risk management element may come at the expense of having sufficient funds or time to develop the proper risk management mix.- Running particularly low levels of financial reserves introduces the further risk of not having the flexibility to react to new information and emerging requirements.While I think the game is great in its current format, a possible upgrade could include making a set of specific programs available at each level that the user can selected and invest a certain amount of money on while expecting a return, such as investing X $ in upgrading the knowledge acquisition tools so that knowledge can be gained faster, or implementing special retrofitting program to make pods less prone to damage, etc. Another addition might be the ability to purchase a report providing an estimate of the likelihood of receiving strikes of comets of different intensities in a given year."80.108.71.51,0.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"What was the role of risk management in the game?Risk management was used to mitigate the losses caused by asteroids and to enable the resilient development of a prosperous civilization.

Since the main target was to accumulate a certain level of wealth during a given time, one has to constantly decide on either spending the money on protection or development. It was also possible to get an insurance but this required only one payment upfront. Consequently, it was important to save some money (by foregoing upgrading the facilities) at the end of each level in order to be able to afford an insurance.In what ways did preparation for risk affect developmemt (immediately, or after some time)?The preparation for risk had a significant impact on the damages on the facilites of the developing civilization.

The role of risk management: Multiple trade-offs were required to identify and manage risks, and then cope with the effects of negative events once they occurred. When playing the game, it was difficult to decide how many pods to place around the area. Once placed, insurance was always purchased (to maximum coverage), but the choice of raising the level of the area or instead researching comets (risks) was a difficult one. Raising the area costs money, but also time. Without sufficient time, the pods could not create enough revenue to proceed to the next level.Â This is the same as a community being held back from proper development. Spreading resources or consolidating them, spending time/money on competing resource demands, and balancing saving resources or upgrading existing infrastructure (pods) were questions than made the game difficult. When the community was well connected and well developed, and risks were inusred against, researched and their effects quickly addressed when they occurred, gave the best results.2. Multiple attempts at the game taught me that consolidating resources by upgrading a small number of pods was better for resilience than spreading resources across a larger number of less developed pods. Time and money spent repairing a large number of small pods was better spent maintaining a small number of upgraded pods. Also, when no comets were incoming this time was best spent raising the level of the area to prevent damage. Any time spent raising the area was best not to be at the expense of researching incoming risks. The more time spent researching risks, generally it was seen that the danger level decreased (severity and chance of impact). This indicates that a closer look at potential risk can show that an initial assessment can tend to be more inaccurate.3. Once change that I would make to the game would be to have some comets come in without any warning at all. This would show that some risks cannot be seen until they arrive. However, the same steps that need to be taken for known risks (comets) would always need to be taken. Having this change would just show that even if the horizon appears clear, there is always the chance of a negative impact so there is never any room for complacency. Risk management practices should always be in place, even in times when it appears there is little or no risk in the near future.Â "201.244.51.183,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"Los mÃ©todos de enseÃ±anza, han experimentado un proceso evolutivo conel transcurso de la historia; se logrÃ_ pasar de la catedra magistral a unproceso en donde las herramientas teleinformÃ¡ticas imparten conocimientos y experienciasde tipo virtual que pueden ser aplicadas en la vida cotidiana del ser humano, tomandocomo base lo anterior, los procesos de gestiÃ_n del riesgo no se han quedado atrÃ¡s,a manera de ejemplo pongo a consideraciÃ_n del lector, este anÃ¡lisis crÃ_ticosobre el juego â€œRisk Horizonâ€ù.ALORA, es el nombre del planetaescogido, para personificar las amenazas y vulnerabilidades, que existen en unplaneta similar al que habitamos; dentro de las caracterÃ_sticas mÃ¡ssobresalientes de este planeta, estÃ¡n:Â 1.Â Â Â Apto para la vida y poblamiento del mismo.2.Â Â Â Posee cuerpos de agua, que son la fuente vitalde los ciclos del planeta y de las especies.Â De igual forma el planeta estÃ¡ expuesto a una serie de amenazas delorden natural y antrÃ_pico, a saber:Â 1.Â Â Â Amenazas GeolÃ_gicas: se pueden presentar eventosderivados por la tectÃ_nica de placas, que pueden derivar en Tsunamis.2.Â Â Â  AmenazasastrofÃ_sicas: las cuales se pueden generar por impacto de cuerpo celestes.3.Â Â Â Amenazas del orden antrÃ_pico de tiposocio-organizativo: Este tipo de amenaza se genera cuando la persona quedesarrolla el juego, no tiene clara las funciones y actividades comunitarias dedesarrollo presentes en el juego.Â AsÃ_ mismo, la poblaciÃ_n del planeta ha generado una serie devulnerabilidades, a saber:Â 1.Â Â Â UrbanizaciÃ_n no planificada: teniendo presenteque el proceso de ubicaciÃ_n territorial, se efectuÃ_ sobre las costas delplaneta.2.Â Â Â  Ausenciade informaciÃ_n sobre las amenazas y vulnerabilidades.3.Â Â Â  Altosprecios del suelo y de la vivienda.4.Â Â Â  Altosprecios de las pÃ_lizas de seguro, teniendo presente que los mismos no tienen unmargen de cobertura del 100% sobre el siniestro.5.Â Â Â El tiempo, como factor desestabilizante decualquier proceso de gestiÃ_n del riesgo que se articule con el desarrollosostenible.Â Ahora bien, el jugador personifica la autoridad mÃ¡xima del planeta, elcual tiene la posibilidad de adelantar procesos de desarrollo, alternados conactividades de Conocimiento, reducciÃ_n y manejo del riesgo:Â a)Â Â Â Conocimiento: El juego desarrolla procesos de identificaciÃ_ndel escenario de mayor riesgo, logrando determinar puntualmente, laprobabilidad de impacto de un cuerpo celeste con el planeta asi mismo su grado deseveridad; en este campo el jugador tiene la posibilidad de realizar un anÃ¡lisisde los factores preponderantes de las amenazas, efectuar un monitoreo yseguimiento constante a los asteroides, logrando desarrollar actividades quepermitan comunicar al jugador en tiempo real, los posibles efectos que sepueden derivar.Â b)Â Â Â  ReducciÃ_n:Una vez se determinan las amenazas, el juego permite desarrollar acciones de intervenciÃ_ncorrectivas y/o intervenciÃ_n Prospectiva, con el fin de prevenir eventoscolaterales, al impacto de un cuerpo celeste (tsunami con posterioresinundaciones) y/o mitigar el impacto de estos eventos sobre la poblaciÃ_n delplaneta; de igual forma los procesos de reducciÃ_n permiten afrontar y minimizarlos efectos derivados por las vulnerabilidades, para ello se pueden emplearmecanismos de transferencia del riesgo (seguros) y obras de infraestructura,que garanticen la vida en el planeta.Â c)Â Â Â Manejo: Esta fase del proceso de gestiÃ_n delriesgo, la poblaciÃ_n del planeta realiza actividades de respuesta para unposible evento, tambiÃ©n se adelantan labores de recuperaciÃ_n y rehabilitaciÃ_n ala poblaciÃ_n afectada, logrando recobrar el estado ideal de la sociedad. Â Estas tres etapas, le permiten al jugador efectuar un adecuado procesode desarrollo de la sociedad, alternado con procesos de gestiÃ_n del riesgo quegaranticen la continuidad de la vida, de los negocios y del propio estado.Â Muchas graciasÂ Â Â "190.160.72.38,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The role of Risk Management was fundamental for the developing of the game's community.

In my first attempts I wasn't using correctly the protection sistem, focusing principally in a rapid upgrade of the community, but every time that a big comet arrived I had to restart or pay for a lot of damages. It was pretty fun and it also gave me the possibility to understand how difficult is managing a community or something like this, there's always an obstacle that you have to prepare for.I think that the game represents only the ""noble part"" of risk management, in other words youÂ may lose the game because you didn't managedÂ in a balanced way the mechanisms that you have in your hands, but not because you managedÂ them in a bad way, like happens in the real world.

The different choices that had to be made to achieve this were to raise the island (protection), research the comets approaching so as to minimize severity of their damage (knowledge), or purchase insurance to minimize the amount damage and repair costs when they hit. Raising the island cost money and time, and put development on hold; researching the comets was time-consuming and often took time away from planning or advancing pods; and purchasing insurance cost a significant amount of money that could have been put towards development. All three had an immediate effect in terms of their cost but a later, and usually larger, effect in terms of benefit or pay-off. In regards to choices, only one of the three could be pursued at a time, and the order in which they were pursued greatly impacted development and the playerâ€™s success in advancing to the next level. For example, in some levels it would have been possible to raise the island while you were still approaching the development goal, while in most levels it was only wise to do so after you reached your development goal and had extra savings/green to spare in case a comet hit and damaged your pods. Another choice that often had to be made was level of insurance - if a comet was approaching and likely to hit and damage your island, yet you could only afford the first level of insurance, it was best to purchase it but if you later wanted to upgrade to the highest level, you had to pay the full amount of the highest level, rather than the difference between the level you already had and the new one you were purchasing. Having played the game more than once, the first few times I assumed the best form of risk management would be to raise the island so as to prevent comets from hitting and damaging Alora at all. I didnâ€™t realize how much it cost or how likely some comets were to hit and so I never advanced past the second or third level. After the first few times, the game became more stressful as I learned to appropriately balance the amount of time and money I spent on each of the three resources. Oftentimes, I learned that it would be wisest to purchase insurance first then research the closest comet as much as possible and make sure my developments were in green before I attempted to raise the island - there were a few times when I didnâ€™t even get to raise the island at all during the level.This really helped me understand the concept and possible disadvantages of behavioral biases. If I could change one simple thing about the game, it would be the community connections part. I would make it so it would not only be tied to research, but was instead a general part of the game also somehow tied to protection and insurance. Also, I would try to make it so that it is not all or nothing - for example, I would vary the damage so that not all pods/communities are damaged completely or at all. The game would be too overwhelming if each pod had its own form of insurance, research and/or protection, but it would still be helpful to make the point that not all communities are impacted equally and that not all communities collaborate in the same ways."69.120.162.42,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The aim of the game was to manage environment from certain and/or uncertian risks of pollutions. To advance prepare for possible risks, my first step was getting important knowledge such as the level of shocks, aftermath of potential damage and conditions after than. I tried to build more green areas as much as I could to reduce the level of damage and increase benefits. I clearly saw that much more green areas means much less damage in the game. Regarding to severity and chance of hit, I could estimated potential and have actions to grow our community. After having some shocks, I tried to recover the damaged and boosted protection by building new plots and facilities. Another important fact is cost analysis in the game. After each hit of comets, I needed to spent money to recover the damage. Obviously, if you are not financially secure for risks, you can not protect and rebuild your community. In my first play, I didn't pay attention for insurance plan, therefore it was financialy hard to replace my loss. In next game, I was so carefully when I manage repair cost. To get more benefits, having a really good insurance plan is also very significant as much as having useful knowledge, protection plan and coping plan. I think that another important part is having institutional response to get more advantages and to decrease possible loss. When I moved to higher levels of the games, I noticed having more pods helped me a lot to have more green areas and to mitigate the level of damage. To simplify, I learned from this game that understanding the level of shocks or risks is the first step for risk management. We need to reduce the uncertainty and understand possible outcomes after hitting some devastating events by learning the chance of comet hitting and its impact. The second step is protection that means reducing probability loss and increasing benefits by having more green areas and building or upgrading pods. To change the station from bad to good, we need to have a good insurance plan and use money efficiently to recover damages. In the game, I could practice how to repair and rebuild my pods in cheap way right away.To develop the game, I would put more natural disasters such as earthquake, tsunami or flood. I would also put more options for purchasing coverages besides using money such as some objects or items.

The power of knowledge,insurance and protection from shocks cannot be over emphasized here. Â 1.Â Â Â Â Â The role of Risk ManagementTherole of Risk Management in the game is to protectdevelopment from unavoidable future shocksthat will negatively affect the progress of development; this could be achievedby doing the following:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Provideinsurance to make it easier to recover from any future shocksÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Acquire enoughknowledge and research to help make informed decision Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Provide enough protectionto help insulate against shocksThechoices and trade-offs that I made in terms of knowledge, protection andinsurance are;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Where thechances of the comets hitting is less, development and upgrading still goes on,since the likelihood of suffering from a shock is minimal. This goes on withthe mind-set that there is insurance cover to help make repairs easier should therebe a hit.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Where thechances of hit is high but impact is minimal, development and upgradingcontinue as usual, since the shock will be minimal, I rely on insurance to makerecovery easierÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Purchase ofinsurance is very vital to development; this is because the insurance help toeasily recover from shocks. Higher coverage of insurance per the game, maderecovery less expensive.Preparationfor risk affects development in the future. This is because knowledge aboutrisk, insurance and protection from shocks that hinder development, are donewith the purpose of increasing resilience to possible future shocks.Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â How the Game was playedAfterthe first time of playing the game, I increased the coverage of insurance for subsequenttimes I played the game; I also reduced the rate at which I was developing newplots. The following are the things I learnt from the game:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The wider thecoverage of insurance, the easier and less cost of repairs when shocks hit.Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Increased knowledgereduces the severity of shock, it also helps to make inform decision toinsulate you from the possible future shockÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The moredeveloped a plot is, the higher the cost of repairsÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Development shouldnot be rushed, since unplanned development will end up putting you at a greaterriskÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Well planneddevelopment provide enough protection that makes cooping and recovery easy Â 3.Â Â Â Â Â Proposed changeTheresilience level of each developed plot should be indicated in other to helpmake the player make decisions based on research knowledge with regards to thepossible future shocks. For example people living in a flood prone area shouldbe made aware of how risky it is to live in a flood prone area. Hence the needto either build better drainage systems or build houses that protect them fromthe floods, or move from the area and resettle elsewhere.Â "109.29.244.116,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Learningform the risk management game, risk horizon.The first difficultyI faced was to understand the game works, what thing is doing what. Afterunderstanding each actions possible, you can start to focus on how to managethe risks, and the strategy you want to use. Â As an unexperiencedâ€™s in risk management, Idid the most stupid thing and contrary to all the principles of the course. Iused the main part of my resources to focus on an action. At least thisintuitive action helped me to understand each actions you could take. And thenmore and more I changed my strategy to use all the power at disposition.Â  I started by using a lot of protection,research and then the development.Â Then after a few try and a betterunderstanding of each actions. You understand what all the lessons said so far,those are my feedback from my play:Therole of research, is here to help you to gain knowledge. This knowledge, aboutthe chance of impact, the force of it. Give you the information needed to takethe best or the least bad decisions. It also easy and not too costly to use. Afterknowing the effect and the hinted chance of the comet, you can think about theway to invest your money. If the impact is lower than your protection,you can be considered as safe and invest in development. Ifthe severity, can be managed by improving by one level or maximum two (at the beginning)by protection, the protection is the safest and most durable way to manage thecomet. Ifthe severity cannot be managed by protection, or at a too expensive cost. Theinsurance, would help to mitigate the cost of the damages. But the protectionthat have already been setup, will also help you get a lower damaged cost. Â The game, is really helpful to understand andschematize the different action that can be taken to mitigate the risk. Withonly three factors (protection, research and insurance), and a development tomanage it is tricky to do. And I needed several try, to get a functioning strategyat least until the level 4. In a real situation, the research wouldnâ€™t be soclear, and not so mathematic, you would also have to fight the human factor,and all the obstacles not only the resources obstacles. It does really help toget a first approach of managing the risks for development. "130.204.162.227,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The Risk HorizonGame simulates the three important factors needed for effective risk managementaspects before the shock occurs: knowledge, protection and insurance. The playerhas to balance between them and the development of the city he has to build upand enlarge. The trade-offs between development and risk management costs, aswell as the choice of combination between the research, the increase of theprotection of the city or the amount of coverage as the insurance has to all becalculated and combined in the right way so that the city can advance and beeffective in the risk management against the waves. In the beginning the costwas not as sensitive to the methods applied, so I was able to use the maximuminsurance coverage offered and still spend enough amount of the budget on the developmentof the city, however as the levels advanced, I had to make harder choicesinvolving more trade-offs.Â Â I played the gameseveral times and realized that by being overcautious I did not put enough amounton development, so I realized through trial and error that the optimal choicedoes not mean the best and highest cost of protection, but the most efficientcombination of research, protection and insurance. I started choosing lowerpercentage of coverage and therefore lower insurance price, but focusing moreon the research that was also giving me more means of financing for furtherdevelopment. I personally loved the idea that having better research means moredeveloped city which in real live and country development shows the important roleof education, knowledge and science on the well-being of a country or a nation.and last but not least, I used protection based on the research I did for each cometwhich allowed me to minimize the amount of impact and therefore use lowerprotection level. In terms of building the city, I decided that quality isbetter than quantity and started off with lower amount of buildings, but moreupgrades of their appearance. Then I managed the amount of buildings andupdates based on the resources available and the task I needed to complete. Thegreatest lesson I learnt from the game is that balance is the key todevelopment and risk management and the needs of the country and its resourcesshould determine the ways and the means used to effective risk management andadvancement. The game definitely shows the resilient Â Â relationshipbetween development and risk management. Lastly, the Risk Horizon Game showsthe importance of the relationships between the members of community to copewith the common threat. Being united and living in community is what help ussurvive and develop. Amongstthese lessons, in my opinion, the game may suggest othermeans of protection to be used over longer term horizon. For example, inBulgaria, the place where I live, we experience floods and other naturaldisasters relatively rarely, so the state and the population tend tounderestimate the risks and the problems. The institutions also tend topostpone the obvious risk management policies to keep in cleaner state thechannels and the drainage systems in the cities. This problem, addressed in thevideo talks and the report as well, shows the importance of the long termhorizon investment in risk management. That is why, in my opinion, the gamewould be a bit more realistic and challenging if it offers a forth tool thatwould be a longer-term protection policy against the waves or more severenatural disasters that happen once in several levels but need aÂ  bit more different policy. Â Â Â "110.175.228.187,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of the risk management in the gamewas to evaluate all the possible risks and find out a solution by using the components that we have seen thisweek.A general valuation must be done on all the factors present in the game: natural calamity, development times, protection, research and insurance.The first time that I played, I focused myselfon the construction so I built as much I could, when I lost the first time I realized that I needed also to protect everything with a correct insurance that could help in case of disaster.When I lost again I decided to focus my attention also onthe research.So I started again with another idea on mymind and I focused on the three components of the risk management.During the game I decided to focus my attention on the research in order to try to reduce losses.Â Knowledge can help people to understand the nature of the risks and can help to decidehow to act and in the game was possible to see how the research could change the negative effects of the meteor impact. As we have seen in the game development and research run together. We need to be prepared so we need to invest time and money on the research and than with the obtained results we can start thinking about how to plan the development. Research, information and knowledge are useful but not sufficient. In this case the impact was inevitable even if we had all the information about that so the next step was to analyze theright insurance and a good protection.I decided to pay 1 dollar every time to cover the possible losses and in this way added more protection to my project.Â Protection includes any action to preventnegative shocks and it can be self-provided, purchased from the market orprovided publicly. But protection cannot completely eliminate therisk so in this case the insurance could help to reduce the negatives effects ofthe shock.One thing that I have done in the gamewas to buy an insurance for all my buildings in order to be covered and be helpedin case of damages. Insurance allows to be covered for something that could happen but we are not sure about that, and with this cover we are induced to invest more time and money on a project. With the right cover we can restart after a disaster without spending a lot of the resources we have so we can focalize again on the project and continue the development.On one hand I realized that be ready and know risks allow to act in order to protect and defend the development done at the time but on the other hand I also understood that, as well as in this game and also in the reality, the risks sometimes are evident but theamount of the losses are unpredictable. The only thing that we can do is be prepared and organized in order to prevent damages as long is it possible and reduce the negative effects. For this reason risk management plays an important role. Knowledge, protection and insurance are components that we need to consider every time that we want to talk about development as well as Incentives, information, behaviors and resources.

In the video lectures we have learnt that the benefits of risk management exceed the costs of it. So I thought the best would be to invest in protection. That was an epic fail. I didn't notice this little entry in the FAQ ""Whenever you are protecting, your pods are not developing. This is something you must keep in mind when you are attemtping to balance preparing for comets and reaching your goal before time runs out.""So one trade-off is certainly to protect your village and develope it in the same time. I invested too much money in insurances at the beginning. I invested too much in research and protection. I was kind of over-protected (the money for the insurance was wasted, I chose the 75% one).An other trade-off consists of the way you would like to build your village. What is better, buildung lots of pods or upgrading them? I tried both possibilities many times, but I only achieved level 3. One main issue was the little implemented game before the wave hits the village. Although I invested in research, it didn't help me to protect and save the village. I first played the game on my notebook, but it is quiteÂ difficult to play with the touchpad and hit all the yellow glows in this short time.So I switched my computer and used a mouse. I changed my strategy. I invested in insurance, but only 33 per cent, otherwise theÂ incentive not to build protection would be to high. This insurance was cheap, so I had enough money to develope my village. I built lots of pods instead of building one and only upgrading this one building. I think that money can't buy you development in this game if it is on your bank account. So I invested it as fast as I could. And the mouse did help me to get more protection for my village. An other problem I faced was the fact that I find it difficult to protect againtst big comets at level 2, especially if they hit you at the end of the game, so you lose your developement, because you don't have enough time to rebuild the village.I don't like the minigame. In my opinion it destroys the good idea ofÂ strategic risk management. It really is a game when you have to click dots. I don't like how the research works in the game (observation of comets equals research???) I would replace this system by a research buildung, where you can invest money and get predictions like ""In 30 sec a comet (4 bars +/- 2) will hit you. The +/- should depend on the level of that buildung.My little brother (10 year-old) played the game just for fun. And yeah, he achieved level 5. He didn't watch the videos of this course. I guess he knows how to use the mouse.Â Nevertheless I would be interested in a walkthrough of the game. Could you upload it after the deadline?PSÂ I apologize for any spelling errors in advance.

Through research - which improved the time to establishlinkage with communities to minimise the impact of meteorites that struck,securing insurance, and protection, risk management helped to eliminate or significantlyreduce the impact of meteorites that struck and offered the opportunity forfurther development in subsequent stages of the game. Throughoutthe game, I made trade-off to help progress to the next stage. Notable amongthem were situations where I sacrificed developing pots to secure insurance and/orprotection. During other stages of the game, I spent more time researchingmeteors in other to secure ample time for establishing linkage with othercommunities to diversify risk and minimise shocks associate with meteorites thestroke.Initially,preparation for risk drained available resources (capital) and hence led toslow development. In the long-term however, adequate preparation served as agreat platform to propel the channelling of resources into developing pods.Inplaying the game the third and fourth times, I channelled more resources intoresearching and protecting my developments and it really paid off compared withthe first time where most of my resources were channelled into developing thepods. It became so decipherable to me from the game that, research andtherefore knowledge acquisition is very important in risk management as it isthe foundation upon which choices can be made regarding the channelling ofresources into insurance or development. I readily came to comprehend whycountries like Japan even in the challenge of all the risks they are exposed to,are more developed than a country like Ghana - that is well endowed withnatural resources and more so, exposed to relatively fewer and less devastatingsystemic risks.In Ghana,citizens are posed with financial crisis notably, the depreciation of the Ghanacedis due to considerably high import of goods and service. However,individuals are at the risk of losing family breadwinners to diseases (hypertension,malaria, HIV/AIDS or hepatitis B), accidents and even death (GHS, 2007). Loss ofjobs specifically in the mining sector is also a common occurrence (TheChronicle, 2014). On the other hand, Japan, is susceptible to volcanoes,tsunami and earthquakes (Science Channel, 2013). This greatly constrain theirallocation of resources for risk management and development. Whereas research ishelping in forecasting the occurrence of these impending dooms that loom large,in other citizens prepare for the inevitable, other risks notably accidents,and sometimes death are unpredictable.By designingsome pots in the game to be susceptible to liquefaction and sinking, decisionregarding the use of resources can better represent idiosyncratic risks (losinga job, falling victim to a crime or a disease) in the game. Moreover, by makingthe ground for development susceptible to flooding in addition to the fallingmeteorites, the systemic risks associated with countries notably Japan, Haiti,among others could be best depicted in the game. It is worth knowing that thesecountries have to make trade-off in the use of their resources in preparing forone risk or the other.Inconclusion, the game has provided more insight on the role of risk managementin preventing damages that could retard development whiles offering diversityin the learning approach to this course.ReferencesGhanaHealth Service (GHS) (2007).

I can see howthis relates to cases like big hurricanes (Haiti) where even if preparation andinsurance were available, the amount of shock produced would rend theinfrastructures almost to nothing.As the planet increases the amount of pods and itsdevelopment, the risks are higher and higher because the destruction a cometwould bring at those stages would create another effect: a set-back so the level of progress that society had would be sentback in time making the conditions of that social system go in a regression.I played the game many times each time improving and reachinghigher levels, as I played more, the experience from previous games helped me madebetter strategic decisions and I would value the importance of each area: research,development, insurance and protection as well as wealth generation, if I wereto do some changes to the game, I would include a warning system that tells youwhen the level of protection is way lower than the expected severity of thecomet above level 4 and as the research gets deeper, so the protection measurescan be better prepared to establish a safezone where you can reach a steady growth.No doubt progress and set-backs belong to the road ofsocietiesâ€™ evolution and as members of them we have the tools to improve andprogress which can be the case of new forms of energy or understanding climatechange and natural disasters for increased prevention, but also we have theresponsibility of halting the set-backs we also create in war, pollution andabuse of natural resources.The name of Risk Horizon appeals to the reality of things inenvironments with risks, as you can never stop preparing, because the riskschange and what helped in the past might not work in the present, the weatheris not constant and thereforeÂ  a riskmanagement plan for it has to be adaptable, predictions can be made, that wouldbe the base of research and analysis (studying the comets), improvements ininfrastructure, systems, plans and actions would reduce the impact or eveneliminate some risks at all ( vaccination or water sanitation) but thereremains also another truth: as in the game where you keep an eye on the horizonfor risks you should also keep an eye on the horizon for new options, inanalyzing the comets, the people from Alora could discover another world thatwould enable them to shift their civilization there once Alora would no longerhave the conditions to sustain their society. David Barrantes Hernandez"84.20.224.242,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"This game is a possible simulation of risk management in the development context. Comets represent risks, because there is a possibility of loss. Their basic characteristics are impact (severity) and likelihood. Moreover, those risks are measurable but implications are uncertain. Confronting comets means possibility of damage to our development, so you try to prepare for them (research; knowledge), get insurance, and later cope with effects. So, this game brings together basic characteristics of risk management and tries to simulate how to prepare, confront and cope with risk.Â When I played this game I had to make choices on how to balance between growth and coping with risks, how much to pay for incurance, how much time to spend on research and on which comets, and how to protect. My strategy was to get insurance, try to spend as much time on research as possible, protect agains the ""waves"", and in the meaintime grow my community. However, similar as in the real life, risks are uncertain, and sometimes loss is bigger than expected. Protection in this game help me to become resilient - to faster recover from negative shocks - sometimes immediatelyor in the next level. Thus, good protection was an important part of achieving better development.After playing this game more times (I reached level 4), I spent more time on research as I found out this helped me to better prepare and cope with effects of damage. What is more, when I played this game first, I tried to grow my community as fast as possible, but after playing it more times, I upgraded my slots slower as I paid more attention to managing risk and balance growth as this helped me to develop my community in a more predicted way. All in all, I learned, in a simplifed way, why knowledge, protection, and insurance are important. This elements help us to manage negative shocks; prepare and cope with shocks.Â In a new version of this game, I would recommend to include different kind risks. I would not make this game more difficult but add some more risks as this would make this game more realistic. Those risks could be risks of drought if there is no rain, risk of disease, or risk of floods (these are also risks we face in our ocuntry). Regarding gamelaplay, it would also help us to continue game from the level we reach instead of playing it from the beginning. As I understand, the aim is that you like playing this game, so this small change would add to better gameplay.Â "76.76.188.248,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-63.0 to -36.0,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,11.0 to 46.0,"Risk management's role inÂ the city of Alora was to help reduce the developing city's vulnerability by implementing the measures needed to make Alora more resilient while it develops to its full potential.Â  As the city grew the more protection and insurance it needed.Â  Now that came at a cost.Â  The trade off was while in the process of acquiring knowledge about the risk, you would be confronted with gaining the right amount of protection and insurance which at the same time would put research and development on a halt, and all three came at a cost whether it be financial or time wise.Â Â Preparing for risk affected the development process in thatÂ  (1) preparation came at a cost and as a result sometimes there was not enough money and time between the hazards to continue with developing the city.Â  (2) As the risk increased so did the cost of development and risk management. Played this game more than once.Â  What was done differently was that the city was not developed too quickly, more time was spent on research, and acquired the best insurance from onset.What was learnt from this game was (1) knowledge is key, yet you need to balance when is the rightÂ  time to do so without risking too much (2) each hit from the hazard decreased your protection and cost you time and money to rebuild (3) time and cost is a factor in research, development, protection and insurance (4) the frequency between events left the city vulnerable,Â it limited the time needed to do research, acquire protection evenÂ whenÂ insurance with the best coverage wasÂ purchased, or develop at the rate one desired.Â  Too much of a rapid development hindered time and money to acquiring knowledge.Â  Sometimes concentrating on one factor such as protection, lost time and money and did not give enough timeÂ to gather the knowledge about the hazard, which still left the city vulnerable.Â Â In the end there must be enough time and money for development and risk management.Â  There is no perfect balance between risk management and effects of the risk.Â Â However, having implemented allÂ factors of risk management decreases the effects of the hazard.Â  Yet having frequent hazards increases your vulnerability because you have not had enough time or funds available to strengthen your resilience from the lastÂ  event.Â  So why risk management when even though the city implements all factors of risk management, it is still leftÂ picking up the pieces especially ifÂ the frequency of the hazards are so close together?Â  Money, having some is better than having none at all.Â  Insurance will cover at least 75% of rehabilitation.Â  When residents of the city see that policies were put in place, development shows progress towards restoration, it fortifies the residents, gives them hope and most times will encourage majority (not all) at least those who can afford to, to learn and build their own resilience.Â  But what about the poor and vulnerable who cannot affordÂ insurance and the vulnerable areas?Â  Risk management -Â  if the research is done properly, then the city should know where the first places to implement the mitigation measures.What to change about the game, nothing because it is a game not reality,Â  but as a platformÂ in showcasing risk management, then add people, because people bring dynamics."80.76.163.245,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 36.0,17.0 to 30.0,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,11.0 to 46.0,"This game really shows that an optimal adjustment of choosing which tool to use, to what extent and when, defines how successful the risk management can prove on the long term. The anticipation, the energy deployed to achieve a level of protection high enough to go through the comet waves safely, all the steps taken timely are defined through the same logic that was introduced as key elements of Risk Management. Preparation is here materialised into Knowledge acquired from studying the comets while they cross the sky, Protection is gained from the height the platform is raised, and Insurance is applicable to the environment built, proportionally to the installations developed. Then, Coping is illustrated by the post-impact actions available : recovering thanks to Insurance benefits, and obviously repairing the damaged pods.Technically, with comets falling from the sky, managing the risk taken by the community does not allow for a second chance. I needed it though, and a trial and error approach was indeed pretty efficient in order to reach a perfect management.The metaphor of this little piece of land constantly bombed is quite accurate: being too greedy, building all possible pods without investing in upgrading them will show inefficient. Being excessively protective, raising the level of your land too fast, will leave you with no money, and not enough power to reach your goal.At the same time, not defending against the comets will result in too much damage that even the insurance will fail to protect.At last, spending some precious time on research might lower the risk, both its occurrence and its importance.If I had to re-develop the game, I would add variety in the risk encountered, so that the player would have to adapt in-game. The recurrent risk of falling comets make them fall into two categories only: those that will hit and generate damage, and those that won't, being too unlikely to hit or too weak to affect the community. Therefore, a routine sets up: the response is systematic and is influenced only by the efficiency of the player to reach the milestones of security timely (building enough upgraded pods fast enough to pass the levels, raising the level high enough). The beauty of a real-life situation is the variety of risks that impose different responses to be properly prepared. For that matter, strategies fit to anticipate a risk might be counter-productive when applied to another risk. It is once again the knowledge of the nature, frequency and impact of each risk that will determine the appropriate protection to develop. It is to be noted that readiness to face a risk can also be efficient when applied to another, and it is the synergy of actions that will reveal sustainable on the large scale of Risk Management. Hence, I would definitely instigate that notion into the framework of the game, for instance through a tough compromise: isolating from the waves by raising the platform up would bring the community out of range of a capital resource (like food from fishing, for instance) and a seasonal arrangement would have to be understood by the player in order to deal with both needs."188.123.231.11,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"First of all, let me say that this game is a very good way to learn aÂ cost-effectiveness calculation, whichÂ estimates of the likely costs and benefits of risk management.Â 1) The role of risk management in this game is protectingbasic livelihood (pods) in thegiven territory (Alora) aswell as promoting risk taking (by developing livelihood and makingchoices). There are alsomany direct and indirect risks-sharing mechanisms. These include: self-insurance atthe state level, market-based tools (such as hedging and insurance instruments,income associated with foreign assets, external borrowing from internationalmarkets, and current account adjustments1), international labor mobility (suchas through immigration and emigration), implicit hedges provided bymacroeconomic flexibility, and transfers and access to credit frominternational financial institutions (IFIs), and bilateral swap arrangements[1].Thus, for example, I preferred to buyinsurance as soon as possible as well as to make a deep research. After sometime of course extensive preparation affected the development.Â 2) Effectiverisk management can provide both resilience to withstand adverse events and theability to take advantage of development opportunities. Thus effective riskmanagement consists of combining the capacity to prepare for risk with theability to cope afterwards, while pitting the upfront cost of preparationagainst the probable benefit.Â A strong risk management strategy consistsof four components: knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping. Even though from the first time I played the game Ihave reached 5th level, I couldnâ€™t reach the next level even when Iplayed it second time. I believe that my main disadvantage was the lack ofdevelopment as a result of not taking risks. I have mainly put my efforts intothe preparation process. If I were to play again, I would try to put moreefforts into development in order to effectively manage the risk.Â Â 3) Facing risk anduncertainty is one of the most difficult challenges for individÂ_uals,households, communities and countries. Global financial crises, civil conflict,crime and criminal violence, climate change and natural disasters, infectiousdiseases, and volatile food prices are only a few of the many events andprocesses that can deepen the sense of insecurity in todayâ€™s rapidly changingand globally integrated socio-economic environment. Therefore, I would proposeto make more real connected with a real risks which country may face or riskswhich can affect individuals.[1]Managing Risk for Development: InternationalRisk Sharing by Joshua Aizenmanand Ä°nci Ã–tker-Robe, June 26, 2013 http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNWDR2013/Resources/8258024-1352909193861/8936935-1356011448215/8986901-1380568255405/WDR14_bp_International_Risk_Sharing_Aizenman.pdf"96.243.209.140,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"Â Â Â Â  In the game, the roleof risk management was to demonstrate how risk management operates in the risk chain.The player had to prepare and cope with shocks to their community and cope. Â To do this, the Luminator had to decide what tobalance preparation for the potential shock of a comet strike and ensuingtsunami with development of the community of Alora. Preparations for Alora includedresearching comets (knowledge), purchasing insurance, or raising the elevationof the community (protection). The better the preparation directly correlatedwith how well you would be able to cope with a comet strike and continuegrowing.Â Â Â  Â Every choice had different results on Aloraâ€™s development.Research cost money, but impact on development didnâ€™t help until the communitynetwork was mobilized after the comet strike. Insurance was costly and showresults unless the community suffered damage, but then the speed and cost ofreplacement was based on the amount purchased. Finally, the option I relied onmost, was raising the elevation of the community. I found that raising thecommunity to an appropriate height provide the best protection most of the time.However, this was enhanced by having minimal insurance and decent money reservesto prevent absolute destruction.Â Â Â Â  While I made itto level six my first try, and lost, I still tried several different scenarios.Â First I balancing everything to almostexacting standards, which required a lot of monitoring and quick movementspost-shocks. To see if that was the best method I tried other developmentstrategies, tis included buying maximum insurance, building the communityslowly in waves or all at once, and raising the community to the safest point. Focusingeverything on one aspect was never as successful as the first attempt. Ilearned that it is very difficult to get everything perfectly balanced, and asthe reading mentioned, you canâ€™t expect to protect from all shocks.Â Â Â Â  A change that Iwould make to the game would be to add a meter that tracks the populationâ€™ssatisfaction with the Luminator. During the game one of the comments betweenlevels was that the citizens of Alora enjoyed seeing constant construction. Ibelieve this satisfaction meter would simulate the political considerations apolitician must face from their constituency when wanting to stay in office andcould likely affect decisions the Luniminator would make take in order to keepthe population appeased, a reality faced by governments making risk managementdecisions."201.81.114.110,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"Playing the game Risk Horizon is a revelation on many levels. First important realisation comes from the fact that it is nearly impossible to progress far, respectively it costs a good deal of effort, when you try to play for the first time not precisely knowing the rules. Already at the beginning I confirmed one of the pitfalls of human mind that was discussed in one of the lectures before - overconfidence. To start with, I eyeballed the rules and logic, and set to play. However, as the game picks up momentum, the pressure comes in, and it is nearly impossible to keep up for more than three levels before you are crushed by failing economy of your small Pod State.The whole (very simplistic) model first shows perfectly well how important information is and how one decision (say, investment into insurance, or an economy-growing pod) influences outcomes in the future. You need both, that is for sure - pods and insurance, one for now, to have the powerhouse of economy steaming on, the other for the future. But it is the classical of the problems of running a economy - do we invest now into something that has an immediate effect, or into something that will/might materialise only in the future. It makes me smile a little to realise how difficult we would make the game by adding one more variable - corruption. That would eat from our ability to predict, delegate resolutions, and the power of the economy.Another interesting thing is finding the balance between self-defence and insurance. I am pretty convinced that there is a great variety of people that do not know exactly how to find the equilibrium - they on one side might purchase the most expensive insurance and leave the rest to chance, sometimes that works for them, sometimes it does not. Others might think investing into insurance is a decent bag of money, I better invest it into something that will give me more return and bit by bit build my own resilience to disasters (which might end up being the most expensive option). Others go the middle way. One way or another, an important revelation is that during a lifetime, people, families, companies, states, or countries eventually will get hit and there will be damage, regardless of the preparations, planning, executive work, or insurance. I think that when you invest a great deal of effort into risk management, in the corner of your mind you hope that as a result, any damages must as a function be entirely avoided. But they most likely will not and the resulting psychological suffering moves individuals to desperate states, from which it might be very difficult to come back.I believe that after the waters calm down, like in the times of tribes, communities should be part of a feedback sessions to see what went wrong, what could be done better next time, and to be shown in a simple way how their common action helped to keep the territory afloat as much as it was possible. From a reflection upon this they should get a feeling that preparations do make sense, and also a better access to those, who crucially have the most responsibility (or avoid responsibility) within their community, or country, for that matter. In the long run, it is a case of making decision makers accountable directly to their people. I am now living in a South American country and REAL accountability is what here no one seems to be assigned. And it is not difficult to tell. Sweet words, no change."190.156.199.34,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The choice I made was to establish and Â sustain a connection between the powers given: research, protection and insurance.

What I would propose could be a different scenery; something more realistic according to the situation of violence or droughts living in these days in my country , that allows people to think about behaviors of community, resorces we have to cope with that situation, information given by the government and obtaining by the people to understand the proper way to face it. Â  Â I think the idea of activities like the game is to learn how in differents situations someone is responsible for the decision made considering the cost benefit analysis, it menas doing a quantitative analysis of the cost of mitigation of the risk and balancing it with the benefits of the measures taken.

It is important to take certain step to reduce the impact of risk. In the real world this could translate to saving lives, preventing a crisis or unleashing an opportunity that would not have been realized. Preparing:Thinking through a strategy, keeping my eyes on the horizon as well as investing time in research helped me advance to higher levels. Risk preparation should be holistic. Focusing on one aspectÂ  e.g.buying insurance may notÂ  fully insulate one from the impact of the crisis at hand.Coping: Once hit by a comet, it was important to do repairs. This helped the community to suffer less damage caused by subsequent comets.The choices and trade-offs were first to ensure that I was applying the information provided at the beginning of the game. I also found it useful apply learning from the discussion forum which helped me propel myself to level four. Second was to place greater emphasis on research which helped me analyze the severity of the comets as well as the chances of being hit. I tried as much as possible to ensure that the level of protection matched the severity level especially where there was a high chance of the comet hitting the pods. Thirdly, I realized the need to balance advancing development against investing in protection or insurance i.e. developing new pods vs upgrading the current one.Â  The maximum amount of insurance did not always pay off and it was better to save the resources to use in other areas. Although preparation for risk was an intense and sometimes costly exercise, it helped develop a more resilient community overtime. Q2: I did play the game more than once and the main things I learnt that helped me do things differently where:Keep your eyes on the horizon: It was the rather obvious thing to do but not always the easiest with a number of things to monitor.Research: This I could not emphasize enough. It helped me make informed decisions on how much emphasize to place on protection and insurance. It also helped buy time.Community: It helped to work with the community to reduce the impact of risk. After while it became difficult to monitor all tools and therefore it helps for risk management to be a collective effort.Indicators: It was useful to have the light on the left as an indicator of whether i would achieve the level. Monitoring and profiling risk is key particularly where there is high risk high impact this would require better management.Knowledge is power and cannot be neglected. Preparation will go a long way in managing risk.Â Q3: If I was to develop a better version of the game, i would include the following:The ability to move from one level to the next without having to start all over again. In some instances it was caused by a 'fatal error;Clearer feedback at the end of each round. I was not clear what exactly I was doing wrong.I would design a different format of inputting some of the choices similar to the insurance one so that one is clearer about the choices they are making."82.198.202.10,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,12.0 to 37.0,n/a,"1.	The role of risk management in this game is to balance the amount of effort (money) invested into development, protection and research for the successful growth of a community. By investing in the community development, which in turn increased the economic return, one had to an also invests in protection to reduce the propensity of a crisis, by avoiding negative impacts from the shock (the Asteroid hitting Earth). Whenever time was not enough to cover building protection, then insurance was a wise investment, which could reduce the amount needed to cover the damages, thus allowing you to keep developing at a constant speed, instead of spending large amounts in repair. Preparing for risk as investing on protection took some time and resources away from investment in development. Preparation was in the end the best type of investment to avoid the risk not only in response to the direct threat. It had to be done ahead of time, as sometimes a high-risk of impact and highly damaging meteor could come very fast. Therefore preparation ahead of time was necessary and it was the biggest differential factor, more than insurance, 2.	I played the game several times and once I realized that the trick was to invest in protection to avoid damages from meteors, I did not spend any resources on insurance and had more available to further the development and upgrading of the community. I learned that time is precious when you invest in protection, you do not have the time to invest in the development of the community. One has to choose carefully where the community needs the most support according to the needs, imediate and future Balancing the amount invested in insurance, development and protection was the trick to reach the fifth level of the game. Research also helped, but whenever the development was being accomplished, in accordance to time. Whenever the minimum time limit was on red, meaning development was not taking place as it should, barely any efforts were given to research, a  commonly found in real life as well.WHen I was in Level 5, I was doing very well with a fully functioning upgraded community, but realized to late the protection from the asterois and tidal waves had gone down after a few minor hits and  a highly damaging Asteroid came. I had been investing too much in development and forgot to insure a highly developed community. The damages were catastrophic and I had to spend all my resources in repairing the community.3.	One major change I would propose is to turn the theme of this game into a farming/rainfall insurance game.The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter where I live would not make much sense to me now. However, I do work with Africa a lot in wastewater treatment and reuse as fertigation for areas with lack of rain and groundwater. I would like to see a game like this in respect to the effect that rainfall insurance cause in India though. I am not entirely clear on how it works. The fact that farmers can pay the insurance when there are crops producing is understandable. However, if it does not rain, and the farmer does not have any product to sell, how could he have had afforded the insurance in the first place? Therefore, I would substitute the pods for crops and the asterois for droughts to see how this system is working.  Is it true that farmers only get their security insurance payments in case of no rain and he has produced no crops?

It was a quite difficult game, Ihave to play it twice to reach fourth level. The most important thing in thegame was to balance money spending between development (building or upgradingbuildings) and securing (terrain lifting and insurance).Riskmanagement is very important in the game. Without proper precautions you couldlost all your buildings â€“ cost of repairs could be so high, you wouldnâ€™t get tothe goal before time. The best way to win in my opinion was to avoid danger(lift terrain so high, that the comet wouldnâ€™t cause damage). But from theother hand concentrating too much on avoiding danger resulted in poordevelopment and lack of resources â€“ that was the reason why I had to start agame for second time. But results of mistakes made in early levels was visiblelong time after â€“ it was hard to value if decisions Iâ€™ve made was right or not.In thesecond run I concentrated more on development, and secure only slight above theminimum level that was required. I also did not put so much money intoinsurance â€“ damage caused by comet was so severe, it did not allow to continuegame on further levels (due to time of fixing) â€“ so it was no sense to spendmoney on it. The main thing I learned is the right balance in money spending.I wouldshorten time of building fixes â€“ on higher levels you are not able to win afterbeing hit, even when you have the highest insurance, due to this time. In reallife you can split production and not keep all resources in one place â€“ itmight increase the cost of business, but allow you to continue production evenin occurrence of disaster â€“ you lose only part of your power. This gameunfortunately lacks in this â€“ when you are hit all buildings are damaged. If Iworked with developers I would introduce sort of production splitting. Thisgame is a simple model, but I think is a bit to simple â€“ in real life you haveto face many treats, with different impact factors and probabilities. In gameyou have only one threat (but with different factors and probabilities) andalso one way to protect. This model Is to simple, and I thing in further levelsother kind of danger and protection should occur.In generalgame is very good â€“ it shows in simple way practical issues connected with riskmanagement, and proves that the best way to learn is to play."192.86.100.203,2.0 to 3.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"QUESTION 1: In this game, the objective is to meet theAlora community development goals by building and upgrading pods. Â Riskmanagement involves confronting, preparing for and coping with risks.Â  Players confront risks by observing meteors and researching their level of severity, probability of hitting andtime toÂ impact. Â They prepare for them by boosting their protectionor purchasing insurance, and they cope with their effects by making connections in the aftermath of a shock and repairing pods. Â As I playedthe game, I found that I had to make trade offs between my development goalsand managing risks. Â For instance, if I didn't adequately protect againstrisks, I would suffer losses that would set back my develop. Â However, ifI over-insured, , I would have fewer resources to spend on development.Â Finding the right balance between opportunity and risk was key to asuccessful outcome (i.e. winning a level). Â To achieve the right balance,I employed a strategy of ensuring that I had at least a basic level ofinsurance as soon as the meteors started coming, and thatIÂ checkedÂ on theÂ predicted severity of the meteors as soon asthey came into full view but were still a little ways out. Â This gave metime to increase my level of protection to match the severity of theworstÂ incoming meteorÂ if I needed to. Â Using this strategy, Iexperienced no damage in most cases.Â QUESTION 2: I was able to successfully complete up toLevel 4 of the game, but lost Level 5. Â From this I learned that mystrategy of focusing on a mix of insurance and protection was not enough.Â I needed to place greater emphasis on knowledge/research and communityconnections to continue to develop successfully as development progressedbecause the cost of insurance and protection were increasing at a rate that Icouldnâ€™t afford if I pursued my previous strategy. Â And, the cost of repairsto pods was also increasing, which also put back development considerably whena meteor hit.Â  This led me to the insightthat successful risk management strategies in the past don't necessarily workas development progresses. The appropriate balanceofÂ knowledge,Â protectionÂ and insurance will change over time. Â QUESTION 3: One issue where I live concerns theconstruction of a pipeline across land and an increase in oil tankerscollecting oil delivered by the pipeline. Â The pipeline could break, causing an oilspill in the area of the breakage with severe negative outcomes for people and wildlife. Â Similarly, the oil tankers could runaground and spill out in the sea over a vast territory, again with negativeoutcomes. Â Despite the risks, the pipeline and oil tankers are likely tobring significant economic benefit to the region. Â Though the benefits of the pipeline and oil tankers will begreat, they will not be evenly distributed - jobs are likely to benefit a fewin a specific sector and to be short-term while a spill would affect many for a long time. To have playersof the Risk Horizon game reflect on the realities where I live, I suggest asubsequent level of the game could be structured so that the gameâ€™s incentivestructure changes. Â In this round, the goal could shift so that playersare rewarded for meeting their own (or an organizationâ€™s) financial targets,(e.g. Pod Construction Corp. only), but not the development of the community asa whole. Â Players could then be asked to reflect upon how their behaviourschanged in this round and to observe what effect this had on the community as awhole.

What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?Risk management played a key element in being successful (scoring your goal) in this particular game. Having been given the hints of building and up-grading, I made the choice of continually improving the island.Knowing that a meteor could strike at any time, there was plenty of incentive to both insure the property and improve the height of the land.There is always an initial balance between spending for development, accumulating wealth versus insuring the property. However, when a disaster strikes, without insurance, along with the devastation of property,  also included is financial ruin.If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?The one thing I would do differently, would be to develop the property at a more accelerated rate.The main points appeared to be to develop the property quickly and insure your property to the proper level.The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?I would not allow the player to change the elevation of their property, thereby putting more at risk during the disasters."50.167.225.37,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management played the most important role in the development of Alora world. There was no way the illuminator would have achieved the milestones set along the way without risk management. In managing knowledge, protection, and insurance, She was able to increase the rate of development, hence raising the bar.To achieve this, one had to balance the delicate act of growing the community and preparing for the potential threats. The use of research was paramount in guiding the type and amount of development. Research provided the information on the probability and intensity of the hazards, and in turn gave an indication of how much insurance was needed. Many are the times that one had to spend more time on research at the expense of development -reason being that there was no point in investing heavily on what could be at risk without proper insurance. By doing research and predicting what was coming/what was known, one was able to pick the right insurance, hence cushioning the needed development.Community protection offered the last layer of protection against the intensity of threats. Risk management in the long run was responsible for the vibrant development experienced in Alora. Each of the four components of good risk management was costly in terms of money or time, but failure to manage would have had dire consequences.(Remember the Oh No! expressions that escaped your mouth every time your ponds were destroyed by the comets, and you didn't have enough insurance, and you had to start all over again--the frustrations!) To pursue opportunity, in this case development, one had to confront risk.2- Â  In playing this Â game, I learned the importance of keeping a balance between research/knowledge, insurance, and protection. All these components are essential in managing risk and creating opportunities.3- I would probably want to represent some of the choices that people faced by these threats have to make when buying Insurance. It is not just a matter of how much you want to get but whether you can afford it. These are choices faced by many people not only in the developing world but the developed world as well.Secondly, I would incorporate Â coping as a component of good risk management. I feel that this component was not well exemplified catered for in this game.

Risk management is essential to minimize the potential adverse impact and keep the plan (business/devleopment) on track. It also saves resources for other purpose (investment/development). My choice in the game was to identify and analyze risks as much as I can through broadening knowledge. Based on the information I have, I can select choice that have risks, and utilize mechanims or tool to deal with that risks such as buying insurance or building protection. Preparation for risks affect development in a number of ways. First, it can shape the direction of development in a way that involve fewer risks. In pratice, this can be in the form of resilient growth or development because if shocks materialize, the country can have resources and mechanims to deal with the shocks. 2. I would plan the development while understand about risks as fast and as much as possible. Once risk is identifed and analyzed, the protection and insurance needs to be in place to deal with potential shock. The main thing I learned from the game is the resource moblization both in terms of time and wealth is very important for the development and related risk management. Effiecient resource moblizatin for a specific targeted need information, knowledge, and effective decision/judgement. 3. I would add the ""unknown unknown"" factor. In real world, especially in developing countries, given the limed quality data, capacity, and governance issue, a bit of "" unknown unknown"" factor could shape gameplayer to give more importanc to insurance and protection."197.161.36.202,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"Ireally enjoyed the game. It has great lessons regarding the risk assessment andmanagement. First of all is evaluating the risk considering both the impactand probability. One can spend a lot of time reading aboutProbability/Risk Matrix, yet the practical experience plus the lifedemonstration are different stories. Â Alsokeeping busy securing-protecting- your already done development activities hasgreat trade off as it will hinder upgrading or going to higher level indevelopment. Environmental analysis â€“research- has to be aconstant to monitor and forecast future changes. It is worth mentioning thatnot all risks need spending money and time to secure yourself of. Anothergood lesson is keeping the balance between vertical and horizontaldevelopment. Both should be run hand in hand. It is not good to focuson vertical development in one area leaving another area underdeveloped.Â Iused to work as program manager for healthcare development project besides mywork as a university lecturer for different topics related to management andmanaging policy change and I can say that balancing between verticalprogression and horizontal maturity of programs/courses delivery is a keyindicator for the level of proficiency for who is in charge for any one ofthem. The fact that secondlevel/layer development is more coasty than the first one. Watching yourdevelopment program flourish in one area carries a lot of positive feelings thatmy mask the fact that cost is high and getting higher. Even the running costex.

No need to say that thedevelopment indicator rises in higher pace after the first layer/wave of development.I used not to rely a loton insurance, et this game stimulated my mind to think of itrationally. It is much needed but one should calculate the level of expenditureon insurance versus the probability and impact of potential risks. And all ofthese should be expressed in monetary terms.

During the game you learn how to prepare in face of a possible disaster and how to face the effects when the event occurs. What makes the experience unique is that in this process the game asks you to combine decisions in different but interconnected levels such as development, economic, knowledge, insurance and protection As lesson learned, for example, in terms of protection you prove that it is important to make an effort to know the probability of occurrence of the event and also to measure the possible consequences. By doing this research it is possible to undertake protection measures that will reduce the impacts in case of a disaster.The insurance is also pointed out during the game and shows that the more developments you have the more you have to pay for the insurance. This fact demonstrate that even is the cost of insurance is high it is a necessary action in order to avoid disasters affect the path to development. The role of community is clear in the game because when a disaster occurs teamwork is key to reduce the impact in the society. Since I played the game only once what I would change if I play it again would be to be able to make more balanced decisions in terms of building new constructions and spending money in preparation. This because I think that may be I constructed new buildings too fast not always assuring its safety. Finally, I would only change a small thing about the game. My propose is to add a different kind of risk to the game so as you go truth the levels you have to take management decisions in a situation where you not only have to prepare and protect from a natural disaster because you also have to face with additional risk such as a financial crisis situation, or a technological disaster due to natural disaster such as in the case of Fukushima Disaster in Japan. I think this change  should be interesting since you can take more integral decisions in face of complex context that are more like the reality that we face in countries like Colombia. "197.237.90.126,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1.	ReflectionThe role of risk management in the game was to provide protection in the event of possible loss. Also, it required a strategy, planning and implementing decisions so as to develop the village fully. In addition, risk management helps the community to grow while being cushioned against risks and if the risks occurred, then it would help in minimizing losses.  To make a good decision, I had to consciously plan to monitor the environment, assess the risks and take corresponding action. After citing a comet, had to analyze possibility of occurrence and if it did occur, then what would the severity be. The speed at which I took actions to some extent contributed to whether I would be caught up and hit badly, lots of losses or I would be ready for any eventuality.I also noted having immediate savings helped me to minimize damage. In addition, formal insurance helped me to rebuild destroyed pods and at a cheaper cost. It was necessary to balance all the aspects, as the severity in the comet increased, so did the damage if it hit the pods. As my risk increased, I also found it necessary to buy higher amount of insurance because savings alone would not help much.As I prepared for risks, development slowed down but because I had to do research and also take protective actions. Later on it was easier to develop because I had taken necessary protection measures. I now had time and less worry about risks. This is because I was constantly aware of what eminent risk and potential losses and ways to mitigate as well as cope.2. LearningI learnt that it is important to carry out research constantly so that you can gauge the elements you are exposed to vis a vis potential damage in the event of occurrence and take the necessary decision on whether to protect or to insure. Saving was also important in reducing the damage. The higher the safer it is to, in addition to protection, transferring the risk through insurance. 3. Any changeI would recommend protection not to be tied to raising the island only because each of the pods could equally be exposed to not only floods but also drought. "138.220.94.113,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"Reflection from the Risk Horizon GameDuringthe game, risk management had a centralrole because I had to combine the capacity to prepare for risk with theability to cope with the consequences.Â The preparation phase included thecombination of three actions: -Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Gaining knowledge by looking out into the spaceand learning the chance of the comets hitting and the severity of the collision,-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Ensuring protection against the waves,-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Obtaining insurance.However,among them, I gave priority to knowledgeand protection. I consider knowledge as a central element of every activityand devoting some time to it helped me to accumulate more time to createcommunity connections. Concerning protection, it allowed me to sufficiently protectthe pods and reduce the negative outcomes. Consequently I preferred to putaside insurance, also in consideration of the limited amount of resources.Concerning the coping phase, I focused on assessingthe new situation and give priority to repair the pods because I knew that mytask was to develop the community as much as possible.The preparation for risk affecteddevelopment because every decision related with building and upgrading podshad to take into account the actions required by a proper risk management.Resources and time devoted to risk management had to be weighed with acontinuous and balanced effort towards the upgrade of the pods and, basically,an increase of the rate of development.I played the game more than once and,after the first time, I improved mycapacity of balancing the actions required by preparation and coping. Alesson learned consists in the fact that a good preparation for risk hadimportant implications on coping. In particular, a good protection against thewaves involved minor damages and costs to repair the pods.Â If Iwas allowed to develop a new version of the game to better represent the riskmanagement choices, I would give moreimportance and weight to the research, in order to better stress theadvantages of the research towards a better knowledge. Â Inconclusion, the game gave me the chance to touch, in a practical way, the difficulties related to the choice of thebest mix of actions in risk management, in presence of a limited amount oftime and resources. The reality could certainly be more complex, but the gameprovided an excellent simulation and taught me a good method to deal with thedifferent aspects related with risk management.Â Â Â "174.60.130.161,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,15.0 to 24.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-13.0 to 3.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,n/a,n/a,"I tried to play on Risk Horizon game for 6 - 7 times, but I still did not understand completely how to play it, how to use the tools, and tricks to win the game. The first 3 tries actually all I did were trying out how to work the game since the tutorial reading was not clear to me, but again, I never play any computer games, so this is very new to me. Aside from the game though, I learned more regarding the risk management, and how identifying risk, facing risk, study the risk, and preparing for the risk, can potentially giving the opportunity to reap bigger profit. One thing it strucked me on one of the video lectures that mentioning the tendency of people that 'easily forgetting' the risk when disasters do not happen for sometimes. It almost giving the presumption that it will never happen again. I actually ran into several people who own some business that terminated their insurances just after couple of good years, just to save money from insurance premium. This proves how easily people forgetting about risk when it's in fact still there, in exchange of small amount of saving.Another thing I learn from this week is how important it is to try to build safety net through the community.Â  Often community is willing to work together for the benefit of all, but sometimes what we need is just a few people who are willing to start it, and willing to run it. The ideal situation will be if those people are part of the community and have enough knowledge to organize it. After all, it does not need to be complicated and simple agreement will do. Trustworthy among members and the desire for every members to be successful are the keys.One of the obstacle I know that often faced by small business owners especially in developing countries are the high interest of loan. For example after the effort to get knowledge and study of risk management, and ready toÂ  get a new tools, then how can get the capital to buy it? Borrowing money from the local bank, not only the interest so high, they cannot even get approved. A lot of time, their option are limited to family or private sector who give higher interest, thus making the risk even bigger to loose the investment. This fact shows how important it is for every business owners to build some type of organization for safety net or for the needs of resources. I actually know some homeowners in Indonesia that getting extra capital from the local group who together putting the money together, each of the member put same amount of money, and every month randomly select the member's name who would be able to use that total amount of money as capital for their business. Some member who has the need to get access sooner than other member actually is given a chance to bit lower amount of the money each of the member has to pay, in order for that person to win the bid. In this case, that member will get less total amount due to the bidding, but that can be seen as an early interest that being paid up front. Sooner or later every member will have their chance to the access of the money, and the last member though seems they have to wait and loose the 'value of the time', butÂ  they will get the full amount as it was decided from the beginning and will save the money by giving the lower bid to the early bidders. This is a traditional way of getting capital from the local community that actually works good in certain area whose members are trustworthy and caring for each other without any type of forms nor complicated bureaucracy."219.239.6.109,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,23.0 to 54.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"In this game, risk of being hit is the only danger threatening your gaining enough scores to win the game in limited time. So the capacity of risk management is crucial for players to win.Time management is crucial too. I always find there was not enough time to rise from the shock of hit. How to rank the priority and allot limited time to the three major tasks in order to reduce damage and gain more score, is decisive for success. But limited time often makes this three measures seeming conflictive to each other. They all need time, especially constructing the pods, raising the ground and researching. So you have to find a better strategy to arrange these three tasks.I played this game several times. In the beginning, I spent most time build pods to gain money and bought the most expensive insurance to reduce loss. The result of this strategy was that I invested too little time on researching, so the damage was so great that I had no enough time to regain sufficient scores to succeed. Then I made some adjust in time allotment. But this time, I spent too much time on researching, then I found the construction was too slow to gain the scores needed, too. So in the later rounds I constructed a pod first to gain start money, then I bought a low rate insurance to cover the possible loss. After that, I watched for falling stars to see how much time I need to research. If the chance of being hit is high, then before Â investing much time to research, I started to construct several pods, so they could be built while researching. If the chance of being hit is low, I would continue to construct. And I found that if your preparation is enough, high rate insurance would be not worth it. And I found that use some time to raise the ground was worth your time. Raise the ground in precaution and research for enough long time, you wouldn't need spend much money on insurance, and you also save the time for reconstruction. Although I only make to level two, I still learnt a lot from this game. It forced you to choose something and give up something at the same time, and it made Â me to discern the different natures of the three tactics of risk management.Â It's a wonderful and inspiring game. But if I could make a small amendment, I will make the research process a add up process rather than a always from zero one. Because in real life, if you keep on researching something, your knowledge and skill will increase, too. So you won't always start from zero. In this game, every time the stars threaten, research always begins from zero. If this feature could improve, I think it's more realistic and fair.Â "93.91.90.38,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of Risk Management in this game is to build a Framework which will permit the community of Alora to pursue its development and at the same time try to contain the risks from the fallings of comets.The choices I made was to build pods on the places where it is possible or where the research works on the ground permit.During the game I confronted some trade-offs .It was specially between informatiions from the movements of comets and the protection in place during the phase of construction.When the risks from the coming comets are hight and the protection in place are unsufficient , I suspend the building process and try to increase the level of protection in order to reach or go beyonddepass the level of comets threats. When I got the correct level of protection , I start again the building operations.The preparation of risk affect development immediately and in a long term if the process is well managed. You see the outcome increase when you maintain your efforts constant and this can be visible and sensitive. On the contrary if the preparation of risk management is not well planned you lost many times in redoing the works over a long period of times and this affect development on short and long term.If I have to play the game just one time , while building the pods I will watch closely the movements of comets. As soon as I notice that the level of risk from the comets are higher than the protection system in place , I will stop the building process and raise consequently le protection level.If I have to play the game many times , when I gain the first round , I will try to consolidate the result by applying the same principles I used before and also some insights I got before in terms of level of destruction and the adjustments to make on the assurance fees.The mains things I learned from this game are :The general framework of Risk Management;the impact of a good risk management on the research;Risk Management is not an linear process but an iterative process.If I am tasked to develop a new version of game for the risk management of my country I will choice amongst manyÂ others risks , the financial risk.Â I will change the comets movements by the movement of international financial system, this will represent the external factors of risks.I will assimilate the pod building by the running of business on the national territory by: households,enterprises, community.I will assimilate time to the fiscal year I will replace the measurement tool on the left by measurement tool of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP).TheÂ insurance system will be the international insurance system.The bar of protection on the right will represent the work Â of administration to create a good environment for doing business.The research entity will consist of the community of various consultants who work for promoting business in the country.I will add an internal factor of risks , I will represent this by the movements of phenomen such as corruption , injustice ,unployment.These phenomenes will move in the country at the same time as the movement of international financial system.Â "41.184.92.110,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-11.0 to 8.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"It is generally believed that an effective and responsible risk management consisting of preparation before shocks and coping afterwards is an essential tool for development. the community Allora was faced with a major setback/risk which was capable of reducing the possibility of development.

The three main tools must work together to achieve an effective risk management,as these tools were applied in the game.first,knowledge must me applied,knowledge in form of research,and then protection is applied to shield when an actual shock takes place,insurance is then put in place to help compensate after a shock has been materialized.."103.248.32.6,6.0 to 10.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,23.0 to 54.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game showed us various aspects of risk management, the majority of them being assessing the magnitude of a risk, preparing to minimize the impact of a risk situation and to prepare for future situations keeping in mind the past experience. Basically, the game helps us to go through the fundamentals of risk management, which, if done effectively, could certainly lead to better opportunities and greater development.It is also important to know that development cannot take place at the cost of preparedness. A community, or any part of society has to take care of the risk involved while addressing a development issue.In the game, insurance was vital in case of post-damage situation, since it considerably reduced the burden when it came to redevelopment. But it has to be kept in mind that insuring at the cost of development, i.e. eating up essential resources to insure against threats is not viable towards achieving development targets. Knowledge is essential to minimize the risk involved by preparing better for the risky situation. Knowledge gained from past experiences, and ability to determine the threat involved goes a long way towards ensuring safety and stability. Without sufficient know how of the situation at hand only worsens the scenario, since even small threats could turn into huge risk situations.Protection is a vital part of risk and development equation, since sufficient protection insures the damage is minimized in case of a risk, and the impact is nullified if possible. Proper protection can promote safety, prosperity and development.Â I realised that using too many resources for protection and insurance hindered research and development, but at the same time, not having enough protection was detrimental to any kind of progress made as it had a certain negative impact due to the exaggeration of the problem at hand, without sufficient protection.I played the game twice, and during the second time round I realised that development takes place with proper safety and protection involved. Only development and little protection could prove counter productive. Also, the research done into avoiding the risk was more successful with sufficient protection in place. With proper risk management, development could last longer and the damage was minimized. During the second time round, my focus was on protection and aggressive development to compliment the research being done. It was important to beef up my defence before I could go for more development of the pods.If I was tasked with development of a new version of the game, I would like to have a system/power which predicts the possibility of risks, rather than only researching and getting the communities together during the time of a risk situation. Even with all the protection in place, the damage caused could be reduced drastically if proper prediction could be done. This way, the people would know whether to increase the protection level, or go ahead with more development if the chance and severity of a damage is low. Damages occurring in such a situation could be a potentially low risk situation which could promote more development, albeit, with proper insurance to cover up the damages at low costs.In short, it is essential to have an insurance cover to protect against possible damages, but at the same time, being over protective could prove to be counter productive. Whereas, having a high protection level could go a long way towards ensuring that development lasts over time, with proper research regarding every risk being done simultaneously to minimize damages."199.7.156.138,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â I began the RiskHorizon game with some trepidation. I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect: did not know whetherI would win or not. In fact, I didnâ€™t win in my first attempt. But, I wasdetermined not fail. Thus, after several trials I eventually won the Level 4 mark.The game, as elaborated below, taught me (and reinforced) several importantlessons, including the value of perseverance, diligence, strategic thinking andcommitment to communal progress and development.The first key lesson I drew from the game was that riskmanagement is not easy. It is complex and imbued in uncertainty but withperseverance and timely access to resources one can achieve a decent level ofpreparation against human and natural hazards. As a result, one can be able to preventand cope with the various negative challenges that may be thrown at them aswell as be able to fruitfully take advantage of opportunities that may emerge. Secondly, playing the game made me appreciate that perceiveduncertainty has many dimensions including the difficulties in appreciating: (a)the nature of risk (state uncertainty) â€“ in our case the dynamic nature of therisks (including their likelihood) that comets might visit upon our communities; (b) theresponses actors may take in relation to the risk at hand (responseuncertainty) â€“ e.g., not knowing all the options available to theactors/players, what action(s) to (not) take, and their efficacy; and, Â (c) the outcomes of the impact of the risks (effect uncertainty) - in our case the severity of the comet â€œattackâ€ùand it implications for development (see e.g., Milliken, 1987).Thirdly, although I â€œintellectuallyâ€ù knew that the key objectiveof the game was to attain progress by managing risk (i.e., by preparing forrisk and coping plus taking advantage of opportunities) I found myselfprimarily preoccupied by the â€œsafety-firstâ€ù mentality at the risk of notrecognizing emerging opportunities that I could have capitalized on to win ahigher level of the game. It was only after I got comfortable with the game thatI began to think more strategically than in my previous attempts. I modified mystrategies by focusing on more research, an eye on severity and likelihood ofthe impacts and speedy responses. Balance was key!Fourthly, I could not believe how engaging the game turnedout to be even though I knew very well that the game was a simplified versionof reality and that I was deliberately suspending my disbelief. Kudos to thegame designers! In arguably, there are still some areas that could be refined.For instance, I found the game to be too individualistic. For instance, havingto bear the fate of the whole community by myself felt a bit overwhelming. Therewere times I felt the need to consult someone in the community on what â€œwecould doâ€ù rather than â€œwhat I could doâ€ù! Moreover, the constraint that I couldonly undertake one action at a time seemed too tight. For example, why could Inot conduct research at the same time also do other things!? Â It isagainst such a backdrop that the one thing I could add to improve the gamewould be the addition of some component to the game whereby the player has theoption to consult members of his/her community rather than being the soledeterminant or decision maker.In conclusion, I enjoyed the gameand highly recommend it.Reference:Milliken, Frances. 1987. â€œThree Types of Perceived Uncertainty aboutthe Environment: State, Effect, and Response Uncertaintyâ€ù.

In the games that I was ableto progress quite far, I purchased 75%. This, of course, came at the expense ofdeveloping my town at a fast speed. Because more money was devoted to protectionand not growth and development, there was a slower development path. As atradeoff, acquiring more knowledge about impending threatsÂ (in this casethe meteors) helped decrease the amount of damage my town took. After a fewmeteors, I learned that the cost of recovering and repairing the town withinsurance was less when insurance was previously purchased.When I played the gamemultiple times, I tested different strategies. In the first few plays, Ipurchased insurance immediately and then devoted remaining resources todevelopment. This worked in that there was immediate coverage for the town,however in some cases there was not much to protect when the meteors came.In later plays, I purchasedinsurance at a later time, usually as I identified a meteor that couldsignificantly damage the town. This approach allowed me to build up my village,while scanning for threats. A challenge of this approach though was ensuringthat there was enough funding budgeted for insurance in case a risk appeared.A third tactic testedrevolved around the speed the base community was built and how they wereupgraded. In some games, I built and upgraded pods in a very systematicapproach. All pods were built, and then all pods were updated. However thisbecame less of an ideal approach as I ran out of time each levels. As I playedmore, I learned better and more efficient patterns on how to build and upgradepods in order to maximize revenue.Â I think a potential changethat would help make the risk management choices more realistic would be tooffer more specialized forms of insurance. Being able to purchase insurancethat is more specialized and resistant to meteors or floods as the situationdictates would be a nice â€“ and more challenging â€“ addition. Where I live,people purchase specialized forms of insurance that protects specific events.Â "178.194.24.89,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,35.0 to 44.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"1) In the game risk management as it was taught to us in theRisk and Opportunity MOOC has set an acceptable level of risk of comet strike forthe world of Alora, and then controlled and sought to mitigate that risk. Thatway the world of Alora could have been protected and has still been able to developirrespective of the various comet strikes. A risk management approach thatidentifies, assesses, manages and controls potential events may play the roleof a â€œguidelineâ€ù for decision-makers, not only in the simplified word of Alora.I was overly cautious in avoiding risks and have tended toadjust my decisions ""just to be on the safe side."" Therefore I have spenttoo many resources on protection, insurance and research and wasnâ€™t able to reachmy goal in time. By increasing the amount of protection and buying insurance I haveused resources that have been missing when buying development actions. Withoutthese actions the quantity of my incoming resources has stayed on a low level. Doingresearch has taken away time I could have spent doing other actions. For thatreason preparation for risk has affected development negatively both short termas well as long term.2) My emotion has biased my more balanced judgment. If Iwere to play the game again I would stick to my mitigation strategy as determinedat the beginning. In addition, I would take more risk in order to have moredevelopment.It's not possible to avoid all high-risk situations (comet flybys),so we need a strategy to handle the risk events (comet strikes) should they occur. Preparation and recovery efforts are importantfor the persistence of a country or an organization but they also decrease development.The main thing I learned from the game is that itâ€˜s all about balancing. Thechallenge is to be prepared for all possible risks in a way that allows us to takeadvantage of development opportunities.3) In the game the result of my decision is assumed not todepend on the actions of other decision-makers. For example, in real life lots of highlyupgraded â€œpodsâ€ù are not generating resources if there is nobody who wants tolife or work in because of a nonexistent protection against comets strikes. Sincethe development and the success of my organization depend on what others do, mydecision depends on what others do. In my opinion this aspect should also be illustratedin the game."110.22.213.180,0.0 to 2.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-11.0 to 8.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"Risk management in the game was about deciding whether you should try to insure against the inevitability of some damage or try to avoid some damage all together. this decision is helped by researching the risk. by researching I found some risks which seemed certain initially turned out to be nothing major and some others that at first glance were a small chance or of small impact, turned out to be a much higher risk. by doing that research it gives you time to make connections which help with coping with the aftermath.Â I only played through once, if I were to do it again I would spend less on insurance and more on building up the base. With the research done it provided enough of a benefit that much of the impact was minimised even when disaster did strike. I found that I spent too much on insurance when with better infrastructure I could have avoided more of the losses altogether. I think balance is important though, you can not rely on a single method of risk management. You can not avoid all damage, you can not insure against all losses. you can not plan for every event or outcome. by balancing the three areas you can minimise the exposure to risks. avoiding some risk, insuring the risk that is much more likely to occur and planning with how to cope with the damage afterwards. I learnt that it is very important to research what the risks you face are because without that research you think you have only a small risk so not bother trying to avoid the risk or getting insurance, but also you may perceive something as a large risk and want to buy insurance but then by doing some research you find out that much of that risk is easily avoided so the research has saved you some money.If I was to change one thing about the game it would be to add more options for insurance. Much of the risk avoidance where I live can only be enacted by the government so the main option for the individual is insurance. What risks the people want to protect themselves from and what risks they are willing to accept themselves is an important decision and many do not fully understand what risks they are facing. Once some research is done it would give them a chance to make more meaningful decisions about the risks they face."27.106.18.10,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"TheRisk Horizon game was a very practical application of the intricacies we havelearned about risk management over the course of the last two weeks. At first,there was a certain difficulty I faced in being able to handle the multiple activitieson-screen simultaneously against the ticking timer. Whatâ€™s important is, thatthis is actually how it should feel while facing risks as it is clearly apossibility of loss, an uncertainty. The three main aspects of risk managementbeing confronting, preparing and coping with the effects were represented by Knowledge(Research), Insurance, Protection. When I invested too much into Insurance Iwas invariably suffering losses but on a smaller scale. The development barkept sliding lower thereby often bringing me back to square one and posing as aconstant hindrance to the development. When I focused too much on Research Ihad to select the comets and I wasnâ€™t able to upgrade my pods, which was againfutile from the bigger perspective. For me, what worked was making sure I usedthe Protection bar right away so as to make sure I was preparing for futurecontingencies.Achievinglevel 5 in the game was only after repeated efforts and of course, trial anderror. At one point I was so engrossed in clearing the level I lost focus aboutmaking sure my choices were sensible or geared towards achieving a balance. Onlyafter playing the game a few times I started upgrading my pods instead of justcontinuously planting new ones. At the start of every level I lingered for abouta minute on the protection bar in-between upgrading my pods. This shielded mefrom the comets of low-medium severity. I also invested in medium insurancebecause I felt that I was spending enough on protection as it is. The momentswhen I was waiting for my green bar to fill I would research the comets just asa back-up measure. I learnt that risk management isnâ€™t just about balancingpolicies and corrective actions or depending on insurance. If you canprioritize and assess the circumstances itâ€™ll go a long way in the process ofrisk aversion and reduction.Ifthere was some addition I could make to the game it would be in the form ofmore than one type of risk. After a point of time the comets didnâ€™t damage mypods at all because of my high protection level. Realistically, this canâ€™t alwaysbe the case. There are numerous factors that play a role which determine theextent to which a risk affects a particular place in spite of the measurestaken in advance to prepare for them. The place where I come from, many typesof risks are not dealt or managed effectively because of ignorance and lack ofpolitical and governmental interferences. The imminent possibility of loss iswell-known to people but there is no communal spirit to unite and takepreventive actions until it is too late."178.168.60.88,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,15.0 to 24.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. In the game, I was all the time facing a trade-off betweenÂ spending resources (even game money or time) on development and risk management. Meeting development requirement was a condition for advancing in the game, so there was an continuous effort for developing. At the same time, failing to adequately manage risks will definitely lead to a setback in the development.There are some conclusions:- You have to know your risks. When a new factor of risk (in our case, comet) appears, you have to spend some time analyzing it. If your protection capacity at the moment are enough for preventing damages, you can concentrate further on development. If not, you have to increase protection, get an insurance and prepare for copping with the consequences (continue researching the risks).- Protection agains risks is the key factor. Your have to be prepared, even if building protection will slow down for a while your development. If the level of protection is adequate to the risk level, it will simply negate all the effects of the risk factor. Protection degrades in time, so you have to regularly rebuild it and verify if it is enough.- Insurance is a must have in the cases when protection is not enough to face the disaster magnitude. In the cases when protection is enough, and you are in lack of resources (most common cases in real life), insurance can be skipped.- In the case of disasters, you have to be prepared to cope with the consequences. This need a good knowledge of the outcomes of the disaster (research, in the case of game). Also, game show us the importance of fact and adequate reaction.Even in the short terms you have to redirect some resources from developing to the preparation for risk, in the long term losses avoided by a good risk management are higher.2. Initially I was trying to buy insurance at each level, as soon as I can. In the later games, I have started to buy insurance only when appears some risks that I was unable to prevent at that moment. From the game, I learned the following: You have to be prepared, to know your risks; Is better to prevent a risk, if it is possible, than to cope with it consequences; You have to get insurance for the risk that you canâ€™t prevent; and you must be prepared to cope with the outcomes.3. In the game, all the risks can be, theoretically, be covered by protection (highest level of protection cover highest damage). In the real life, there can be some risks that canâ€™t be covered. So, in the game can be introduced some (rare) comets with the level of damage higher than maximal level of protection. This will increase importance of insurance and research in the game, and will make it more realistic."105.224.219.28,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,30.0 to 33.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"Final code: GvgvzSAIn playing the game I was aware of the needto find a balance between development (to ensure continuous income and reachingthe goals of the green bar on the left), protection (ensuring I raised the landto meet the severity of incoming comets), and knowledge (researching only thosecomets where the severity was very high and I lacked the time to protect myselfenough). I failed the games on several attempts because I would waste resourceson raising the level of my settlement to a level beyond what was realisticallyneeded â€“ which then impacted on development because of the lack of time left. Iwould draw on insurance as a last attempt when I realised that a high-severitycomet was coming too quickly for me to research and I was ill-prepared. Thecommunity connections, when a meteor struck proved to be the most crucial factorin boosting my protection against damage â€“ it was often these communityconnections that I relied on to carry me through the crisis. Preparation forrisk often hampered development in the short term, but it did ensure steadydevelopment over time. It was far better to develop slowly, and prevent anydamages, than to develop quickly and spend half the game repairing. Doingresearch instead of raising the levels of the settlement was a risk I took,because the opportunity for increasing the amount of community connectionsoften tipped the balance in my favour â€“ resulting in overall protection of thesettlement. Iâ€™m not sure what I would add to the game to change it. One optioncould be to â€˜evacuateâ€™ in cases where the severity of the meteors was too highto cope with. This would, however, cost time and money (resources), and resultin damages to the settlement. Although itâ€™s not a great option within thecontext of the game, in real life itâ€™s often a choice which people SHOULD make,but donâ€™t (because they see the risks as far outweighing the benefits). Anotherfeature, which didnâ€™t come across in the game, was retrofitting existing housesâ€“ so those houses that are more developed, are better able to withstand shocksand risks. In lower-intensity disasters, this can definitely protect thehouses. Disasters disproportionately impact on the urban poor â€“ who lack theappropriate housing, or are living in areas where building standards are notmonitored or enforced. This causes the highest damages in events such asearthquakes. Developing buildings and critical infrastructure according to highbuilding standards, which are appropriate for the risks in that context, is anadded measure that cities and governments can take to protect theircommunities. "27.109.108.204,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"The Risk Horizon game was an interesting use of animation to educate me on the imperatives of Risk Management.The management of the risk of a meteorite strike averted damages andprevented development setbacks. The risk management involves gaining knowledge,protection and insurance thus minimizing the coping after the shock and allowsthe community to recover quickly. The trade-off was to progress to the next level by reaching the requiredamount of wealth while at the same time protecting the pods and gainingsufficient knowledge and insurance to reduce the coping after the shock.Another trade-off was building of new pods versus the upgrade of existing podssince investing in an existing pod was more expensive. However, it providedbetter protection and therefore mitigates the risk of the shock moreeffectively.Preparation for risk affects development immediately in terms of financingto gain insurance, conduct protection measures and to obtain information to reduceuncertainty in order to understand the possible outcome of the shock. However,the benefits from risk management for development, only come into affect afterthe shock occurs which can be very far in the future. That is why investing inrisk management in the first place although the risk seems to appear far in thefuture may not provide an incentive and impacts decision-making to invest inrisk management.Â I played the game twice and the second time I concentrated more on gainingknowledge and protection rather than building many pods. I realized thatupgrading the buildings (stronger structure) mitigates the risk moreeffectively than building many pods with a weak foundation, as they arevulnerable in case of a shock. I learned that only the interaction of knowledge, protection and insurancemitigated the risk most efficiently. For me, the obstacles were to invest inexpensive insurance and protection rather than building more pods in order toearn wealth. However, as stated above the investment in protection andinsurance paid off over the time.Â I would change the time constraint on the investigation of the shock. In myeyes, the biggest obstacle would be money, which you need to investigate thenature of the shock due to utilization of technology and consulting experts. Ofcourse, a time constraint plays a role as well, however two seconds to investigatethe shock doesnÂ´t imply a good risk management but good coordination skillswhich is not required to conduct risk management in this game. "41.203.69.2,0.0 to 2.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The risk management played a crucial role in the game by helping one take adequate step towards protecting the pods from falling comets.

At first, I was just interested in buying new pod and getting as many as I can buy, sometimes obtaining up to four before loosing the game. But in subsequent plays I stopped buying more pod and restricted myself to protecting the one, two or three I already have. This helped me stay alive in the course of the game. A take home lesson from the game is ""to be successful one most take risk knowledgeably and also take measures in protecting self against future risks"". Ans to Question 3Â I will reduce the numbers of time a pod need to be shielded from the impact of the comet from 10 to 4 or from 5 to 2. Ones I have assurance that my pod is completely shielded from impacting comet I will take more steps towards buying more. I will also make it faster to lift the platform in order to reduce impact from comet. I notice that the existing game takes some reasonable amount of time to be able to raise the earth platform.Finally I would include a faster option for shielding pod even if it is at a higher cost. This will be of tremendous help."116.75.96.134,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"hello everyone i am Aditya Jain , a student from India. So the first question is about how the game is related to risk management. I feel risk horizon,the game, is more about having to face a trade off between gaining knowledge about the risk,protecting yourself from the risk, insuring and developing the city as a whole and also coping against the adversities of the risk in this case the meteors causes to the city. So the trade off i faced was mostly between developing the city and protecting it against the risk caused by the meteors. so the first thing i did was insuring the plot and then start developing aid protecting the city simultaneously. But the major trade off i faced was gaining knowledge about the meteor.Â Now coming to the next question, yes i did play more then once.Actually,i played 3-4 times before i reached level four.the first time i played the game, i did not even reach the second level because all i did was protect the city and develop it a bit here and there. So the first thing I learnt was the fact that i had to strike a balance between protecting , insuring and developing the city because they all worked hand in hand.Gaining knowledge about the meteor was last on my mind. All i did was click more the meteor and check the severity and forget about the meteor and this was the biggest problem i faced and it costed me a lot at times because i did not know how to prepare myself against the possible adversities caused by the meteors. Now the last question, the one thing i would like to change was the knowledge about the meteors. If there was a possibility of making the severity of the meteors available then it would have helped me to strike a balance between gaining the knowledge about the meteors, insuring ,protecting the city, developing the city and also coping with the adversities caused by the meteors.Thank You."82.139.77.73,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"Throughout the course of the game I had to weigh up costs benefitsof the different methods of risk management. For example, I found there to be asignificant disincentive to invest in both protection and insurance at the sametime. On one of my play-throughs, I invested heavily in protection keeping thebar near the top, this enabled me to combat the vast majority of comets hitswithout receiving any damage by researching them and using the accumulated timeto build community connections, meaning I had no need to buy insurance for themost part, however, whilst applying this strategy on another play-through I washit by a series of very severe comets near the end of the round and was notable to protect against all of them, as my defences were eroded by each cometand I did not have time to repair them. Without insurance I lost a lot ofdevelopment and suffered a large amount of damage, which I was not able torecover from. Like the example given in this weekâ€™s video lectures about betterflood defence making floods less frequent and making residents less likely toprepare themselves for floods, I found myself preparing less for damage caused bycomets by not buying insurance and keeping less in the way of savings. Thisultimately resulted in a shock that I could not recover from in time. Additionally, I found myself trading-off between the formal insuranceoffered by the game and informal insurance. Whilst the game offered a formalpaid-for policy that pays out in the event of a comet there was also the optionto delay some development spending and store some money as savings rather thanspend immediately so that there was some money stored for repairs. In thissense there were immediate effects of risk management, in that not purchasinginsurance allowed me to immediately invest more money in development (the costsof risk management were immediate), but longer term risks from not purchasingthe insurance, as the cost of not having insurance if disaster struck was ahigher cost of repairing the damage (the benefits of risk management areuncertain and usually in the future). Â Inthe end I settled on a combination of the two: some insurance combined withsome savings. Overall this shift to a more balanced approach is what changedmost about my strategy from play-through to play-through. At first I tried toinvest heavily in one method of protection, but found it advantages to adopt a balancedmethod using protection, insurance and research roughly equally. Were I to redesign the game to take account of the situationwhere I live, I would take account of the possibility of risk management thatis not planned properly having negative consequences. For example coastal erosionand flooding is a problem where I live and whilst properly planned coastaldefences have protected the local population from coastal erosion with limitedimpact on the surrounding area, poorly planned defence measures have led to increasederosion and flooding in areas surrounding the defences, but not protected bythem. "37.191.7.238,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"ANSWER1the role of risk management can be manefisted in 3 aspects in this game, first, the significance ofÂ  aquiring knowledge of risk, if you just bury your head in developing new pods, i guess you can hardly pass one level. second, even ifÂ  youÂ  get enough knowledge for the risk, and take some preventative actions, in some cases, loss is still be inevtable. at this time,Â  you as individual is too vulnerabel to sustain. but you can keep sustaining with the help ofÂ  govenment and finance policy or social insurance.Â Â  third, after shock, if you can take corrective actions in time, your lost will be minimized and this can enhance your capability of resiliance.Â Â In this game, inthe beginning, I only developed a few pods, and when the comets arise, Iresearch the severity and hit possibility to obtain enough knowledge against thecomets. If Â the research result indicatesthat the severity is high, I shall purchase an insurance. If not, I shallcontinue to develop new pods. Only when the comets and the resultant floodcomes, I shall take the protection. Above all, with different levels of risks,the priority for the knowledge, protect and insurance will be different. in this game, you can see the preparation will imediately affect theÂ  development. if you do not update the pods level, if you do not research the comets, the losses and adverse influence will be much worse. and you failed to sustain to the second level of development. ANSWER2i think, the major different experiencesÂ when playing the game in the first time and the second timeÂ lie in, first,Â  in the second time, i did notÂ takeÂ extra actions for the coming of comets withÂ lower severity and lower hit possibility. second,Â i did not notice the effect of cometsÂ falling into the sea since i missed some game instrucions in the firstÂ time. in the second time, withÂ the experience,Â i took protections immediately after theÂ  cometsÂ fallingÂ down, so some losses was avoided. Â 4 thingsÂ should be kept in mind from this gameÂ the most imortantly is that,Â  when developing the pods, you should keepan eye on the possible risk, that is the comet hit. AndÂ taking measures on theright time will be very important. When risks materialized, time will become arare resource. Â You have to fightagainst it. Because the more time you grasp and take corrective actions, theless the loss will be.below are also some significant points, Â first ,in some cases, risk and losses is inevitable, what you can do is to advert the losses. although the difficulty of quantifying the risk severity,Â the more we learnt from the past shocks, theÂ stronger weÂ shall be when confrontingÂ risk.Â second, it is not easy to balance between the developpment and the following risks. but this does not mean we can bury our head in developing without considering the risk. in this case, if the risk comes true,Â  the cost of remedies will be much higher than the cost of taking preventative or prevention actions. third, time wil be a treasure in the event of coping afterwards. the more time you grasp, the less the losses will be. however the truth is that, time is always not enough. so we shall do more work in the prevention process to win more time for the coping. ANSWER3For me, I ONLY passed the 1 first level. Onemajor reason is that my mouse could not respond enough quickly to correlate alldamaged pods in the given time. So I failed to take protection against the comingflood. So if I could add something, I SHALL add other tools or resources whichcan be used to avert the adverse effect. Here in the game, the only resource istime and so it seems to be desperately valuable. Â "193.255.197.238,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Afterall the natural and/or unnatural disasters, reading the experiences is mostimportant and helpful issue. All catastrophes (earthquakes, mining accidentsetc.) gives a sign (for example radon concentrations in groundwater beforeearthquake) before it occurs. It could have a period or not. The game says thatpossibilities may be low or high but it doesnâ€™t change itâ€™s possibility toâ€œimpossibleâ€ù.Â  You may prevent from thedisaster and develop your planet but they are not enough if you focus only oneof them. Also the game shows their roles and importance by the simulated model.Â Iplayed the game in four modes: only knowledge, only protection, only insuranceand all three balanced. As the result of four games, I saw that three of thetrade offs should use effectively and balanced. If one of them might be missing,the results might be worse. If the knowledge might be missing, the incomingbecome less than knowledge-used model. If the money used only for improve theknowledge, developing improve faster but regresses very fast if any cometcrashes to the planet. It shows that only knowledge is not enough, alsoprotection is needed. But if the money might be used for only protection, theplanet could prevent from most of the crashes but it doesnâ€™t help to improvethe development level.Â  It shows that protectionis not effective itself, it is effective with knowledge. The experience showedthat sometimes the good knowledge and protection levels are not enough toprevent from all the effects of the disasters. The reconstruction and improvingthe level of development before the disaster is not a cheap process. But it ispossible to decrease also this negative effect after a disaster: by insuranceplans. If you make an insurance plan before the disaster, it could be easier tomitigate this costly step. Insurance plans are needed to cover part of the repaircosts.

Protection was slow buthad the greatest benefit for minor comet strikes, sometimes resulting innegligible impact. Knowledge not only helps players to manage risk betterthrough selecting more appropriate levels of insurance and protection, it also strengthenscommunity relationships and the communityâ€™s ability to manage risk and copewith negative events. However, it was not always possible to match the level ofinsurance to the level of risk. Overall, risk management resulted in less rapidcommunity growth while also lessening negative impacts and decreasing recoverytime which improved long term prospects for growth. Even with risk management,if the mix of knowledge, protection and insurance wasnâ€™t balanced, a cometstrike could result in significant damage and set back progress in thecommunity to the point that the community might not be able to recover withinthe allotted time. In playing the game multiple times I was able to refine astrategy for balancing knowledge, protection and insurance with growth thatwould work most of the with minor adjustments for each level. However, at timesit seemed that the order of the comets had as much influence on the outcome asthe risk management strategy. When the forecasted risk of a comet differed fromthe impact, near misses resulted in relief but also regret about otheractivities that might have been undertaken if the forecast had been moreaccurate. When a comet strike was worse than predicted risk managementmitigated some of the impact but not as much as would have been possible if theforecast had been accurate. In a future version of the game I would like to seethe ability to work on more than one component of risk management at time,perhaps through a scale that would allow the player to select the level ofeffort for knowledge, protection and insurance. In addition, I would like tosee the ability to select different levels of insurance for pods and makeimprovements while making repairs. Repairing structures after a disaster canpresent opportunities to build back better. I also donâ€™t think that failure ata level should always result in returning to starting from scratch. Certainlyfailure to manage risk can result in significant set backs including beingworse off than before starting but wouldnâ€™t always return you to ground zero."118.69.71.139,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Honestly, this game is trulyinteresting, especially it provides and simplifies all the knowledge about riskmanagement through Luminator legacy model. I think the risk management plays avital role in this game, consists of gaining firstly all the practicalknowledge that can help and using the tools in game to protect my village,secondly preparing the protection for the situation that the comets hit anddestroy legacy through clicking and holding button to raise the village,finally it is a process of confronting the risk and limit damages by purchasingthe insurance. Â Admittedly, in the first time Iplayed this game, I thought that if the legacy has all its necessaryprotections as same as the level of severity of comets, when the comet comes,my village would not be destroyed and become more vulnerable either, so I justused the protection tool, did not care about the community connection andinsurance, and spent money on building pots and develop and upgrade them. Andthe comets comes to prove that all my speculations were wrong and make meunderstand deeply about risk management. Although you have an expensive orcareful protection for your treasure, it can not prevent all the shocks whenthey happen. For example, after my pots were ruined by comets, it costed about147$ per one for restoration and rehabilitation, while I just had to pay for47$ per one if I bought an insurance packet before. This underestimation mademe have to face with the risk chain when I did not have enough money and timefor my legacy wealth. For the second and third times, I focused on the coordinationcombined research, protection and insurance, and of course community connectionto reduce risks from comets as much as possible. Unsurprisingly, the powers ofthese factors helped me reach level 5 before I have to get out due toelectricity outage haha. Â In fact, I understand that riskchain is caused by not only external enviroment, in this case is comets hittingthe legacy, but also internal conditions but honestly I did not realized therisk deriving from these reasons in game. If I have chance to develop more thisgame, I would pose the problems that the pots could be degraded, the communityconnections could not be managed effectively or so on, this game will becomemore reality and appealing. For many years, Viet Nam did not have any chances toembarke with other countries due to the limited international integrationpolicy of government, and anecdotal evidence shows that the risks come fromexternal enviroment could be avoided by this policy. But now, I think thegovernment and people in Viet Nam have changed little by little to accept therisk from outside to pursue further goals, pursue further opportunities. Beforedoing that, we have to try to solve and control the risk problems derive frominternal environment that are not paid more attention for many years."113.161.67.86,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Â Risk management plays an important role in passing levels ofthis game. The key point here is to balance amount between developingfacilities and making insurance. In my way, I usually pay attention to allfigures of meteoroids including research, severity, probability of hitting tomy facilities and speed. For preparation for risk, I buy insurance for loss andprepare budget to cover loss. However, I do not buy insurance immediately when meteoroidsappear. The time and amount for purchase insurance is different depending onspeed of meteoroids, severity and probability of hitting. In my point of view,choosing time buy insurance is very important in order to utilize my budget. Sometimes,I must trade off between high severity with low probability hitting and developmentto save amount to upgrade pods. At the first time I play this game, although I have readalready about guideline, I still do not understand the figures of forecastingrisk, buying insurance and how to pass level. Therefore, I do not pass level 1.However, at second time, I passed level 3 and lost in level 4. I believe thatmy ability for risk management is better: choosing suitable time to buyinsurance, trading off between development and loss and utilizing my budget. Themain things I learned from this game: (1) Forecasting loss and time ofdisaster, (2) We shouldnâ€™t focus on developing community without riskmanagement from disaster, (3) preparing all resources including financial factor,technology for protection and insurance to cover loss when disaster happens and(4) allocating budget reasonably for community development and risk management.Because it is simple game to manage risk, we should not putmany complicated functions in it. It takes a long time. However, if I were gamemaker, I would give some simple points to improve risk management ability. Somemy solutions are:Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  + Making more clearly some explanation how to passlevel for game players because I feel a bit confused when playing at the firsttimeÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  + The criteria should be given particularly suchas: number of pods has to be built in level 1, number of pods needs to beupgraded in level 2, level 3â€_ Basing on that, the game players will have goodplan to use budget.Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  + Now, the players have to make sense two keyproblems: risk of disaster and building pot.

Â It restricts abilityof players in creating income and using income. It will bring more interest tothe game. Second, if we put this factor to game, it requires players have tobalance among three problems: creating income actively, using income suitablyand reducing loss.

Therole that risk management plays at core here is balancing of resources:providing enough to sustain a civilization and utilizing enough to protect thecivilization from calamities. As such, the key to successful completion of thegame requires both solid understanding of how resources are generated and howthey can be used to protect against the external risks. Â First,the discussion will begin with how resources are generated. Up to ten pods maybe built on undeveloped land upon the alien planet, with each pod capable ofseveral upgrades and each upgrade carrying potential to generate more wealthand resources to the civilization.Â Starting with $1,000, the player must be wise on how he/she builds orupgrades the pods. While a greater number of pods and/or upgraded pods willeventually generate a proportional increase in wealth (which, in turn, could beused to build even more pods, upgrade them, or spent for protective services)and resources, it costs wealth and, more importantly, time to realize the return on these investments. It is alsoimportant to point out here that when wealth and resources are used in thiscontext, they are related but not the same. While wealth physically allowsplayers to invest in developing the pods, it is the pure resources, aside fromwealth, that these pods generate which ultimately decides the progress of thegame (as indicated by the shifting color(s) of the right-hand sidebar whichsignals to players if they are on track to completing the current level).Furthermore, developing and/or upgrading pods come at an expense to generatingresources because the pods cannot provide output while it is upgrading or beingdeveloped. Therefore, after playing the game several times, I found it morebeneficial to start off building and upgrading pods at a calculated andconservative rate rather than to go all out spending.Next,the discussion will continue with the tradeoffs between knowledge, protection,and insurance. The tradeoff here is that the player can choose to investheavily in both wealth and pod outputting time to build protection around thecivilization and completely prevent casualties from the comets, which oftendamages pods and thereby damages its outputting capabilities while costing theplayerâ€™s wealth to repair, or he/she could research the comet, whichconcentrates much less wealth and resource but has a tendency to accept damagefrom an incoming comet and plant a speedy recovery process that often involvesminimal to no damage repairs, especially if a solid insurance plan is alsoestablished in place. Either way, the proper preparation for risk must ensure acontinuity of resource output opportunities for the future; and consequently,on winning the game. I discovered somethinginteresting regarding the probability of hit and severity of a comet. A cometwith high severity but low probability is probably not worth your time. Or isit? What if it actually does hit? This is why I used an â€œexpected severityâ€ùfactor as a decision variable in selecting my protection level. The expectedseverity factor of a comet can be determined by adding the cometâ€™s probabilityof hit by its level of severity and then dividing the number by two.Finally, I wouldrecommend revising the damage recovery process of the game. Currently, it isbased on a sequence of manual motions that is dependent upon the playerâ€™spersonal reflexes. I feel that if the gameâ€™s intention is to teach risk andopportunity, then the process should be automated to represent the real world.Â "103.13.66.66,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"The Risk Horizon game is designed in such a way that force the player to think very deeply in terms of risk and rewards and how to manage risk in a proper way. It further forces the players to apply the knowledge that they gained from the readings (part of this course). I personally found out that insurance can help to a great extent when a damage happens and the cost of repair can be less then estimated. Insurance it itself was forcing me invest more although it is up to the player to manage investment and the risk. The damage could cost extensively expensive without insurance while purchasing insurance helped the investor (me) a lot. While the risk was not completely eliminated, it was actually transferred to the insurer and the risk was now the responsibility of the insurer. It is fair in managing the risk to transfer while not completely eliminating it. The size of the loss must be meaningful from the perspective of the insured (me). Insurance premiums need to cover both the expected cost of losses, plus the cost of issuing and administering the policy, adjusting losses, and supplying the capital needed to reasonably assure that the insurer will be able to pay claims. For small losses, these latter costs may be several times the size of the expected cost of losses. There is hardly any point in paying such costs unless the protection offered has real value to a the investor (me).Bringing the level up was yet another important aspect of the game. I discovered it very late in the game and it protected me from very severe damages. It was yet another indirect form of insurance the one could use. While i believe that this kind of option may not be that easy in the real life to experience and use once one wants to invest in construction, infrastructure, etc. Another important aspect of the game was knowing the risk actually. One can miss the risk entirely when becoming so busy with the investment scheme or one may know the risk but can't manage it properly. What i learned is to know the risk and management it properly through insurance or transferring risk to the insurer, leveraging it, manage it or eliminate it through different risk management strategies. Overall the game was very useful to know the concept of risk management further and apply it in the real life example. I personally found it very useful.

Because of those Comets careen intothe water and cause waves that hinder development, I might to balance betweengrowing my community and preparing for those potential shocks. Thatâ€™s the reasonwhy I have to consider to use three Luminator powers: Research, Protection andInsurance. I would rather to buy a strong scheme of insurance than payattention to grow Luminator too fast or focus on expanding my community. Besides,the more I accumulate research the more I can protect my community avoid thecomet hits. As for me, we do not know what will happen in the future so we mustdo our best in present and make it better in near future.If I play the game againin second time I would take more time to research and buy a higher insurancepackage. Insurance may be a mystery to many people. People trade off theaffordable cost of insurance for the peace of mind that a large loss wonâ€™t meanfinancial ruin. That makes you feel comfortable to growing your own task inthis game. Everyone knows what risk is in this game, we spend money to buildour community and we take the risk regularly when the comet hit, whether werealize it or not. The more I play the more I realize that in every decision Imake, I assessing the pros and cons, that the main thing I learn from this gameâ€“ do a risk assessment in risk management. The challenge is to make it moreconscious when it happens again.The benefits of riskmanagement in the game captures are huge. You can save a lot of money if youdeal with some comet hit in a proactive manner. The result will be that youminimize the impact of damage and seize the opportunities that occur. Thisallows you to build your community on time, on budget and with the qualityresults your plan. But if I am in task with developing a new version of game, Iwould build another risk event besides comets hit risk. In that case you haveto face more risk. So you need to prioritize risk. Some risks have a higherimpact than others. Therefore you better spend your time on the risks that cancause the biggest loss and gain.In my city, I think we mayset priorities and reviewing and revising risks in terms of changingenvironment. Understanding the nature of a risk is a precondition for a goodresponse. Therefore take some time to have a closer look at individual risksand don't jump to conclusions without knowing what a risk is about.Risk analysis occurs atdifferent levels so you need to set priorities and reviewing them frequently.Looking at the effects, I can describe what effects take place immediatelyafter a risk occurs and what effects happen as a result of the primary effectsor because time elapses. A more detailed analysis may show the order ofmagnitude effect in a certain effect category like costs, leading time orimproving quality of life. Another angle to look at risks, is to focus on theevents that precede a risk occurrence, the risk causes. List the differentcauses and the circumstances that decrease or increase the likelihood.Â Â "116.66.196.130,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-56.0 to -40.0,-60.0 to -39.0,-63.0 to -36.0,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,11.0 to 38.0,2.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to -3.0,"1: There is high risk of flood inthe community. The community itself is close to the river and high chances ofimpact to the people if severity of flood it high. However there is anopportunity to make different choices to protect the community. I made choices seeingthe severity of the hazards and its impact. If severity is high then I tried toprotect community, more investment on development. Similarly, analyze the situationproperly that how much investment I have to make to protect people and developmentwork so that there will be minimum impact of disaster. If there are low fundand severity of hazard is high then I buy insurance with proper analyseswhether it will pay back later or not. If the impact of hazard is not thatstrong and sufficient protection measures, the continue development workwithout extra efforts. The proper risk management averts damages and preventsdevelopment setbacks and understanding the environment in which risks andopportunities arise is one of crucial factor on risk management. This has providedopportunity for me to develop the plan and help out to make quick and rightdecision. Through this process, I was able to reach level 5.2: I played game twice. When Iplayed first time, try to see the impact of hazard and focus on protectingcommunity and investment on development without proper analyses of the costbenefits. Available funding, community network and insurance was completelyignored or not realized. When I played second time, then I was able to analyzethe different perspective on risk management. I was aware of the insurancepolicy and did thhe proper cost benefit analysis in addition to communitynetworking and support system. I realized that how Insurance can help toprotect adverse shocks. Similarly, the community support each other duringdisaster and made sure that how they can play effective role to minimize theimpact of disaster. I have learnt through the game that if we are betterprepare for possible disaster threat, in this case flood, we can easily managethe risk. Risk management cannot be done in isolation, there is need to haveproper preparedness through protection measures, establish the communitycoherence, cost benefit analysis either through insurance or intact risk factorinto development process. Similarly, we need to identify the obstacles of risk managementand ways to overcome those risk. When there is good preparation for risk management,then there will less adverse effect or impact and coping can be minimal whichlead to quick recovery with less investment. Lastly, I have noted that riskmanagement is cost-effective but not always feasible. It depends on the contextand capacity/interest of the community, stakeholders, state and internationalcommunityIn a nutshell, I have learnt thathow knowledge, protection and insurance can provide complementary means ofmanaging risk. It has provided wider perspective on risk management with visualand help out to grasp the concept very clearly compare to reading the reportand article. 3: In case of Nepal, there is lowlevel of awareness on the importance of risk management and limited capacity todealt with risk either disaster due to hazards or climate induce, economiccrises, civil unrest. Almost half of the population lives under the povertyline and faces daily survival. In this case, living with risk is normal phenomenon.In this context, I will add the components on awareness raising, capacitybuilding, risk assessment and prioritization of those risk with proper guidancesteps. Apart from it I will add the clear steps in tutorial course with example."170.56.58.147,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Therole of risk management in the game there is in to items 1st we should preventour community from shocks, and develop it also regarding to rightÂ meter. 2nditem if we will suffering the shock we must preparation for it and balancebetween preparations of shocks and growing of our community.when we will confront therisk we must have more effected knowledge (only useful) about what is the typeof the shocks and make enough researches about this chocks, to we can prepare thegood protections that we will use it to against the shocks, and also the typesof the insurance that i will provide my community in the better time to we canreduce the impact of shocks.when we face the risk, this risk will effect on our community and when we needto development this affects immediately or after some times based on the firstshock will following by second nearly, if it will be follow so the late ofdevelopment its better but if the affect risk on our protection so we mustdevelopment immediately.the different between the first once play and second time is what the types of cometswhat level ofÂ affect andÂ chanceÂ of hitÂ whatÂ is thelevel of insurance can beÂ paid, IÂ do more different things after thefist, like change theÂ protection strategy, and also change plan ofÂ devolvement,and use buttonÂ for change level of ground.The main thingsÂ that learned from the game inÂ when we face the negativeshock we must make enough search to we can prevent the shocks by preparationÂ strongprotection and provide the community by valid insurance.If I imagineÂ issue the new version from the game by changeÂ of the growingÂ itemsby true things like trees or plants and building to we can show trueÂ affectthe impactÂ of chocks, and also I can add option like play the gameÂ onthe network withÂ another gent.Â Â Â Â  Â  Â Â "14.161.12.197,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game is Balance Risk Preparation and Healthy Development						The player must balance between growing their community and preparing for these potential shocks by accessing three Luminator powers: Research, Protection, and Insurance.is very important.1) The first time, I am not understand how to play and play under my understanding, and not find the interesting of this game, but when I do again, I found it is very fun and focus research the comet and forgot the payer 's role to protect the island.

This is underpinned byknowledge, protection, and insurance. In my first few attempts I made a strategicchoice to build the community but at the same time did not compromise onbuilding knowledge of the comets.Â However it was over the next set of attempts that I began tobuild Alora with the combined use of the above mentioned tools.Â  By clicking on the comet I built up myresearch bank, which helped me put up protection measure. This enhanced theoutcomes e.g. minimise damage to Alora and help it flourish. However as thisprotection was not a total guarantee I began to incorporate insurance to help cushionthe blow from adverse shocks.Â  Â So at stage two and three I began to understand how to lookfor the severity of the comet and the chances of it hitting my pods. Tominimise the chance of a hit I ensured that my protection bar was fully alignedwith the severity of the comet. However sometimes it was too late to buyinsurance as the comet had already appeared and in other cases when insurancecover was available I did not have enough resources.Â  Â Whilst in literature terms and understanding I was full wareof the need to proactively deploy all the elements of effective riskmanagement, on the game it took me a while to find the right combination andreach level five. After a few hours of continuous playing I decided to approachfrom risk mitigating perspective which most insurance companies deploy wheninsuring against natural disasters. With this in mind I made one final attemptwith a revised strategy, raise Alora high enough to mitigate effect of cometsstrike, develop pods evenly over a period of time and take out both sufficientinsurance and research when the risk of being hit by a comet was high and Alorawas not appropriately raised.So on reflection the game is very intuitive and a must toolto help understand how it can use be used in everyday lives/situations. Itshows many concepts about finding the right balance/strategies to help makeeffective and tough decisions under budget, time and natural disaster environment.To put this into my perspective I did a cost benefit analysis when I was facedwith underpinning my house as a result of subsidence or move all together to asubsidence free area. By moving I would pay cheaper insurance premium but facefuture potential risk of subsidence including impact and shock in an areadensely populated with evergreen trees and known for heavy subsidence. Thiswould financially impact me more than rectifying my existing house as perinsurance instructions/research and thereby keeping the insurance premium downto a minimum. Â In this context the one change I would introduce to the gamewould the probability of subsidence occurring and the levels of it ranging on ascale of 1 to 10Â  with 10 being thegreatest and quickest for subsidence to occur. With this information people inmy area would be able to make appropriate risk management choices within theoverall risk chain."120.198.171.175,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,35.0

Horizon game prompted meto address the theory of risk management in a setting whereby both short-termand long-term implications could be experienced.Â  The game effectively demonstrates thechallenge of balancing protection and insurance against development and howseemingly wise short-term decisions can negatively affect long-term growth.Â  Â Iplayed the game several times and my technique changed with each game play.Â  To begin with, I adopted acautious approach, prioritising protection and insurance over growth.Â  Although this secured the community in theshort-term, it did not encourage growth or development and consequently did notallow me to progress in the game.Â  Ichanged my focus from the protection of my pods (raising the land to secureagainst the effects of a comet collision) and insurance (securing my pods sothat in the event of a comet collision, I would be partially covered againstany damage) to invest in development and improve research and knowledge-sharing(through understanding the comets and their potential impact); this allowed mypods to grow at a more sustainable and secure rate.Â  However, despite developing my pods at thissteady rate and obtaining lower-level insurance to protect them, several â€˜shocksâ€™Â  (the comets)Â very quickly destroyed what hadtaken a long time to develop.Â  I couldafford to repair the pods following the first shock, but had few resources leftto address the subsequent shocks and their effects, whilst continuing the levelof growth.The main learning outcome, forme, was that a cautious approach, whereby protection methods are prioritised over those ofdevelopment, does not always provide long-term benefits as the rate ofdevelopment is too slow and does not encourage growth or opportunity.Â  Combined with a lack of resources (forexample, where there are not enough â€˜podsâ€™ to generate income), options becamelimited and it becomes more difficult to maintain and provide adequate protectionfor the structures in place.Â Furthermore, research can help to negate the effects that a shock has ona community, by enabling greater preparation and communication betweenactors.Â  Whilst (mainly financial) resourcesdo help in the implementation of risk management, cheaper aspects such asresearch can be just as important in addressing potential shocks.If I were to change anything inthe game, it would be to add further types of risk to the equation.Â  By including families in the pods, andthereby establishing a community, the game could address a variety of risks including food shortages,financial crises, drought, crime, unemployment and disease.Â  Many risks are intertwined with others and itwould be useful to examine the complex natures of these, as presented in the game format."201.244.51.183,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to

My approach towards the game was based around the strategy of comprehensive development with protection and constant updates about the risk of cometsÂ Â for the long term. While for the short term, there were many instances when I had to make aÂ trade off from my long term goal. I had opted for insurance instead of protection when a comet with high magnitude was about to hit. This helped me to utilize more effectively the resources and save time as I didn't have to concentrate on protection activity but focus on development. The insurance package that I would opt depended on 2 factors - the level of protection I already had and the magnitude of the risk faced by Almora. Insurance also aided to disperse the risk over large number of people and minimize the effect on me. During situations when the the severity of the comet was slightly above Almora's protection level (say less than 3 points), I didn't opt for insurance. Instead I utilized that money to increase the protection level and also invest in development activity. I even gained greater knowledge about the comet in this situation, so as to get more time to communicate with the local population.In the entire game, it became extremely evident that preparing for the risk through knowledge, insurance and protection substantially reduced (or even nullified) the losses. I was able to focus more on development activities as the fear of loosing substantial resources were reduced. Protection measures proved to be extremely helpful in minimizing the losses from the waves and the comets. It certainly proved the adage ""a stitch in time saves nine""When I first played the game, I laid a greater emphasis on knowing the possibility and severity of the comets and protecting Almora from it, that is, I was more focused on knowledge  protection rather than development activities. I then realized that is also very important to induce coping mechanism as well as to distribute the losses through insurance. Hence, when I played the game again, a greater emphasis was laid on development and also on the need for insurance when the looming risk was pretty high. I also traded with the amount of time spent on acquiring knowledge by spreading it across preparing for it and developing the region.If I were to be in the team for the development of the new version of the game, I would certainly include the most important dimension of risk management which according to me is neglected in this game - the risk of operational human error. In the entire game, whatever strategic decisions we had to take were implemented seamlessly. However we are all very well aware that this does not happen in the real world. Actions are extremely prone to shortcomings compared to the plans because of humanÂ involvement. The risk of implementation is the greatest risk and needs to effectively captured in the next version of the game."186.136.157.84,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Reflections from the Risk Horizon gameWhat was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?It was awesome that the preparation of risk significantly increased the likelihood of advancing levels. It was a good lesson that take knowledge of meteorites (the biggest threat in the game) had to be in a balanced manner.If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I had to play several times to understand the importance of being balanced in the three most important aspects: preparation, development and contingency. The first attempt Iâ€™ve not considered all the threats and I barely accomplished the first level.Lessons learned is that, beyond having a good economic development, it should be better prepared for threats or for any inconvenience, everything is made â€‹â€‹in vain.The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?To make the game able to take aspects of the reality in which we live, the limitations should be given the difficulties to take cognizance of the threats. In the game the only cost of learning was not be able perform other tasks, when in reality we know that learning has a cost that the game is not represented in the best way.ConclusionProfit, grow economically, develop new technologies, to open markets or have a big city are useless if that development is not accompanied by good risk management, to take cognizance of the threats and treat them properly. Obtaining insurance can minimize the damage but much better is to have contingencies developed based on knowledge of the threats."115.97.42.137,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management played a key role in the game. The game basically dealt with the planet of Alora and how it could be protected against comets which was the main threat. Â In the game making the choice within what's to be done further was the most difficult one as it involved trade-offs which were serious. But as it is said, you have to sacrifice something that you want for something that you want more, I too had to make choices. The protection, knowledge i.e research and insurance were the key choices which were to looked upon in order to mention overall development. I as the Illuminator of the planet tried to first go for protection in few initial seconds. Then as I would see the comet approaching I would do the research and based on the severity increase the research and otherwise would make and update pods. Also based on the severity and chance of hit of the comets, I would take the insurance which would help in reducing repair costs. Preparation for risk would affect development in the sense that if one would use protection, development would stop thus affecting it immediately, insurance and making of pods would exhaust the resources and affected development in a while.I played the game more than once. Initially I was just trying to analyze what and how it is to be done and how can the planet be saved from its main shock hazards. In the first time I just focused on developing the pods without paying much attention to protection and without this the planet would become more prone to comets and thus underdeveloped. Thus the next time when I played I tried to balance it out by using protection towards the start so that it could be saved from comet attacks. Also I made sure that more focus was given to research as well as it would help cut the damage if the comet was hit. The main things that i learnt in the game were that just as in real life we require to manage risks effectively by dealing with these key elements how we can apply in this virtual world and its applicability in the real one.I would like to make a change in this risk horizon game. Although everything is presented simply and in a good format but yet the aspect of the mini game of making community connections to lessen the damage just didn't go well with it. This just seemed really unrealistic in accordance with the risk and there was no way available to be able to prevent or minimize the loss or damage. I would rather propose a very simple change of removing this game and just giving option of rehabilitation, recovery, by exhausting resources. So if one would have good amount of resources, he would be in a good condition and would be able to minimize losses whereas it would be unfavorable for a person with lesser resources. In the place I live, synonymously too this option is applicable that how at the time of hazard, the people are treated, rehabilitated etc to recover from it."41.86.41.13,3.0 to 6.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,14.0 to 49.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. The role of risk management in the game was to give playersthe opportunity to choose which risk management strategy to invest in, in theevent of meteor strikes causing destruction of the pods and financial loss. Iwould begin to build pods, insure at a rate of 75% because in the long run,this would save me a lot of money and that meteor strike was imminent. I basedthat decision on the fact that I could never be sure that any other riskmanagement strategy would work and result in 0% damages so for me, insurancewas the best solution that I could take, knowing that community connections wasnot 100% guaranteed to save my community.Aside from that, I also made sure that during development, Iwould constantly raise the platform to prevent flooding. I found this to beeffective especially just before the meteor disappears into the horizon.Research of meteors seems to be effective to decrease severity of the damagebut I managed to go quite far without having to invest much in research.2. I played the game several times, because I wanted toimplement different strategies. My first strategy was to simply go as far inthe game as I could based on features of the game itself. I managed to gopretty far by playing based on investing a lot on risk management. In the nextfew games I played, I tried taking a lot of risks. I realize that when I woulddo this, I could save a lot more money by not investing in insurance andcontinuously developing the pods but I would eventually run out of resourceswhen a meteor causes damages and I am trying to rebuild.I think the game brings out very important issues of riskmanagement if one makes the links; I felt very much like a decision-maker,aware of the resources available, knowing the options I have and doing what Ifelt was best. The difference however, is that in real-life, there is amisperception very commonplace in governments; that disasters are imminent andour job is to respond when much emphasis and investment should in fact beplaced on preparedness.3. I would include a contingency credit mechanism that wouldallow me more funds to rebuild and to payback little by little after thedestruction."84.91.170.90,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"The game taught me the importance of using the available resources at the adequate circunstance. It was clear that the three tools had different results as we evolved in the game.Â First of all, I noticed the importance of insurance. In an initial phase of the investment it is really important to garantee that the return will be safe and will not be threatened by high damages. Besides that, my main strategy in level 1 was to build as much pods as I could.In level 2, I gave priority to insurance as well and then I tried to improve my pods keeping them all at the same level, instead of improving only one. Protection did not seemed to be that important until this stage.Regarding level 3, I manage to improve my pods and kept them, once again, at the same level.I believe Iâ€™ve lost the game at the forth level because I did not use enought protection. Firstly, the damages for each individual shock increased substancially. Secondly, the repairment of the pods was too slow for the number of occurences. As a result I was still finishing the recovery from one shock when the next one occured. Besides that, the insurance seemed to be less efective in this stage, in which I used little protection. There might be a correlation between these two factors.As for the information about the comets, it did not seemed that relevant to me. That is also a possible reason for me to have lost at level 4."50.176.249.221,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"Risk management helped players to evaluate the opportunityto invest in the city while learning how to protect it from outside factorsusing mitigation strategies (elevating the city) and insurance. Information played a pivotal role in this game because one could learnif he or she had enough technology or mitigation strategies in place to protectthe city. For my risk and opportunity approach, I decided to build houses and use mitigation strategies at first. I boughtinsurance when my research (the information presented on meteorites) informedme that the probability of a shock was likely to happen and that my mitigationwas not enough to protect the capital invested in the city. Clearly, I did nothave enough capital and time to do everything at once: build capacity, researchabout the risk (meteorites), invest in mitigation, buy insurance, and cope with the shock. Forexample, if I used a lot of my time and resources to research about each meteorite,I would not build the capital in the city. Similarly, if I used all my resources to mitigate and elevate the city (protection), I would not have sufficient money to develop it toacceptable standards. The trade-off is, therefore, key to successful outcomesin the game and in real life itself. One needs to decide what strategy gives the best utility.Having the knowledge to make certain decisions and understand the short and long-termimpact of mitigation and coping strategies is of paramount importance to effective, sustainable development. Fortunately, I had the opportunity to play the game morethan once and realize how to better use my time and resources in order to takeadvantage of the opportunity and protect the city from imminent hazards. Â I started to think about the relationshipbetween time and availability of resources â€“ sometimes I had time left to usethe capital to invest in the city, but I did not have sufficient funds to do soâ€“ as well as the importance of research for smart decision making andmanagement: It was not worthy to invest a lot of money to protect the city if Iwas not allocating enough capital to build and develop the place. In fact, the more mitigation I used, the more expensive it became over time.Â In regards to developing a new game, I would also create aset of mitigation strategies with different costs and level of effectiveness.Sometimes, ordinary citizens and governments have different opinions on how tomitigate and cope with risks. Â They needto choose what mitigation or coping strategies they will use, if any at all. In bureaucratic environments, choosing what strategy to use is even more complicated.Â Hence, if people were able to choose whichstrategies they would like to use at a specific time to protect the city (e.g. elevatingthe city or building a wall), that would make the game even more realistic inmy point of view.Â "174.6.105.127,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"I did this game for severaltimes. Before I finished my second week study, I started this game for thefirst time. According what I learned from the first week, I knew ""riskmanagement"" is important when disaster comes.Â I think I can finishÂ atleast one level. ButÂ the result turned outÂ to be I failedunexpectedly.So I started toÂ watch the videos and read the martial.Â Finally,IÂ passed the second level.Â Even it is the extraordinary score, I havetried my best. What I have gained from this game are as following: 1.knowledge is important.English is not my first language, so it is difficult for me to understand theinstruction of this game. Such as, people should make effort to get theknowledge aboutÂ the ""risk management"".Â Nobody get this kindof knowledge by birth. Energy and resourcesÂ should put intoÂ this kindof learning.After I failed the second time, I started to re-read the instruction carefullyand tried my best to understand every sentence, not theÂ ""mainidea"".Â AfterÂ the reading, I found I hadn't understand how to""protect the community"" before I started play the game which is oneof the main reason leading to my failure.That is the example about that even people knows the importance of the â€œriskmanagementâ€ù, but still fails to implement. According to my experience, the costofÂ learning the instruction is necessary, and the benefit from thelearning is much larger than the damage I suffered from the game. But I willnever realize it before I failed two times.Â 2. Banlace is the main point of gamefrom this game, I think ""management"" is the thing about ""balance"".In order to survive in thisÂ game, people should balance time andresources, building and protection, researching and insurance.In the first level, I didn't feel money is limited. I can do what I want withenough money. So what I did is to buy the insurance first, because I knowclearly some risk I can't avoid. My researching and protection are not enoughat the beginning. I have to choose take the risk. The ""insurance"" isthe main factor to relieve of the damage and recover as soon as possible.In the second level, money becomes limited. I have to make choice when I shouldbuy the insurance, when I must increase the protection, when I need upgrade mypods. At that time, money always is shortage, I have to wait for the moneyincreasing to the lowest limitation, but comets were never waiting forme.Â I can't imagine how other people can make it under this condition.In every level, time is always limited. What impressed me most is Ican'tÂ do research andÂ upgrade podsÂ atÂ theÂ same time.IÂ did enjoyÂ when I saw ""no damage"" appear after a comet hitthe ground. But I still feel helpless. When IÂ did research, and found the severityis higher than my protection. But there no enough time to let me decrease theseverity or increase the protection before the comet hit the ground.It is a pity that I cannot finish the fourth game. I cannot imagine howdifficult it will be on the forth level. May it be possible, that the gamebecome easier, because all the jobs did in the precious level make a virtuouscycle in this game?I still have a question about this game. After comet hit and the damage cameout, I would have some time to arrange the coverage of the insurance. Therewill be several yellow balls on the screen. I don't know how to move it to mypods. Does it appear randomly?"174.89.56.89,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,-2.0 to 6.0,11.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,"Role of risk management in the gameThe role of risk management prior to completing this activity appeared to seem an easy balance. Â With the theoriesÂ that have already been presented, it was hard to imagine why for example certain countries such as India could not move forward and implement recommendations.When Â I played the game,Â IÂ then understood that risk management involves a balance between becoming knowledgeable, having the appropriate resources amongst established communities, research strategiesÂ and using insurance to help alleviate or cushion shocks which would happenÂ from time to time.AsÂ IÂ moved forward in the game, I realised that community involvement along with further development assisted other ""pods"" when damaged. Â The insurance taken alleviated much of the payment towards damages. Â Through constant development of my ""pods"" I was able to minimize risk although it was expensive to do. Â There were even times, I too, thought the asteroid would not hit based on my own behaviouralÂ bias'. Â I often risked further development and relied heavily on insurance. Â It was inevitable at least one of my ""Pods"" would be damaged. Â The questionÂ regardingÂ the amount of money needed to fix my ""Pod"" was more of a concern.Â Â I also saw that the other developed ""Pods"" I had established provided support to the other damaged, under developed communities, thus damages were minimalÂ based onÂ cost-benefit analysis.I was lucky enough to only play the game once reachingÂ the desiredÂ Level. Â Quite honestly, it was very stressful, managing funds, ensuring communities were developed, forecasting the likelihood of a disaster and purchasing insurance. Â What I have learnedÂ during this activityÂ isÂ that theÂ key to overcoming obstacles (shocks), is ensuring that information is available to all concerned, provide adequate resources, Â be realistic with design and implementations, and build foundations through policy development Â thatÂ areÂ constantly being revised over time as changes need to be made based on circumstances.If I were to develop a second edition to this game, I would ensure the instructions provided further clarity. Â In addition, I would like to illustrate further how ""pods"" helped other under-developed communities. Â I would change the meteor concept and perhaps have individuals on an island stranded and they would be required to learn how to live off the land. Â Through a first initial shock, one would become knowledgeable in understanding the shock, determining the probability and establishing appropriate measures to alleviate/cope during future shocks. Â In short, risk managementÂ in my community is important to me. Â ItÂ is about community connections, helping each other to survive in times of need/disaster and sustaining these connections.Â These ongoing connections have proven to be valuable throughout the years."103.16.71.16,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Game Reflection: In the course of playing the gameI learned a few things about risk management:The planet Alora is one that isprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one thatcan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen theimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect theplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:Due to limited resources like time and money.

We had to make various decisionsthat involved trading off knowledge for protection. When the incoming cometswere spotted, there were two things one can do. Either research on the cometâ€™sseverity or chances of hit for a long time (the severity decreases as researchtime increases) or use the information of a short time research and take actionto protect the planet. This trade off is important because in the first case,it can lower severity which is useful when we already have a certain level ofprotection. In the second case, research is traded off for time to protect theplanet by doing the need be. 2nd trade off faced was insurance anddevelopment. The limited money of the manager can be used for either reaching ahigher level of development or buying the most expensive insurance.

As risk managers we can protect the planet throughobservation which can tell us the impact of the incoming comet and according tothe severity we can raise the water level to the point where it does not causetoo much damage to the planet.

It was necessary throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time available to make sure this risk protection was limited.Alora falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.The power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage.Playing the game for the first time you will certainly find it difficult to access the amount of risk involved and possible consequences of it you may have to face if hit by the unforeseen factors, But given a chance to play again you will certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damage based on previous experiences.Main things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different ways to manage risk etc.If given a chance to develop a new version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups within the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each members with the group financially in times of need.

Risk Management is an integral part of this game as its requires rights actions to be taken at the right time due to the time constraints and the limited resources of funds given. While playing the game there were several areas to be considered that is the associated towards insurance the comets and the other dangers possible. The most important threat was that of the limited time which influenced quick decisions and sometimes the game to spoil because of the lack of the time.Â There are several requirements to be fulfilled while playing the game. They are as follows:a. Time managementb. Effective planningc. Risk forecasting and efficient planning to overcome themOne of the important indicators for the game is the insurance which enables the protection of the pods form the deep damages and acts as a source of risk management at the time of the fall of the comets.Â 2. I have played the game several times to understand the knack of playing the game. I have learnt that the game can be only played through proper planning and effective time management. However i have been able to only play for till the second level. I realized the fact that the insurance plays a predominant role in saving at the time of the hit of the comets and its very essential to keep developing the pods as they are always the source of increasing the points.I had realized that the game could only go forward if i made effective utilization of the available as they need not be saved. and must be fully and effectively used.Â 3. The game is an effective one which helps in analyzing the various aspects of the risk management effectively. However if i had to develop a new game it would contain more effective features of visualizing risk and having better options of improving the conditions of risk management I would aim at developing better sources of developing better risk management tools for the purpose Therefore i can say that risk management is an effective tool forecast thereby control risk in an given scenario.Risk management not only forecasts risk but also suggest measures to control and reduce them so that the disadvantages of them can be reduced effectively. Nevertheless it seen that there are several means of risk management They are as follows:1. Risk Avoidance2. Risk sharing3. Risk Transfer4. Risk diversification5. Risk planningThere are several steps in the risk management process:a. Identification of the objectives: In this stage the objectives of the organisation or the country should be seen.b. Determining the various risks associated Â and thereby risk identificationc. Identifying the various available alternatives for effectively controlling the identified risksd. Evaluating the various risk alternativesÂ e. Choosing the best among the available alternatives that best suits the firms or the countries needs and objectivesf.

Review and changes made on the regular basis according to the need and objectivesThus it can be concluded that risk management has been the need of the hour today nations, firms and globalized organisation are aims at designing measures through which they can effectively control the risk and the uncertainties as they have become one of the major reasons for the fall of the several nations and the countries. Today the world bank and the united nations organisation is predominantly aiming at this protection of nations form such risk and uncertainities effectively.Â "103.16.71.16,3.0 to 6.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,-38.0 to -27.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Game Reflection: In the course of playing the gameI learned a few things about risk management:The planet Alora is one that isprone to falling meteors, a natural risk, that cannot be avoided but one thatcan be managed. -The role of risk management in the game was to lessen theimpact of the falling comets on the planet, to take control and protect theplanet through raising the water level by observing the incoming comets.-Trade-off:Due to limited resources like time and money.

The role of Risk Management in the game is to protect Alorna from regular natural disaster, hitting by comet and flooding. with good knowledge through series of research will help us to measure what types of risk and its impact and severity, in this game understanding more about the habit and characteristic of the comet, then by that we can develop the right strategy and implementation for protection. Through appropriate protection, increasing the ground level to avoid from flood is necessary. Taking protection actions need resources, then we need to really have a good level of protection of measurement, to make sure that we put the right action and investment (not something fancy Â things that beyond the needs), but just right or be realistic in developing the strategy. Preparation Â will give immediate impact by avoiding flood, but also after some times, when the comet missed and no flood. at the same time it is also affected to the development (pod) because its increased the regular cost (resources needed). Through a good knowledge (research) of the comet characteristic and measurement of the severity and frequencies, the insurance purchase can be choose based on the severity of potential damage made by the comet.Â it is also need a good knowledge of the obstacles especially related to lack of resources obstacles in this game, prioritizing the resources without have to jeopardize the environment and pods.in this game, I choose to invest more on pods construction and having minimum insurance purchase (the lower level) considering the possibility and severity of the hit of comet based on the research. Â Â I think, it should be done in simultaneously between all aspects such as building pods those that can generate income, to conduct regular research gathering the information and knowledge that will support in decision making on what next to be done in regards of preparation, insurance and copping. Â it will be good to calculate also the cost and benefit analysis between having regular pod or up-grade one, in-term of cost invested (178 to upgrade the pod) and added value received from that.Conduct research on how this building affected to the preparation stages.Â In general, the game reflect what is risk management. I would make some suggestion on the game such as: more information on how much each pod will give income, is there any impact of having the expanded level of pod, I am still don't understand how to establish the connection in this game.Â "77.99.153.129,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of risk management in the game was to reduce the likelihoodand impact of damage caused by comets to enable development of the community totake place at an adequate pace. Initially, I tried to balance investments in the threepreparation functions available in the game:1.Â Â Â Â Â Â Insurance, which allowed the use of funds duringgood times to reduce the financial burden of repairing the community followinga comet impact later on2.Â Â Â Â Â Â Protection, by raising the land, to reduce thelikelihood and impact of damage caused by a comet strike3.Â Â Â Â Â Â And research, to increase knowledge of the riskfaced, which also allowed me to better judge whether to invest in, for example,in further protection or in development of the cityA number of trade-offs were possible, for example, neglectingprotection (raising the land) because of the high cost involved, but taking outinsurance policies which would cover a high proportion of the costs of rebuildingin the event of damage. In my case, I found that heavy investment in researchwas effective, because this also allowed time to create community connections,which was also a protective measure. However, research was quite timeconsuming, which meant I was less able to spend time raising the land(protection) and developing and building the pods. In my game, raising the land and research (includingcreating community connections) both appeared to have short-term payoffs, byincreasing my knowledge of the potential risk (allowing me to choose where tomake investments) and by reducing the impact of comet strikes. However, itâ€™snot possible to say how effective they were, as itâ€™s not possible to know howmuch damage would have been caused in the absence of these measures â€“ at leastnot without playing the game a second time. This demonstrates the difficulty ofuncertainty in decision making and also the political difficulty in takingpreparation measures, which may be costly and have benefits which are lessvisible, as their success is demonstrated through an impact not happening (orbeing less severe). I played the game only once. In the end, the biggesttrade-off I made (and the reason that I only made it as far as level 5), was notbetween different preparation measures, but choosing to invest heavily inresearch, which reduced the time and resources available for the developmentand construction of pods. The community did not develop quickly enough in level5. This was a demonstration that my approach was perhaps too risk-averse;instead of taking the opportunity to develop the community with excess funds, Icontinued to undertake activities to prepared for comet strikes â€“ even though thecommunity did not suffer any damage until level 5. If I were to change one thing, it would be to make lessdeveloped pods more vulnerable to a comet strike. This would more realisticallydemonstrate the higher vulnerability of those with lesspower/resource/knowledge etc. and the ability of those with greater resourcesto be more able to withstand disasters and continue to prosper in the face ofadversity.Â "116.108.44.3,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The role of this game is very important to me. It enabled me to clearly understand risk management processes. The game is set up and helped me know deeply what I should do to confront the shocks. I had to balance and use eficiently time and budget to build the pods, raise the village, research the comets. After the game, I noticed that I have to apply the knowledge and solutions from The interlinked components of risk management to address the shocks. According to such diagram I have applied ""knowledge"" to identify types of comets, chain of hits, severity and when it attact. Next I apply ""protection method"" to such as raising the village to reach safe levels of 4, 5 or 6, depending on the type of the comets which may impact on the earth. If I do not have time to upgrade the village's land to requied level, I will choose ""insurance method"" by buying insurance for the pods at the highest cost. Besides, I also regularly research the comets in order to reduce impacts if comets hits Earth as ""coping method""Besides that, when the incident occurred, I had to react quickly by notifing to the whole pods that help them to tacke negative risk and mitigate the bad effects to the village.

In this game we have to develop and take careof the world Alora, which is constantly target of different kind of comets. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  While developing our community,we have to research about comets that are threating it, we may take precautionsor insurances of different levels. If the comets hits, we have to take care ofthe consequences of it. Repairs are needed, more precaution must be taken andespecially research. Not forgetting to keep developing our community, as it notalso improves its lifestyle as also improves its communication, as a precautionto the threating comets.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  A game will never show us howreal case scenarios are or could be when facing a threat; However, this simplegame show us how difficult it must be, as it might be a simple game, but noteasy at all. Managing the funds of the community along with time and threatscan be quite challenging. Playing the game a few times was enough for me tounderstand that we can not approach one concern more than other. Developing theresources of the community and researching about threats are equally important.One can not substitute the other. Neither can insurance take place ofprecaution. We have to divide our funds, time and worries in everything, asthey do not substitute or compensate one for other but complement each other,being interconnected and essential.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Reflecting around thistopics and the challenges of the game, we are able to connect it to real life scenarios.African countries and developing countries in Asia, like India or Bangladesh,for instance, face this hard challenge every day, every year. All thiscountries, some more than others, are threat every year with such disasters asfloods, fires, hurricanes. Most of them face poverty and hunger, along with fewresources and low funds. So, we put ourselves in their shoes by playing thisgame. If they have low funds and resources but are constantly threat by allkind of disasters, new or old, how can they face that? They have to getpriorities.In the beginning we are such as those countries, poor and with lack ofresources and knowledge. Â So, when areable to get resources, we should, even if it is not much, it is a start.However, threats are priorities. When a priority is detected we have to researchabout it, get to know the severity of it, if it is avoidable. The more we knowabout the threat, for example, a hurricane, the more we can do. This way we canstart preventing the community, so everyone can start to get ready for it, wecan create insurances for communities, communities can help each other to avoidbigger lost. With knowledge we are able to inform the community so they canprevent or, and, also take insurances. That way they will be able to cope whenit strikes. This is exactly what happened in Bangladesh, thanks to knowledgethey could do all this, prepare and cope better when a hurricane was about tostrike. This way, they are also developing their country and improving theirlifestyle and decreasing lost and mortality.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Without knowledge nothing ispossible, is the biggest lesson of this game. If you do not have informationyou can not do anything, neither to prevent or cope with consequences, neitherto develop. Without knowledge and developing you can not even pass the first level,in the game, but also in real life.Â "31.52.56.241,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 35.0,36.0 to 40.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"The game focused on the preparing for and coping with the outcome of the potential risks that were demonstrated by the comets. I was allocated a certain amount of money every few seconds depending on how developed my city had become. This money was in turn available to either re-invest and further develop my city, pay for insurance or pay for protection.The choice I made was to always save enough money first of all to pay for either level 2 or 3 insurance, then the remainder was spent on development, with any remaining money (under construction/upgrade cost) being spent on protection. I paid the higher amount on insurance so I wouldn't incur great costs even with little protection, This for me was the trade-off, I could either choose high insurance and low protection or, low insurance and high protection.Â In order to pay for either protection or insurance, this would slow down the rate of development because the opportunity cost of expenditure on those means there was less money available to invest on development. Also, if money was spent on protection, this would stagnate growth completely (hence why I preferred insurance over protection and why I would only spend on protection when I had reached the growth goal for that level.)I would only spend time on research where I had a reasonable level of protection, had already paid for insurance and didn't have enough money to spend on upgrades.I played the game twice, first time I reached level 4 and the second time I reached level five (only losing because a comet hit and did 20% damage with 7 seconds to go!) The difference was that in the first game, I focused much more on protection rather than developing my city. This makes me realise that not all efforts should be put on dealing with risks because it may adversely affect other things such as growth. There also needs to be a lot of balance, it is possible for countries to grow while also protecting themselves from any future risks.Â If I were to re-create the game, I would create different kinds of risk that have the inverse severity/chance of hitting as the comets meaning the player would would to allocate appropriately where his costs would go to. Another idea would be to have a random 80% comet that hits at any one point between levels 1-6 and if the player hasn't implemented the appropriate measures in that level, it would inflict a massive amount of damage. This ties in with what Erwann said in his video talk about having a short memory and just because we forget what may have happened in the past doesn't mean we shouldn't be expecting it.Â "117.3.4.27,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Coordination and balancing ofresources in risk managementBy: Nguyen Duc TanThenature of the Risk Horizon game has heightened the need for furtherunderstanding of the role of risk management in the development. The gameindicated that if we fail to plan or balance knowledge, protection, andinsurance, we fail to manage risks effectively. By using the nature of the RiskHorizon game, this essay argues that the coordination and balancing ofresources is very important in the process of risk management for decisionmaker. Noone can deny the importance of risk management when playing Risk Horizon game. Inany community, especicially in developing countries, development is always underscare resourses. How to develop the community under scare resource why meeting alimited or controlled milestone is likely a headache for any decision maker. Inthe game, the risk management is very important since it requires player to identifythe priorities for quick action under scare resources before the comets hitwater and cause waves damaging the pods. For example, the player has to decidewhat needs to be taken immediately: Research, Insurance, or Protection (as Irefer to as â€œRIPâ€ù). For me, I played this game first time and focused heavilyon Protection at first, then could not move to level 3. Â Therefore, identification of priorties ofaction is a key to risk management, otherwise obove RIP is likely a kind of â€œRest, In, Peaceâ€ù for the community.IfI played the game second time, I would do differently by focusing more at firston research since knowledge and information are very crucial for riskpreparedness. I have tried the research and know that it definitely increases communityâ€™scapacity in their connections against repeated shocks. The key things I havelearned from the game is that decision makers and community should try to doany actions which cost less to prevent potential shocks before they cost andthat Research should come first to save cost and life. This is also a keymessage from the game: â€œEverything we do has some cost, whether in time orresourcesâ€ù.Iam not alone in my view that potential risks and shocks are diversified interms of impact. Therefore, if I am tasked with developing a new version of thegame, I would add at least two more risks into the game. The more risk the gamehas, the more capacity for risk management shall be likely to be improved. Thefirst risk is that there is no money left and decision maker has to think abouthow they can mobilise and engage limited resources from the target community toprotect themselves. The second risk is that the comet will hit the communitydirectly. In that case, evacuation and temporary relocation of community canarguably be a better option.Thisshort essay has discussed the role of risk management via the Risk Horizon gameand argues that generally good coordination of resources under limited timeframe and resources is a key to good risk management. The evidence andimplication from the game suggest that Research, Insurance, and Protectionshould be prioritised under specific conditions based good research. More risksshould be added into the game to diversify the risk management options to helpcommunity be better at confronting any potential threats in future.Â "187.240.81.104,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,14.0 to 49.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"Question: What was the role of risk management in the game?

It is not a trade off betwen protection and development but is the concept of development itself that must be understood. Â What is development (in the game) to build more and more houses??

Any young man here in Veracruz can pass this game easily, and aftherthat, this person will spend all of his money in a party or wathever silly thing because he/she do not understand the purpose of the life itself and why it really matters to grow and protect theirselves. Â Imagine: here, you can die everyday in the street because the war betweel the drugsdealers is dangerous. You can go to work and return and see your wife and children dead. Also there is an insurance that you can buy to protect your house from an huricane. Do you think you will act rationally about the huricane insurance? In order to psicologically survive you will need to think that risk does not exist that nothing will happens (maybe because the hollymary protects you or whatever) Â Then you will not be rational with the risk management."130.159.148.47,6.0 to 10.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,1.0 to 17.0,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,3.0 to 11.0,"It is easy to see that only building pods and not spending any money on protection / insurance / knowledge is not enough for healthy development. At any time shocks can happen and destroy much of what you already had. The role of risk management is to minimize, or at least reduce, the losses caused by the meteors.It is definitely not a easy task to choose between building, knowledge, insurance and protection. Money and time were the main obstacles in the game, so planning what to do and where to spend money was a big thing while playing. The first two times I played, first thing I would do is to buy the 75% insurance plan, but that would leave me with not enough money. After a while I figured that maybe saving some money on insurance and investing on protection would have a better result, because when protected, the meteors sometimes had no damage on the city - I guess insurance is important but you have to balance it with protection. When you are well-protected you don't need that much of an insurance.Choosing on what meteor to study was also a tricky task. There is a need to balance the chance of hit and the potential damage of the meteor. After a while I figured that even if the meteor had huge chance of hit, but its potential damage was much lower than my protection, it would be better not to spend much time on it, and study other meteors with higher damage. Besides that, there were faster and slower meteors, hard task. - Balancing the potential damage and the chance of hit is crucial for knowing what risk to study, and it is an important and hard task.One thing I would change about the game is how the damage occurs. When the meteor hits and there is not enough protection, all pods are affected about the same - destroyed by a percentage. It does not happens in real world. For example, in Brazil there are many floods. Sometimes the poor looses 100% of their assets, while the rich doesn't lose anything. Maybe if the smaller pods were affected more then the bigger ones, or the other way around, or even just a random distribution of damage, instead of even, that would represent better how the risk affects the society we live in."212.85.203.30,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"In the game, risk management was used as a tool for sustained development. Engaging in research helped me obtain adequate information to predict whether or not the meteorites would hit, and which tools of risk management I should Utilize in order to mitigate damages caused by their occurrence. Insurance help in getting back on my feet after the flood easier and lessen the financial burden. The tradeoffs made during the game depended on decisions i made regarding the use of time and resource. Spending too much time researching on an incoming meteor resulted in less time to protect the village by raising the ground level when other high severity meteors immediately follow the one under study. Insurance put a strain on available resources for further development in the long run as it got more expensive. In general, measures put in place for immediate possible impacts, without regarding future impacts, stifled development in the long run. Planning for both long term and short term provided a more stable condition for development to progress steadily. After playing the games several times, i realised effective risk management as a tool for development can only be achieved when measures for dealing with risks are spread over a variety of tools for a long period of time, and not only focused on one tool. if asked to develop this game id add health insurance"219.92.62.33,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"http://disposablewebpage.com/turn/e7Zm2h8G9N Manage Risk1.Â Â Â Â Â Â What was the role of risk management in thegame? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in termsof knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for riskaffect development (immediately, or after some time)?Answer:Role of Risk Management in the gamewas to prepare, sustain, cope and rebuild based on the Research informationgiven on each Meteor that impact on the planet. I had to make a calculative riskanalysis based on information that was provide, plus on the severity of thecomet impact. Hence a calculative assessment was on the making to protect andpurchase Insurance. If there were any damages, the rebuilding cost was anacceptable level. The preparation on risk affectingon development was very minimum and immediate because the knowledge was obtaintherefore an effective decision was made. Development of pod was neverhindered. Hence the key word is â€œresearchâ€ù to better prepare for anycircumstances. Protection is very crucial in any disasters, first we procureinsurance for financial aspect but the pod survival was another. We had procureadditional coverage for protection by rising the pod level of elevation. 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â If you played the game only once, what would youdo differently if you were to play it again?

Â It was important to do makerepairs while continuing to monitor potential future shocks as it was likelythat the damage would be worse if there were unrepaired assets.Â  Shocks also seemed to destroy or reduce the effectiveness ofsome of the previously installed protections.Â I found it best to try and repair these as soon as possible so that continualupgrades could occur.The further the game progressed, and the more developed thecommunity, the higher and faster the resources seemed to grow.Â  This was good as it enabled me to keepupgrading and also insuring the assets.Â  I learnt, the first time playing the game, Â that prioritising and balancing the riskmanagement strategies was the best way to progress.Â  It seemed, however, that constant researchand focussing on the worst risks remained the most important strategy to managerisk as this enabled me to prioritise my actions according to the most likelyimpacts.If I were able to redesign the game, I would probably add severaldifferent options for protection including some that cost no money but onlytime.Â  This would more realisticallyreflect the risk management approaches that I currently take in my current placeof residence."176.36.147.5,10.0 to 66.0,2.0 to 3.0,69.0 to 435.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The main purpose in the game is to apply in â€œreal-lifesituationâ€ù two main objectives of risk management: produce resiliencemitigating losses from the negative shocks and achieve prosperity inthe developing community by building pods, earning money and investingin the future development.While playing the game we learned to apply mainconcepts of risk management: preparation, knowledge, protection and coping withthe outcomes. The game starts with the opportunity given: we have the financesthat can be invested in building of pods. However, as in real life situation wewere confronted with the negative shocks which occurred gradually (we could seethe comet coming and had time to do some actions to prepare). In order toprepare for the shock we had the following tools:Knowledge. We could perform researches     to find out about the potential risks we had to confront (severity of the     comet meaning how much distraction it will cause and assess the chances of     its hitting the water). Insurance. We could insure our     pods from the risk which can help us in the future to cope with the     outcomes. Basically we shared the costs of recovery. Protection. We could invest in     protection. Protection costs money but it worth financing due to its positive     outcomes in the near future. Results of protection sometimes cannot be     seen because we donâ€™t know what could have happened if required actions of     preparation were not used, however, they are needed to be implemented to     decrease future costs while being in the stage of recovery. The process of coping in the game was dependingfrom the actions taken while preparing. The higher the level of preparation wasused, the easier the process of coping. Â More research made, gave us     more time to use community for recovery process. Â  The more expensive insurance was     used, the easier and cheaper it was to recover in case of comets with high     severity level. By increasing level of     protection, we were able to cope with comets with low level of severity.     Even though they hit the water, no or little damage was made. Â The most difficult during the gamewas to find the required sequence of actions in which risk management has to beimplemented and create the strategy for preparation and coping. Iâ€™ve played thefirst level for several times, and the most successful was when I decided topay more attention to the research of the comets and my horizon began to growand turned green which gave me the sign that my actions were correct. During thefirst level it was necessary to get acquainted with the nature of the risk andperform research. In case the severity of comet was too high to cope, and I understoodthat my level of protection was not that high, I just tried to make diligentresearch and get the most expensive insurance. However, I always had toremember to leave some money for recovering from damages. During the secondlevel of the game I invested in development by building more pods, boughtinsurance, invested in protection and continued to make researches but were notable to receive the required level in horizon.In order to change one thing in thegame I would propose to add financing instrument. That is one of the problemswhich we are confronted in Ukraine while confronting with risks. Â There can be new tool implemented called â€œbankâ€ùfor example. In case we invested too much in construction and now donâ€™t havemoney to cover for destructions, we can take a loan. As well as we can makesome savings for the future and get extra income by earning interest income.Â "145.64.254.240,0.0 to 2.0,4.0 to 5.0,0.0 to 15.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"The aim in the game is to develop the island taking into accountnot only the time and the money one has, but also the possibility of damagescaused by comets that can impact on the planet. The tool we can use to manage therisk in the game is the window to monitor the behaviour comets. This way, wecan predict the danger we will have toface in order to decide how to useour resources (time and money) for developing the island the best way possible.In facts, thanks to this tool, one can know the Â«Chance of hitÂ»and the Â«Severity of the impactÂ» of each comet. This way, one can decide:-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â either to not monitor the comets too much (in the case it has alow Â«Chance of hitÂ» or Â«Severity of the impactÂ») and use the time to lift theisland-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â or to monitor it properly (in the case it has a high Â«Chance ofhitÂ» and/or Â«Severity of the impactÂ») and save money for furtherdevelopment/restoration/insurance; in this case, moreover, we gain some â€œextraâ€ùtime to reduce the damages.Â In fact, there is not enough time to both monitor completely the comet and lift the island, so I needed a trade-offbetween the two aspects. Moreover, when I was not satisfied with theprecautions I was taking, I also opted for different levels of insurance. Allthese moves were bounded by the available money (and the willing to go ondeveloping).Personally:-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I preferred to try to avoidtoo-high insurances in order to savemoney for the development and the lifting of the island. On the other hand,-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â I tried to avoid liftingthe island too much not to waste money. Moreover, this way, I was also saving time in order to monitor the dangerous comets as much aspossible.Â In my case, I think, preparation for risk was affecting thedevelopment in a long-term scenario.For example, as said before, I was monitoring the dangerous comets as much as Icould and I tried to lift the island little by little in order to not have toloose time and money repairing the damaged buildings. This way, I had to wait tofinish the first levels to have a â€œvery-liftedâ€ù island but, at the same time, Imanaged to have well-developed buildings.Â I played the game only once but, if I were to play it again, Iwould choose less insurance as I did since I saw that I was able to affectivelylimit the damages.I learned from the game that is really important to use the toolsavailable for â€œmonitoringâ€ù the risks in order to be able to predict the possible scenarios and,accordingly, be able to choose the best trade-offs needed to reach the finalaim.Â I would like to add the possibility of earthquakes, this way onehas to deal also with a risk that is â€œunpredictableâ€ù.For example, one can learn how to:-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â take reasonable extra-precautions,-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â face anunexpected situation and-Â Â Â Â Â Â Â how to change his plans while the work is going on."41.216.170.14,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,-32.0 to -12.0,n/a,"1.

Additionally, insurance was a useful tool in situations where more thanone meteor (the source of the risk) was occurring in close succession. Also inmy experience, preparation for risk made development slowerâ€”as more time andresources were spent on protection, there was less wealth available forupgrading existing pods or building new ones. Next, having played the game more than once, mystrategy evolved as I went. First I figured out that I was more likely to meetthe development goal when my community was comprised of more lower-grade podsthan if it had higher-grade pods. Although the higher-grade pods were moredeveloped, there was a trade-off and diminishing returns to them if any damagedoccurred. For example, the higher-grade pods were more expensive to repair sotherefore the meteors were causing more damage that could not be repairedbefore time ran out. Following, I think the most important thing I learned inthe game was the importance of community connections as a form of insurance anda way of managing risk. If I saw a severe meteor was coming in too fast, Ioften relied on community connection as a way to minimize the imminent damage. Finally, one very frustrating aspect of the game wasthat the time in the level did not end once the development goal was reached.There were many levels in which I had already reached the development goal butwhen a devastating meteor appeared in the last 30 seconds I simply did not haveenough time to prepare so I would lose that level. Therefore, one thing I wouldadd to the game would be an early warning system, like a â€œseven day forecastâ€ùof the upcoming meteors before they come into view. I think this would be apractical additional tool for risk management in the same way that a seven dayforecast and storm watch systems are useful for managing the risk of snowstorms in New England.Â "96.241.121.70,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-36.0 to 1.0,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,-38.0 to -13.0,"1. The role of risk management was at the heart of thegame.Â  At every point of the game, youneeded to balance between building and upgrading pods (development) and protectingyour investment through research (knowledge) or raising the island(protection).Â  When this failed,insurance was the fallback to mitigate losses. Â Initially, I emphasized the development aspectbecause it was necessary to further build pods.Â However, as comets entered play, I would invest in research despite thecost.Â  I would click on the comets to seewhat the severity of the impact would be.Â If it was high, I would increase the level of protection.Â  Knowledge was key to being prepared, even ifit meant just spending a few seconds on a meteor.Â  Without any knowledge, it was a complete guessworkas to whether or not the level of protection was adequate or if insurance wasneeded.Â  With knowledge at hand, I couldmake an educated decision that would lower the risk of damage and also lower mycosts.Â  Ideally, it was by investing inprotection, since damages not only set me back financially but also affected mydevelopment level. Also, protection carried over to the next levels as opposedto insurance that needed to be renewed. If it was clear that I would not haveenough time to protect myself, I would make an informed decision on how muchinsurance to take based the severity of the shock and the likelihood. For example, if the severity was at a bar 6, I kept in mind thatmy research (and community connections) could provide me up to 2 bars ofprotection. Therefore, I used my slider to raise the island up to bar 4 beforethe shock. If I didnâ€™t have enough time to reach that level, I purchased aninsurance plan. This technique would minimize the damage and bring me to thenext level. Â Finally, once my developmentwas at its maximum for a given level, I would divert all my remaining time toraising my protection in anticipation for the next level.Â 2.Â I played thegame several times (probably too much!) and it took me a while to reallyunderstand the causes and effects of the different functions. In the beginning,I was building too fast and didnâ€™t really know how to use the research functionor I invested too much in protection/insurance. I mostly learned how tointerpret the information and that not every comet required an action on mybehalf. When I felt like I was not making any progress, I had to go back andread the instructions. It gave me a better and clearer understanding.Â  The main thing I learned was the importance ofunderstanding the correlation and interaction between the various factors thatcome into play in a given situation.Â 3.Â I wouldpropose that whenever a player fails a level, he would go back to a previouslevel, not necessarily always the first one (random?) because failing toachieve a goal in life doesnâ€™t always send you back to square one.

If the community isnâ€™t preparedfor a disaster then youâ€™re really in trouble. But preparation can stand-alone;a community canâ€™t put all of there resources into preparation because how are theygoing to survive then? So I learned the trade-offâ€™s the community faces when adisaster occurs. The best mix of goods is in my opinion 40% preparing, 30%growth in wealth and the last third is knowledge about the disasters. This isnot only the order they should occur, it should depend on how urgent thedisaster is. If there is time for growth in wealth and knowledge before thedisaster occur it would be the best solution but again wait and se how thescenario develops and react on the base of that. My ownperformance in the game was level three and I fail to make the society growenough so along side preparation I couldnâ€™t make it to the next level.The gamewas surprisingly true to the hard choices the community faces when a disasteroccurs and I have learned to use the tools given by the MOOC."213.161.145.242,3.0 to 6.0,2.0 to 3.0,0.0 to 15.0,8.0 to 29.0,35.0 to 53.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The game consists of 4 factors of risk management; defined as knowledge, protection, insurance and coping in the course. There are also; the obstacles faced or scarce resources like time, financial assets and ability to analyze the situation and utilize the tools. First; the level of knowledge or even awareness about the risks should be increased, like increasing the research factor of the comets. Then increase  protection, but it should be balanced with the development activities since too much protection wastes sources of the community which can be directed to development. Insurance can also be used for recovering after a disaster, but financing the costs of this tool should be kept in mind. The last factor, coping abilities of the community which also needs agility in the game, provides after disaster recovery by using networking.     In the game, comets are the threat against development of the community. And I had to optimize the usage of the resources for the preparation activities, by decision making which had obstacles like limited time, knowledge and skills. Preparation for the risk, either can prevent the damage all together or reduce the degree of damage. Recovery after a disaster is also less costly if you had preparation beforehand.I played the game more than once. The first one lasted too quickly because I didn't do any research about the comets. Since I was involved in learning the other aspects of the game. On other trials as I get familiar with the game, I started to use the factors of the game more effectively. When I paid too much attention on protection for instance, development fall behind. This game of simplified model of risk management, can be developed by adding a random option of ""guess"" about the upcoming comet's feature.

Â Due to thisrisk management approach, if my planet was hit by an asteroid it didnâ€™t costmuch, or the planet had a high level of protection resulting in no damage.Â  Such risk avoidance further reduced anyincentive to finance research and gather information of the asteroids.Â  This resulted in a planet that did not gatherinformation but had multiple upgraded facilities with higher insurance policiesand protection. I played both a demo/trialversion and the official game.Â  Havingplayed the trial version first I didnâ€™t find any immediate benefit to financingresearch.Â  The information for eachasteroid was presented if it was clicked upon, thus there seemed no reason tofurther research the risk, but rather finance other risk management optionssuch as insurance and protection. Â Changes I would propose forthis game center on the risk management method of research.Â  Although I am aware this is a game meant tosimplify risk management themes, I consider the research/knowledge gatheringmethod to be undervalued in this game.Â  Toreflect the true importance of research/information gathering in riskmanagement, the game should provide less information about the risk of eachasteroid.Â  Such a lack of information, oruncertainty would create an incentive for the player to finance research inorder to better understand the magnitude each risk (asteroid) represents.Â  Slowly the game should reveal moreinformation of each asteroid (such as how often the asteroid orbits the planetor may hit it), and this would then alter how the finances are allocated.Â  If the game remains as is, there is littleincentive for players to fund research (as I have mentioned previously above),and rather allocate finances to insurance and protection.Â  In reality, risk management approaches suchas insurance are not as preventative as research, but more retrospective. Overall I thought the gamewas well designed to illustrate the difficulties presented to low-income areas,and the decisions faced by risk-prone locations. "103.16.70.11,10.0 to 66.0,3.0 to 4.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,17.0 to 38.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"Risk management played a pivotal role in this game inprioritizing risks and preparing to cope with them.

Due to limited resources, it wasimperative to make the right decision to ensure minimum damage and optimumutilization of such resources. For instance, if 2 comets were approaching theisland, I had to immediately prioritize the risk of each on the basisof certain parameters. If say, comet 1 had a higher severity with a low chance ofa hit but comet 2 had a lower severity with a high chance of hit, I wouldimmediately start spending resources to build community connections and gatherknowledge on comet 2. Tools such as the power of protection and insurance are universal insafeguarding against all comets. However, the tool of knowledge, beingcomet-specific, was only used for highly dangerous comets. Thus, by making atrade-off between risk and resources, I wasable to proceed with each level of the game and protect the community.While making preparations for the shock, again atrade-off had to be made between development and risk management. Due tolimited resources, sometimes, development of the community had to be halted sothat the techniques for risk management could be adopted. Often, I would notupgrade or build pods, but instead spend resources to raise the island, buyinsurance or gain knowledge. Sometimes, this had an immediate impact on developmentdue to a vicious cycle of growth that was created. In order to gain moreresources, development of the community was essential while usage of such resourceswas imperative for managing risk. Thus, in the short-term the risk was avoidedby compromising on development while in the long-term lack of developmentslowed down the process of growth of resources.Â Having played the game more than once, I learnt certainvaluable lessons with regard to making the right decision for risk management.Initially, I was unable to cross level 1, as it was difficult to prioritize therisk and make the timely trade-off between risk management and development. Thereafter, I realized thatdevelopment of the community was imperative to building resources at a quick paceto face the continuous hostility. I also realized that it was unnecessary toprepare for every comet as it would only result in loss of resources. Thus, Ibegan prioritizing the severity and probability of hit of each comet and accordinglyspent resources for gaining knowledge and building resistance of the community againstthe shock. All this had to be done very quickly to help the community survive thebarrage of incoming comets. This game, being a simplistic reflection of a real-worldcrisis, was insightful in many ways. I learned the importance of timemanagement, risk prioritization, economic usage of resources, correct andjustified decision-making with regard to coping with a hostile risky environment.Â Hailing from Calcutta, India, I have come to realize thatcorruption reaches its peak at the time of a crises. Coupled with an inadequatesocial administration mechanism, this can be a major obstacle in riskmanagement. Thus, I propose for the development of a tool for building a justand efficient social administration system to provide equitable protection and social justice toall citizens of the community.Â "62.32.68.27,2.0 to 3.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,8.0 to 29.0,-11.0 to 12.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,36.0 to 40.0,1.0 to 17.0,22.0 to 68.0,23.0 to 54.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,2.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 11.0,"Good day,First, I have to confess that I like this game.When I had heard about it at first time, I was assuming it quite boring likethe most of educational games. And I was wrong.Security and extension linked in this game. Youhave to keep your security strong at the expense of evolving, but you also needto improve your economy.At the beginning of the game you have enoughmoney for both: defense and investments in the economy. To my mind, stages from second tofourth (inclusively) have more importance before others - you have to plan youractions very carefully and maintain a middle ground between development anddefense. Last stages are quite easy - you have enough money for everything youneed.I played this game twice. At my first attempt Icaught a game's fatal error at the last stage, so I tried again. Insurance is abit useless and comets research is really nice - that experience I got from myfirst try. In real life I really like insurance, but in the game it does notwork as effectively as I expected. Itâ€™s too expensive for the middle and earlyphases of the game - you better invest that money in defense and extension.Nevertheless I bought it in the late phase in order to copying. And cometsresearch is very helpful and cheap, and can save your economy.If I was tasked with developing a new versionof the game, Iâ€™d rework insurance part. Maybe something like insurance history - almost like in real life.Would make insurance more efficient, but every insurance event significantly increasethe cost of the new one. For this reason, a long time without incident makesinsurance cheaper. I live in Russia and I think it reflects the idea of â€‹â€‹riskmanagement in my country - you should always have a higher level of securityand several reserve funds, and also maintain a good reputation.As I said - I like this game.

The role of riskmanagement in the game is to cope and prepare for the uncertainty whilst takingadvantage of opportunities through the building of developmental projects. Throughpreparation (by investing or doing a research on the comets), one is able havea knowledge to face any shock these comet may pose.Â  Waysin which Preparation of risk affect our developmentKnowledge, protectionand insurance constitute preparation. Preparing for risk either throughresearch or knowledge helps to minimise the level of shock that will occur. Havingan informed knowledge and taking practical steps about certain uncertainty may eliminatesome of the obstacles we might face in our developmental goals. Depending on the amountof wealth at hand, sometimes is very important not to invest in insurance atthe initial stages. The type of insurance to buy is basically dependent on theknowledge of the risk one has. Insurance companies can sell a product whichwill not be beneficial if you donâ€™t have any knowledge of the risk at hand.As the saying goes, â€˜preventionis better than cureâ€™- is very prominent to protect ourselves rather thanthinking of having a cure for it. In certain instances, the cost to prevent animpending danger is relatively less than the cost in repairing it. For example,in Ghana where the rate of mosquito related diseases is higher, is advisable forthe populace to protect themselves using mosquito nets or using insecticide2When I played the game once,I was focusing all my attention and resources on building and upgrading thepods to the detriment of investing in developing the community. For instance Ipaid more attention on buying insurance and I was not able to progress passlevel 1. I then realised that to strategically balance preparing for risk andinvesting in developing the community, I should equally gain knowledge (research)and Â have a form of protection. I have learnt a lot oflessons from playing the game. Playing the game has enlightened be to be veryobejective. I need to get myself prepared and take on some risk or sometimes Ineed to act when a shock has occurred. I also learnt that increased informationvia research helped me to understand the nature and the likelihood of risk i.e.reducing the uncertainty. Through the knowledge gained, I was able to protectmyself from any eventualities with the aim to mitigate losses and increase anyprobability and positive outcome. During the game, one remarkable thing that Ilearnt was that Protection and having knowledge in itself is not sufficient toeliminate or minimise risk. Sometimes, one has to go the extra mile ofobtaining insurance to help cushion the blow of any shock in an adversesituation.3.Crisesrepeatedly happen because people fail to implement the needed improvement inrisk management (World Bank Report, 2014). In my current city Coventry (UK),when snow falls during winter time, is extremely dangerous to drive or walkaround. In my candid opinion there should be stringent laws to help save livesduring those seasons. For instance there is a law in Germany which oversee toit that individuals are to clear all snow (ice) in front of their houses,drivers to put on winter tyres. The loss of live that occurs during such periodcan be reduced if such laws are adhered strictly as in Germany.Â  Â Â Â "1.178.225.102,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,-39.0 to -2.0,-63.0 to -36.0,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"This game made risk management and its challenges tangible by managing the few mechanisms in this fast paced meteor environment. The main challenge was balancing these techniques and investment in resources. A key lesson was that protection was a long term investment and that research also allowed to cope in a cost effective way. The main role of risk management in the game was to manage theimminent and ongoing risks of the meteors hitting the development. Namely, wehad to try to maintain a level of development while choosing the right time andamount of protection by lifting the land to reduce or prevent the impact of theshocks, an optimal amount of insurance to transfer the wealth to times of need,and sufficient research to allow our pods to prepare and pool resources to helpcoping mechanisms. This was not always easy as we had to choose the rightamount of each to continue to provide sufficient development. Obviously, youcannot invest in research and protection at the same time, and you have tospread your money across the three components as well as your developments. If you invest too much in these risk management techniques,your development suffers and you lose the level. Each of the components haddifferent impacts on your development -if you invest in insurance, yourdevelopments may still be impacted by the shock and you need to try to repairwith limited resources, while research allowed you to evade the impact of theshocks at a limited cost and protection was a long term investment for yourpods. So we had to try to choose the balance of these components that were effectiveand cost efficient in the circumstances, in a fast paced environment. As I continued to play, I found the most useful techniquewas protection, as this was a long term solution that proved cheaper than insuranceas my development advanced, and freed my resources to continue developing. Thiswas an interesting reflection of the challenges we face in the real world-where knowledge of research and even understanding of risk managementtechniques can influence coping mechanisms. As I became more confident in theprocess, I could make the most of times when I had good level of protection toinvest and develop- which was another valuable lesson. Basically, the game helpedmake these risk management techniques tangible and understand the challengesthat can emerge in deciding upon risk management in a fast paced environment.One mechanism that would the game more realistic for mewould be information on which pods were running more profitably or choose toinvest in an accountant who can help you decide on which risk managementtechniques are more efficient, as this is information you would have in the realworld and can help you make better investments. Another mechanism would beother risks, perhaps meteor showers on the pods or differences of opinion betweenthe pods because these are other kind of risks that would influence this worldand how they would cope from the shocks that affect it.While these mechanisms would make the game more realistic for me, there were many lessons in risk management that I will take into the future."115.97.7.200,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,17.0 to 35.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,3.0 to 13.0,-14.0 to -2.0,-41.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk Horizon involved the protection of anouter space settlement from comets. It involved the protection of thesettlement, research of the comets as well as insuring the settlement againstdamage. The aim of the game was to allocate resources in such a manner thatresearch, insurance and protection would take place in such a way that it wouldbe beneficial for the settlement, and reduce the possible damages fromapproaching comets. Risk management was an essential part of the game not onlyfor the reason that it involved the reduction of the possible risks from thecomets colliding with the settlement but also because it lead to development ofthe settlement, exactly how it leads to the development on an international aswell as a macro level.Â Â Another important part of the game was usingresources for what was actually necessary for the development of thesettlement. If I were to play the game again I would probably try harder tobalance the utilisation of my money and time. At times I would end up wastingtoo much money on protection rather than research hindering my ability toreduce damage from incoming comets. I also managed to understand how riskmanagement is associated with time, risk management, undoubtedly, has to betimely in order to be efficient, effective and beneficial. I concluded thatresearch was more valuable in comparison to protection and hence I was able torectify this and create a more desirable balance in the later stages of thegame. I was able to reflect the importance of insurance with the help of thegame, in the first level I found myself losing a lot of my money because Ispent large amounts on repairing damages, however I was able to minimise thisin the later stages of the game hence I realised how critical insurance is torisk management and reduction. Research also proved to be an invaluable tool,it gave me a possible glimpse of the extent of the damage a comet could causeand the possibility of it causing a damage, if I were to play the game again Iwould probably focus more on those comets that had a higher probability ofcausing damage to my settlement and ignore the ones that did not.Â Â IfI were to redesign the game I would probably reduce the amount of moneyavailable to the players at a given amount of time for the reason that inreality, in most developing countries where risk management is essential,resources have to be used in a more efficient and stringent way than the way theywere used in the game where the amount of resources were plentiful at times."178.199.176.211,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-37.0 to -13.0,-40.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,22.0 to 68.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,n/a,n/a,"Â This was one very tricky and interesting game with a lotof teaching capacities. How I managed the insurances, information (knowledge)and protection?Insurance: I did not spend a lot of money in insurancein the first level as the investments on the pods were low. Thus, I preferred toinvest in longer term such as protection. However, as the capital value of thepods increased, I preferred to have a higher insurance coverage (75%). This taughtme to balance the expenses of possible floods with minimum expenses. Knowledge and Protection: Each comet had its data onprobability and possible damages it might cause. According to those data I preparedfor the â€˜unknownâ€™. I cases where probability was high with minimum damages, I investedless on the protection while investing more in development, and similarly whenthe probability was very low. Â As theprobability and potential damages became higher I invested on protection morethan development. Thus, I managed to escape floods, and even when I did not thefloods were less intensive causing fewer damages. As a result I had to investless on rebuilding the pods. The game is also created to make us understand how to deal with the intensity of the information coming in. The comet attacks were increasing at rapid pace, those, if not well prepared during 'peaceful' times in the first and second level, it becomes more difficult to cope in the coming levels. I have played the game more than once. In thebeginning, I invested only in development and ignored the risk managementissues to see the impact it will have in the game and vise-versa. Therefore, I learnedthat those factors are interconnected. Development and risk management are directlyproportional and affect each other significantly. Afterwards, I started to paymore attention to the information I was receiving about the damage capacitiesand probabilities of the comets, and based on that information I actedaccordingly. If I had the chance to make one single modification tothis game to improve the risk management I would have added the human factor.Even if the floods are low but citizens are not well informed how to react, thehuman lives would be in stake. Therefore, I suggest to add the public awareness as arisk management tool.All in all, this game has improved my capacity ofbetter analyzing and overseeing the potential risk. In addition to that I havealso learned how to cope and prepare myself to shocks strike. Developmentwithout risk management is not enough. A potential shock might, depending onthe intensity, might bring misery and poverty to those affected. Â Â "188.204.40.241,6.0 to 10.0,4.0 to 5.0,42.0 to 69.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-4.0 to 2.0,n/a,n/a,"Risk Horizon Game: Short Essay.Â The role of risk management in thegame was to ensure that the creation and subsequent development of an Alientown, was not ruined by a major risk (incoming asteroids). Thus, whilstdeveloping the town, risk management was essential in order to not ruin thedevelopment. Many things had to be taken into account, and preparing for thesepossible risks was crucial. Â The first choice I made was to obtainat least basic insurance, as this would protect the development. Commontrade-off were between protection and insurance. I would ultimately make sure Iwas insured, but always try to use the protection bar as much as possible. Themore I was prepared, the easier it was to deal with the effects of asteroids. Thus,development actually become a lot easier. For instance, the researching thepotential threat of the asteroids aspect enabled me to prepare more, andenabled me to make educated decisions about what I should do. Thus instead ofacting on pure conjecture, I could actually make approximations to how exactlythe asteroids would affect my development. Â After the first game, I realised theimportance of this. I had not researched the threats of the asteroids so muchbefore. After the first game though, I did. This allowed me to plan a lot moreextensively and appropriately. Â I live in the Netherlands. So instead of asteroids, the risk would bebased around flooding.

Because each of the different risk management techniques required resources, their use had to be traded against development gains. Each of the risk management techniques also had to be balanced, in terms of the time and resources needed to activate the protection. It was all too easy to get caught out with unprotected costs at the end of the stage, with little time to undertake repairs! The immediate affect on development was slower growth and upgrading. In the longterm, it allowed for progression to the next stage by protecting gains.I played the game more than once. As I played, I understood the role of research better. My approach become this: identify comet, get one or two research points, if it looks like a high risk comet then I continued to research while accumulating funds. I also increased insurance levels.Â I learned from the game the importance of planning ahead, and with information, developing a short term protection strategy and building up buffers to recover from the shock. I also learnt of the capriciousness of the disaster events. Sometimes, despite the best laid plans, your development goals can still be missed.The game has been developed with a single threat and a single measure of development. While this is a simple model of development, I think it would be interesting to add a second type of threat (helping to represent the complex nature of risks to development) or a range of development factors that need to be considered together in unison. For instance, education, health and wealth of the inhabitants of the community. Perhaps the governance of the community could be an additional facet of the game? Different forms of governance could present new barriers, or make certain types of protection more effective. For instance, community support networks could be more effective where a strong civic sense has been created or where governance is responsive to citizens demands."87.212.87.92,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,24.0 to 42.0,29.0 to 62.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,35.0 to 44.0,17.0 to 36.0,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,3.0 to 13.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"REFLECTION OF RISK HORIZON GAMEThe objective of this game is to developa â€˜societyâ€™ on an island. As the decision maker in this game the challenge is tobalance the development of society with managing the risk for meteor impacts.Risk management in this game embodied the trade-off between spending money onprotection and insurance against the effects of meteor impacts, on research onthe chance and severity of the meteor impacts and on the development of societyby building and expanding houses. Each choice had an impact on the other.Protection meant less chance on the risk of meteors actually hitting theisland, insurance meant financial support when an impact did happen andresearch led to more understanding of the risk and therefore more time toaccurately prepare for it.Placingthis game in the frame of the last few lectures helps understanding thetheoretical concept of risk management. Effective risk management in this gamemeant mitigating the damage of property (thus losses) and developing society(thus the benefits). This clearly reflects the goal of risk management. Inorder to achieve that objective, risk management in this game is more than justpreparing for the risk by protection and insurance. This aspect reallyreflected that preparing for the risk doesnâ€™t mean it wonâ€™t happen anymore, youstill need to be able to cope with the risk. In this game coping with theaftermath also impacted the development of society and the level of success inthe game. Playing the game multiple times hasallowed me to learn from previous mistakes in the allocation of money.Developing society meant less money towards protection and insurance and viceversa. However, sound spending of money on protection, insurance and researchmeant more opportunity for solid development. Understanding the reciprocitybetween these trade-offs led to sound decision-making in the allocation ofmoney in order for society to develop despite of the risks of meteor impacts.If I could change anything it would bethe use of insurance in the game. Now it is a â€˜one-time-onlyâ€™ decision per level.But it should reflect the changes in the development of society more as it doesin real life. More property value means more insurance premium. This evolvementisnâ€™t reflected in the game. Therefore I would suggest to change insurance soit isnâ€™t sufficient anymore if the property value has increased too much. Thisallows for a better understanding of insuring your property for its actualvalue against risks.Â Overall, I appreciate this game as a valuable means for understanding the different concepts of risk management and applying these concepts in real life."190.162.8.219,6.0 to 10.0,3.0 to 4.0,24.0 to 42.0,-11.0 to 8.0,35.0 to 53.0,38.0 to 48.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,-28.0 to -15.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-50.0 to -14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"For me, theRisk Horizon Game is a good instrument to understand in a practical way, Â the main concepts of Risk Management presentedin Chapter 1 and 2 of the World Development Report 2014, representing asituation of systemic risk of being impacted by a comet shower.The role ofthe risk management described is not only reducing the negative effects of therisk, but increasing the positive effects, serving as a tool for development.The game presents Â in a very simplified way the Risk Management Model,conformed by Â two phases: the Preparationor â€œex anteâ€ù phase and the Coping or â€œex postâ€ù phase Â and Â three components: Knowledge (actions toimprove understanding of possible shocks and their potential outcomes);Â  Protection (actions to reduce the probabilityor magnitude of losses from negative shocks, or to increase gains from positiveshocks); and Insurance (actions to transfer resources from good to bad times,or to those most in need in bad times), showing the inverse interrelationbetween the two phases and the necessity of having a good balance between thethree components to achieve a virtuous circle. It also demonstratesthat the decisions about Risk Management are based in a cost/benefit criteria,depending on the relative prices of the different options available and thesize of the future shock and the probability of its occurrence.As well as, the game presents the matter of the obstacles for risk management, specifically, the financial constraint.Also, it demonstrates that mismanaged risks originate severe consequences and that proactiverisk management is the right way for managing risks.Finally, thegame shows that Risk Management is a continuous process of learning andcorrecting, what I experienced by myself each time I played the game.The only changeI would propose to better represent the risk management choices in the actual worldwould be to introduce obstacles to Risk Management strategies, conformed bygovernment failure (lack of public resources, coordination failure, amongothers).Â Â Â "59.165.151.3,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,29.0 to 62.0,12.0 to 35.0,17.0 to 38.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,-36.0 to 1.0,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,6.0 to 14.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-5.0 to 2.0,-3.0 to 3.0,"1)The game has an inbuilt system wherein one can find thechances if a comet is going to hit or not and what would be the severity of thehit.

A comet havingno chance of a hit can be avoided and the resources can be directed to thebuilding of pods.2)I played the game several times.

The aimseemed to be to show that you need to choose the best risk management optionsto allow for the most development.

The timer had quite an impact on mychoices, the nearer the end of the round the more likely I was to spentresources on conserving what I had built up in order to hit the qualifying level.Overall in terms of the game, risk management slowed down development, and onlyproved its worth when a shock occurred. I think this highlights one of thechallenges in the real world, in that it is hard to persuade people that themoney/time/resource is well spent until after a shock occurs, until that timethe money is in effect â€˜wastedâ€™.I played that game multiple times and changed how I playedit to see what would happen. Seems like having cash in the bank always makesthings easier, from recovering after a hit to investing in knowledge, protectionand insurance. The main things I learned were that it is easy to forget aboutrisk management (once or twice I got carried away with building the pods), thatknowledge is very useful that it could be deemed a waste of money (for theshocks that had little impact or missed completely), and that theinfrastructure is great if you can afford it.

Likewise, if the buildings faced damage due to falling asteroids, theplayers also lost the game. In terms of knowledge, the players were given theoption to research the planet by clicking on the planet. Through this, theplayers were able to assess the level of damage and the probability of theasteroid hitting the planet. Through this, the players were able to set up amethod of protection or insurance by either raising the platform that thecities were placed on or by purchasing insurance plans that covered parts ofthe repair. However, protection and insurance did take a toll, meaning that itdid affect the rate of development.

In order to protect the community, decisions were required toÂ be madeÂ relating to trade-offsbetween preparing for risk and investing in the development of the community. Preparingfor risk involved the development of protective measures, each of which playeda vital role in the development of a sound risk framework:1.Â Â Â â€˜Knowledgeâ€™ assisted in the understanding ofshocks and the potential outcomes of a comet hit;2.Â Â Â â€˜Protectionâ€™ directly assisted in reducing theprobability and magnitude of loss should a comet hit; and3.Â Â Â â€˜Insuranceâ€™ allowed for the transfer ofresources during good times to assist during bad times so that recovery from ahit was a lot easier and efficient.In a sense, â€˜knowledgeâ€™ helped before the comet hit, â€˜protectionâ€™ helped during the crisis and â€˜insuranceâ€™ assisted in recovery after a shock. I found that if I wasprepared on all these three levels, I was able to easily recover immediatelyafter an adverse development.The first time I played the game, I did not place as muchimportance on research as I did playing the second time. In focussing a littlemore on research, I was able to more effectively protect from the comets andhave more time to recover from a hit. This made quite a noticeable differenceto my overall risk management and allowed me to advance a further 2 levelscompared to my first try.Overall, the primary lesson I learnt from the game was thatrisk management as a preventative measure is vital. Preparing communities forcrises before they happen and investing in what may sometimes seem â€˜low pay-offactivitiesâ€™ (such as research), can substantially help reduce damage andimprove recovery in adverse situations. The game also allowed me to experience first-hand (on asmall scale) certain behavioural obstacles to effective risk management. For example,thoughts such as â€œthereâ€™s a comet coming with high severity and low chances ofhittingâ€_I doubt it will affect meâ€ù ran through my mind during game play. Â Such thoughts illustrate the tendency forhumans to become overly self-confident and downplay the chances/effects ofadverse scenarios. One simple thing I would change would be to add one otherrisk element to the game besides the comets (e.g. add the risk of alieninvasion?). Whilst sometimes communities are confronted with one key risk intheir region, often it is the case that they are susceptible to a risk ofmultiple (sometimes quite large) adverse events. For example, regions in ruralAustralia are susceptible to both flood and bushfire risk, depending on the season.Such communities need to considerÂ trade offs, not only between how much they shouldinvest in risk protection overall, but also how much to invest in protectingfrom each type of risk they areexposed to. "49.205.91.239,2.0 to 3.0,3.0 to 4.0,15.0 to 24.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-33.0 to -11.0,-37.0 to -13.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,12.0 to 22.0,13.0 to 23.0,6.0 to 14.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"The entire game revolved around managing risksand making decisions that were pertinent to keep the development of pods going. The rationale ofthe game was to make sure that the development reaches at a prescribed stage and in order to reach that goal choices have to be made in managing the risks whichwere depicted as comets in the game. The resources had to be utilized in a waythat balanced all the major components of the game i.e the development, protection, knowledge and insurance. Striking that balance between these components and taking timely and informed decisions was the core of the game. I followed the strategy of focusing on thedevelopment first so that it reaches some desired level. After that the focusshifted to protecting the pods by the way of insurance as well as increasingthe height. Simultaneously care was taken in upgrading the pods to ensure thedevelopment is not seeing red. The research provided a lot of information thathelped in preparing for the strike, if the chances of hitting and severity of acomet was low focus was on development and if both were high the focus shiftedto become resilient to, as well as coping with the disaster. Also it was madesure that even if the severity or chances of a hit were low a certain level ofprotection was always there as one cannot be sure of shocks.I played the game multiple times because duringinitial trials I was not able to strike a balance between the aforementionedcomponents and ended up either being focused on development or protection.Playing it several times helped me in analyzing where I was going wrong andhelped me in dealing with them in later attempts.The experience gained form theprevious attempts helped me in coming up with a better strategy in my lastattempt that helped me in reaching the fifth level of the game. The game should have definitely taken intoaccount the amount of resources that a person/community/country can afford inmanaging the risks they face. A choice/random assignment of curator havingvaried amount of resources should have been allotted to bring in the effect oflack of resources that might hinder even the foundation work for managing therisks that they might face.If asked to summarize my learning in three major pointsÂ  after playing the game many times, they would be:Plan: Ad hoc development without proper research and estimation of resources can prove to be a disasterManage: Managing the resources and utilizing them to the maximum is the keyPrepare: Always be prepared for shocks, sometimes they may miss, but they would strike when least expected, so be on your toes"212.96.12.234,0.0 to 2.0,3.0 to 4.0,0.0 to 15.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,"In this game, one never knows when a comet will appear, how many comets will appear and which one will hit. Risk management was important in the sense that it helps one to develop the city at a steady pace whilst withstanding hits with limited resources.In playing the game, I started development at a slow pace up to a point before protecting the development, purchasing insurance and researching on the comet. I then left sufficient funds to repair damages made after a comet hit.The trade off was made between pursuing new development and reserving resources to rebuild in case of a hit.If I played the game once, I would have built a little more faster than before and used more protection so that when the comet hits the damage will me minimal.Â The valuable lesson learnt from this game is that for every development activity that is undertaken, it is imperative to put mitigation measures in place against adverse risks that may occur. On the other hand if one is too cautious, development may be slowed down. One must develop resilience but must also push forward to make good use of opportunities.The game can be improved by giving people a wider range of options to chose from to mitigate the risk such as different types of protection and different types of knowledge gained (research)"179.223.108.15,10.0 to 66.0,4.0 to 5.0,69.0 to 435.0,-27.0 to -11.0,-47.0 to -33.0,-52.0 to -37.0,-56.0 to -40.0,n/a,n/a,-15.0 to 1.0,-13.0 to 3.0,-14.0 to -2.0,2.0 to 11.0,n/a,n/a,"This game at first seems to be very confusing and silly. However after analyzing and playing it a few times, I discovered some tricks and how to do better. These tricks can be called ""planning"". I at first I hired insurance (first level of Â coverage as it seems price wise fair in comparison to others) to cover possible losses and to increase speed of recovery and reconstruction. Doing the analysis on the comet help me to know when to increase the size or height of the island, so that impact could be lower on the pods. It really helped me reach the 4th level. Risk management role on that game is the base on how to move to next level, on how to prevent harmful destruction of the island and the protection of the investment made on it.Â Since it was of common knowledge that the island of was under the attack of comets that could destroy partially or completely the pods and the investment, it was imperative to find ways to protect it, to minimize impact ( specially when comets had high impact possibility that could be found out when researching it) Â and keep funds available to finance then Â a quick reconstruction of the damages.Â It was also clear that increasing the size of the island was not imperative, since after reaching the goal, when triggering the increase button, no power was drained, only cash. So major tasks on the game were:1 - build the podsÂ 2 - insure the islandÂ 3 - research the comments to analyse impactÂ 4 - maintain available cash for reconstruction of island and to invest in developing the podsÂ 5 - increase island sideIf was to change somethings on the game, I would give more power to increasing the island height. Building solid structures, specially in terrains where the possibility of acts of God are high, is imperative, and should always come first, as the example of California and Japan where the buildings are prepared for earthquakes of enormous magnitudes. Â I live in Brazil, so disasters here are not common, but floods, such as one that happened in the state of Santa Catarina a few years ago, when their plan of Emergency preparedness was Zero and no contingency plan. Insurance companies lost millions on that episode due to bad risk assessing from the government that should consider the floods, our game comets. It was a very interesting experience.Â "178.155.243.128,10.0 to 66.0,5.0 to 6.0,69.0 to 435.0,-11.0 to 8.0,-11.0 to 12.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-13.0 to 17.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,3.0 to 13.0,14.0 to 49.0,2.0 to 11.0,-5.0 to 2.0,n/a,"For me, the role of riskmanagement was to find the right balance between protection, research,insurance and fund for development. One must keep an eye on all of the aspectsin order to secure the safety and prosperity for his society. The main tradeoffthat I faced was obviously the delay in the pods development due to resourceallocation for disaster preparedness. However I found that trough research youcan identify and allocate the optimal amount of money to either insurance orprotection. So in my second game I have paid more careful attention to researchand then based on the facts I made my decisions where to allocate funds- toprotection, insurance or both.As stated before, after my firstgame I have tried to base my decisions on facts provided by research. This paidoff, since I was able to allocate resources for disaster protection moreefficiently and therefore I had more money for development of the community. Inthe first game I also tended to neglect the comets with low severity or chanceto hit, in some cases the comets hit my village and they rarely did damage tothe community, but it is a wise idea to be prepared for this little disasterswith insurance or, saved cash for repairs, because despite that the disaster isof a low severity, it causes damage and thus a delay in development. A fact,which could be easily managed and mitigated. Again, it is of crucial importanceto find the right mix of all the variables, since if you invest in some aspectinefficiently this will directly affect the performance of the other elementsin the game. The main things I learned are that a society can be self-dependenton risk management and that decisions must be made on exact data in order tooptimize the spending mix. Good inter society connections allow theparticipants to mitigate the consequences of the disaster with low or next tozero cost.The one thing that I would add tothe game would be a fund with saved money, which must be used only to cope withthe consequences of a disaster. The accumulated amount can be given fordevelopment at the end of the next level. This will act as an insurance, butthe money can stay in the society and, if not used then they can contribute todevelopment. "94.228.207.199,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 2.0,0.0 to 15.0,-38.0 to -27.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,n/a,"1. The roleof risk management in the game was to find the balance between the resources indisposal for enveloping the infrastructure system and their costs in face ofcoping shockâ€™s afterwards. Â It was necessaryto combine the capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to copeafterwards. In thefirst line I paid attention to the protecting measures to lay the first stonein the colony safety.Then I took construction measures and insured my buildings. Certainly it wasvery necessary to do it time-bound and under the taking researching of comets. Like in areal life the whole development of the colony was possible only in complextrade-off-measures. It was very necessary to research an approximate cycle ofplanet life to understand the cycle behavior for â€œpredictingâ€ù the investmentsequence. After the comet-damage the cycle began again for taking protecting and developing measures.Â 2. If youplayed the game only once, it would for me hardly possible to understand theplanet life cycle system and then to develop my strategy. My first playing wasdevoted to get the play rules and to get some experience in planet life-cycle.The main things I learned from the game, was to understand, that a rapiddevelopment without (long term) investment in protection, knowledge, insuranceand coping the afterwards is impossible.3. Forbetter representing the risk management choices that matter in the place I live,I would propose to integrate the weather and seasons changing, that could influencethe behavior of player, the objects and magnitudes in combining with the riskevaluation, shocks depth and coping measures."202.4.59.3,3.0 to 6.0,5.0 to 6.0,42.0 to 69.0,8.0 to 29.0,12.0 to 35.0,-13.0 to 17.0,17.0 to 35.0,-2.0 to 17.0,n/a,1.0 to 12.0,13.0 to 23.0,-2.0 to 6.0,-14.0 to -4.0,-12.0 to -5.0,n/a,"I played the game a couple of times and interestingly got so caught up in the intellectual exercise of it that I am writing this with only a few minutes left to the deadline. It reminds me that it is important to keep in mind all the real world consequences of our decision making. As a development practitioner it is very easy to get too caught up in the intellectual exercise of ""the game"" without thinking about actual impact on lives. I'm not saying the abstract is unimportant it's just important to get that balance right. The first time I played the game I maxed out on insurance coverage every time which allowed me to develop and protect the development of the pods up to a certain point. All of my pods developed to a a level three of four until the funds for developing them further ran out. The second time I played the game I over corrected and didn't buy insurance in the early rounds preferring to rely on research and some high water protection to protect the pods. Again this worked well until a certain level when all of my pods became heavily damaged and there was not enough funds left to repair them in time to meet the development goals. The main thing that I have learned from the game is the level of complexity involved in making these simple decisions. There are only a few variables in the game at the moment and it is still complex to manage get the balance right. The other thing I learnt is that it is important to be always doing something in risk management. In spite of myself I sometimes found myself buying insurance, building up protection and then sitting back and watching to see how it all unfolds rather than remembering toÂ  continue the research process. If I were developing a new version of the game I would try to add some sort of representation of democracy or the governance process into the mix. I'm not entirely sure how yo would do this, maybe introduce a citizen satisfaction meter which would drop if you failed to mitigate a major disaster or spent too little on development. If it dropped below a certain point you would be thrown out of office or there would be a revolution.

Three things is important e.g.research, protection and insurance. Research is important to get informationabout upcoming disaster so that proper planning and risk management can beinitiated for the community. Additionally research is important to develop longterm strategy for example to know frequency and intensity of disaster on therespective community. With this information necessary insurance can bepurchased which can be useful for further repair and maintenance. Butdevelopment of the community is also very important in order to build-up enoughwealth for strengthening protection measures and insurance which ultimatelyboost up existing development initiatives. In this game I put more emphasis onresearch and insurance and continuous development of community (building andupgrading).

Another important learning is thatto build network between community people during disaster. In that situationthey both can help each other and do joint effort to minimize the risk.

Also from the course, I learnt that risk neednot be harmful, however, and is not always a burden. In many cases, peoplehoping to improve their standards of living may voluntarily take on risk.Indeed, risk taking is essential to the pursuit of opportunity. But thoseopportunities may bring their own risks.These values I gained from the Risk Horizon game I played. Atfirst I played for a few times without passing the level 1. This gave meunderstanding of the important of research to evaluate the severity andlikelihood of the risk happen and as such cushioned my resolve and mypreparation to forestall the impending risk.Â I understood from the game that it is often when risks are mismanagedthat the consequences become severe, turning into crises with dire results.Poor outcomes do not always reflect bad risk management, however: extremelylarge and unexpected shocks can overwhelm even the best preparation. Such criseshave damaging effects because they not only affect current living conditionsbut also weaken their ability and willing-ness to pursue new opportunities.Also the planning of resources to mitigate or cope with riskwas also a key factor that I took out from the game.

While playing the game at first, I didnâ€™t get the importance ofbuying insurance, until I saw that it cost me more to repair after damage.Buying insurance help me come back to â€˜status quoâ€™ in the shortest period, withless resources consumed.From the risk horizon game, I learnt that risk management isan essential tool for development because every day we are exposed to manyrisks, and an inability to manage those risks can jeopardize development goals.The Risk horizon game gave me hands on means to plan and manage risks, withmore knowledge on the importance of research, insurance, resources andplanning.On a concluding note, the risk horizon game gave me scope onhow risk could be better used for opportunity. From the game, I learnt riskmanagement may provide a means both to increase economic returns and re-ducethe propensity for crises. This could achieve after mastering the game andutilizing all the available tools at my disposal to develop the pods, with lessdamage as I progressed to higher levels."
