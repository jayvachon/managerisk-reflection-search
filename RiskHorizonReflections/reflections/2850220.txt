1 - I think that one need to find a balance between the 3 aspects mentioned in this week videos. The knowledge is essential while preparing to a shock then, at the beginning I used it as the key factor to succeed but after all I've spent important money on that and I spent also a lot of time only observing the meteors. In the first 2 rounds I was only acting after shock but after a while it was clear that is much worth preparing immediately and do so you need to pay attention in the amount of money to spend with insurance.2 - I played 3 times and I planning on doing more to get a better grade and also to excel myself. I was so focus on getting information about the meteors that I did not buy any insurance in the first round. After that, I managed the insurance coverage with the information about the damage a meteor could do versus the quantity of pods I had. I could only improve my pods to the second stage though. The main message for me was 'balance'. Of course knowledge is very important as well as protection, you can't forget about insurance. It can save your money when coping after a shock.3 - I would add some after shock effects in the planet to make it more similar with a place that had been hit by a flooding. In places like that you can find a great quantity of dirty and cleaning that, if is not take care fast, it will contribute to create more damage if a second flooding hits the place. So I think this way one would have more experience in managing a risk before and coping after a shock.
