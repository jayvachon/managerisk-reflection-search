The game brings to life the importance and role adequate
preparation – knowledge, protection and insurance – plays in forestalling shocks and promoting community development. With adequate knowledge,
the severity of impact is understood and limited by implementing necessary coping strategies. It is also important to note that proper protection and insurance
will require knowledge of past and impending shocks (gained through research
and shared experiences). In contrast, acquiring all the knowledge and not
implementing necessary strategic actions amounts to nothing. That is to say,
with the best of disaster knowledge, impacts can be severe if necessary
protection, information sharing and coping strategies are not implemented. 

Protecting communities that have taken years of effort and
dedication to develop is unarguably essential. Since we cannot prevent every shock, protection goes a long way to limit impacts and an extra protection
goes a longer way. With adequate protection, damages are less, repairs easier
and open opportunities for prosperity. Extra protection is important to overcome deep uncertainties associated with shocks. In same vein, the
importance of insurance for development was played out in the game. Without
insurance, reconstruction becomes difficult and takes a longer time. An essential form of insurance in the game is community cohesion achieved through complete community (pods) development making impact of shocks less or averted.

For effective management of risk, the importance of
financial resource can not be overlooked. As played out in the game, without sufficient
financial resources pods cannot be built, insurance cannot be purchased and pod repairs cannot be made. Thus financial resource is required for developing communities (building pods) which increases
community cohesion and spreads out (reduces) risk. Generally, components of adaptive capacity (risk management) require
some measure of economic capability.

The popular saying that ‘only change is constant’ is true
with risk. Risk changes with time and different for different event or society
so also should risk management. Thus an effective risk management strategy will
involve a constant review of all aspects of risk. Risk management is a ‘never a
dull moment’ management technique. As played out in the game, a Luminator must
be active researching, protecting, buying insurance and building or repairing
pods.

I played the game trice; the first was a total disaster and
I lost at level one. I struggled with the balancing researching, protection and
insurance. The second try was different; I began to understand the principle of
being active at all times during the game and the need to balance the three
preparation strategies. This is similar with real life situations, the first time a
particular type of shock strikes the impacts can be devastating but with
repeat events and improved preparation impacts can be better managed.

Lastly, I feel the influence of added protection for Alora
community on the meter reading to the left of the screen is not commemorated.
If I were to make a change to the game, I will improve the influence protection
has on a Luminator developing Alora community and moving to the next level of
the game.
