In answer to the first question, I would capture it with two words - tradeoffs and synergies. knowledge and protection build on each other while insurance involved some tradeoff.  By taking huge risk cover of 75% resources available for research were significantly reduced, while taking a low cover meant that resources available to reconstruct were not there.  The game captures real life dillema that risk management must entail. In a resource limited settings one has to make tradeoffs in terms of which risk preparation and protection measures to take, while at the same time ensuring that they do not take more risk than they can handle or fail to exploit opportunities because these may come with risks.If I were to play the game again, I would focus more on knowledge creation - understanding more the nature of risk, so as to make appropriate preparation for it. At the moment I still do not understand what would be the ideal level of coverage of the three options. I would also want to understand how investments in research provide risk management value in the game. Lastly in answer to the last question, I would add behavioral components to the game. In Africa, one of the main disincentives for risk management is corruption and poor governance (even though limited resources is also a factor). I would look at how risk management decisions would be affected in settings of different levels of corruption and increased quality of governance. As noted in the class, individual level types of actions (self-insurance) are unlikely to be effective if the risk is of a systemic nature or affects whole communities. Unfortunately corruption by nature distributes resources to the people in power and because of it, a vicious cycle of misaligned incentives for action becomes the mainstream. So I would then look at a situation where one can take insurance cover for 25% of the risk, and reduced corruption of 50% - or indeed different compositions of these two possibly aided by better governance.  Ultimately these are the main determinants of how much risk individuals and communities are willing to take or indeed prepared to exploit opportunities that of necessity expose them to some known or unknown risk.
