As  s manager of the community,I bought insurance,develop protection and making research during this game.while,insurance is the first choice, then use some money to develop protection, if there is some time left, I would like to accumulate research to reduce the severity or the probability of hit.Preparation of risk affect development immediately when the disaster occurs since research let some comet missed, while insurance and protection can reduce the loss of the disaster.During the second time playing the game, I spent more money on developing protection.This effort made me saved a lot of money by reducing the loss of a disaster.When facing a great disaster,buying insurance is not enough,it is of great importance to make mass protection before it occurs,that's what I have learned from the game.If I was asked developing a new version of the game , more choices of protection will be added. For example, the player can make a alarm and move the citizens to a  shelter, during that time , community development stops mounting but community development will become faster after  disaster, while broken structures can recover faster.
