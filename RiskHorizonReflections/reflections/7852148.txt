I believe the risk management on the game was based on keep your colony developing while maintaining it safe from the floods caused by the meteors impact. The hard thing is to research the meteors to know if they actually will fall on the planet and their severity, so you can raise the terrain above that or contract the correct insurance to not short your cash preventing development of the colony.My first attempt didn't got past level 1, because I did not understood the research and the "raise terrain" tool and neither the "mini game" when the meteor hits the planet, so I invest everything on raising it, later I got the impression that raising the terrain was affecting my development increase rate and I was buying top insurance, which held back the number of developments on my settlement because they are a bit expansive, and they do not cover full damage, so I also had to deal with the repair costs of my buildings after the flood.So on my last attempt I decided that Insurance was not the best way to go, and that I did not need to raise the land to the maximum, mostly meteors did not had a red severity and thus I would not need to reach that level of terrain as well, I managed to get so nice development on the first levels but got overprotective on 3rd, again raising the terrain over the needed.Â Overall, the hardest part was to struggle between avoiding destruction and investing cash on development, it was hard to me to get out of the comfort zone (raising the terrain above the needed) because I am like that, so I was unable to go past level 4 because of the timer, which is pretty much an issue I have on real life, I struggle to take some risks because the "damage" of a failure could put me on a very bad situation, which makes me slower, in life and in games as well.I live on Brazil, flooding is a natural disaster we have on some parts of the country, so I would improve the "raise terrain" tool to show a tip of what it actually does, on my first attempt I failed to realised that and we can consider that I falied to "research" better ways to get informed of how to avoid the floods, something that is also not very effective on Brazil, when the flood happens, it is already happening (at least on most places).
