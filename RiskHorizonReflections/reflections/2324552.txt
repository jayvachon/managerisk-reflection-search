The role of Risk management in the game:

The role of risk management in this game is
nothing but the trade-off between the “cost of opportunity (opportunity cost)” and
protection of resources and is always followed by timely action.

The choices
made:

In the game, as the opportunity cost (the
money spent on Knowledge) of “Knowledge” was less and hence I did not consider
it as a part of the trade-offs. But the trade-offs were between Insurance and
protection during the beginning of each level, and I chose Insurance (the
transfer of risk) to protection which worked will. During the course of the
game and during the end of each level, the trade-off was between developing / upgrading
the pods vs protection. For this particular trade-off I used the information
obtained from the “Knowledge” by knowing the impact and probability.

Preparation for risk had direct impact on
development. It stalled the development.Learnings from the game:

I played the game twice. The first time I gave
too much of importance to protection, which in turn stalled growth. The next
time I was able to balance between all these trade-off’s and also was able to
give more importance to community connections.

Things
that can be improved in the game:

The game focused just to one risk and the
strategic management for that risk with help of tools and trade-offs. But in
reality this doesn’t happen. There will be many risks, some foreseen and the rest
not, each occurring at various time periods or the same time period. So the
game could include more risk factors and tools accordingly for better
stimulation of the risk management.
