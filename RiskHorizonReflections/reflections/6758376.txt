It was so pathetic iÂ  could make any meaning out of the game despite tutorials use and help options given. can not tell if my computer user interface is not compatible with the Game. I cannot understand any single thing out of that game let alone relate it with the lectures or materials read. would be glad if i could, in this aspect/category assessed in any other way. Thank you.
