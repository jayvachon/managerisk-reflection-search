1. My Risk Management Experience:Risk management allowed better organize the decisions to maintaining a higher level of welfare. This implied assume it is not possible to focus exclusively on growth and economic development, without considering external factors (often unforeseen) that can affect it. This idea is very important, because there is a permanent illusion that indicates that the only path to become a developed country is maximize the economical logic associated to obtain financial results (especially in not developed countries), without assume that the economical approach is only a single element.Therefore, it has been a key, a proactive approach based on to balance to avoid decompensation arising from possible trade-offs. Based on the above, it has been chosen to ensure -in first place- economic development,but with a strong emphasis on monitoring and research of potential risks. Adequate provision of resources has led to take insurances, and when the level of development required for each stage was achieved, extra resources were used exclusively to improve and maximize protection systems.In a first step, the development was difficult, but as the first obstacles were overcome, it became less complex. This strategy led end the game succesfully. In short, the lesson was that appropriate risk management give groundwork to facilitate the development.2. Main Lessons:In my case, I played more than once. In the first attempt, I put more emphasis on development. However, this was insufficient to manage risks adequately. In fact, in a first moment, the perspective based to confront risks was rather ad-hoc, and the result was very poor. On subsequent attempts I managed to develop a strategy that  assumed risks as a given and imminent. So, I defined proactively research actions, but with clarity about that would not be sufficient by itself to achieve success. Therefore, it was possible to generate a progressive learning process designed to improve decision making and find a better fit between security measures, insurances and protection actions.Therefore, the main lesson to me was to experience that a proactive approach to risk management and a broad vision that does not compromise the development (in a multidimensional view), is needed. This perspective requires differents supports and continuous learning.3. Tip:Sometimes, some risks appears in unexpectedly. Maybe the game could include not forecasted events, that can provide the basis for future learning on risk management. (English is not my native language. Please excuse me if my ideas are not clear.
