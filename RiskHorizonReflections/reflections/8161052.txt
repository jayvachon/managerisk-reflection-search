Risk always remains in human life. It is often difficult to remove all the risks. But it is possible to mitigate the risk. I find basic role of risk management in this game was primarily to mitigate the damage as much as possible. Secondly to cop up with risk was an valuable option. The availability of insurance and technological facilities of upgradation of pods are cop up feature of risk management.The main trade of here is trade of between actually money and risk management technologies.The insurance option here was relatively cheap. it was possible to buy a 50% coverage easily. But that does not ensure quick recovery of the pods.Â  Secondly the upgradation option available is very expensive. The difference among the price layers of upgradations are huge. Think about first upgradation in 178 and second one is in 295.However,there is also trade off between number of ordinary pods and the number of upgraded pods. Knowledge about danger is vital in risk management. But it is not everything. if you do not have money, you can do very little with your knowledge. Still learning from experience is important. Because from repeated feature, you can guess which time it will be severe danger.Playing the game was very interesting. First time i tried to make as much as pods possible. Later i find that managing those is difficult and does not add points as i expected. Later I made few pods and was careful to buy a good coverage and also was careful to upgrade them as quickly as possible. But money I gained was not much as I expected. So i could not do many upogradation because of lack of money. I tried to use the reasearch option. But that was not assuring. It was difficult to ignore any threat.If I am supposed to develop the game, i hope to make insurance option more diversified. in this game when you buy cheap coverage , it is not possible to upgrade it unless you buy a new coverage. I hope to keep their 4 or 5 layer and those are upgradable to one another.
