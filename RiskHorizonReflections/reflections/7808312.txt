1.      
In the game, the role of risk management was to
stop the destruction of pods by asteroids. Asteroids were landing in the sea,
sending waves on my island. I had to make sure the pods could take the hits. I
had to choose between knowledge, protection and insurance. I chose to emphasize
insurance and knowledge at the expense of protection. Preparation for risk
affected development tremendously. Immediately, I was able to withstand shocks
that were hitting. After some time, the preparation helped me recover more
quickly from the risks.

I played the game twice. The first time I chose
to put an emphasis on knowledge and insurance. I found it a good idea except
that I had no protection and it was hard to recover from a big shock. The
second time I played, I chose knowledge and protection with a little interest
for insurance. The second time I played, I went further than the time before. I
have learned that it is important to balance knowledge, protection and insurance
in designing an effective way to prepare and cope with risks. Indeed, to work
with only two components would leave you vulnerable to shocks. A good focus on
the three variables enables you to overcome the risks and maximize your
benefits.

Imagining that I am tasked with developing a new
version of the game allowing me to change or add one simple thing, I would
focus on protection. Knowledge and insurance are quite developed where I live,
along with protection. But it is my belief that same areas of protection remain
under-explored.
