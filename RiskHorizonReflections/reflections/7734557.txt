Dear Reader,I have played the game and found that the role of risk management in the game relied allot on early warning. In this case assessing the danger of each meteor. The trade-off I should have made was reducing the insurance level once the risk of meteors were no longer present. I found that in the game the progress seemed to stagnate when I did not do this. Also the protection factor in the game negatively impacted development. This happened almost immediately. The thing I would do differently if I played the game again is to correspond my insurance level to the knowledge I have at that time. Since I live in a country with allot of water related risks, I would pay extra attention the protection and maybe add some extra features in that area, next to raising the ground. If I had to reflect on this game and the things I learned it is the importance and interdependence of knowledge (pro-action), protection (Repression) and insurance. One might have knowledge of a crisis to occur but if there are no means, or there is no will to act then risk-management is useless. With kind regards,Mark Schutrups
