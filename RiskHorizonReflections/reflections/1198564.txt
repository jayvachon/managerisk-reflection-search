The game is very fun and interesting. I played it a couple of times and came up to the third level, when i had more time id go the whole game. I think it is very instructive for our world because we have scarce resources, and money, and we need to deploy it on three basic things to try to prevent a catastrophe. As in the game, so it is in real life. It is interesting how research reduces potential catastrophe. Also insurance is also helpful, but i thing it is better to invest in more research to do to prevent a catastrophe. Also lifting platform is also in my opinion more useful than invest in insurance, because raising platform can prevent stroke. So i think it is best to invest in basic insurance, and invest in research and lifting platforms max as possible.
