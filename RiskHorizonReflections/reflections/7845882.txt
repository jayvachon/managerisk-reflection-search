In this game,
the role of risk management is to minimize the adverse outcome of risks to the
greatest extent. I chose to buy insurance and gain the knowledge of how server
the upcoming risks are, and the probability of occurrence the risks are in
order to minimize the adverse outcome of risks. If we have good risk management
and preparation, we will get minimal risk and quickly recover to previous
development.

I played the
game three times. The first time I played the game, I bought small percentage
of insurance, but in the second and third times, I bought bigger percentage of
insurance to minimize the cost of recovering. I’ve learned that there a significant
numbers of ways to prepare and minimize risks, such as: gathering all relevant
information about upcoming risks, buying insurance, cooperating with neighboring
  communities, etc.

If I am asked to
develop a new version of the game, rationalize and make the game a bit more
real by not allow the hits of comets to destroy all the property on earth
because in reality any risk or natural disaster will affect or destroy
different places with different severity.
