The game ‘Risk Horizon’ was very helpful in learning
methods, challenges and outcome of Risk Management . Also it gives a very
practical understating of how risk management works and how the
organization/people can take actions so that they can  to effectively execute Risk Management.

In order to keep Alora safe and maintain its development by
protecting the place from Comets and its possible damages I gained more
knowledge about the comets by analyzing the severity of risk, chances of Alora
getting hit  and doing research as a
preventive measure to confront risk 
beforehand itself rather than 
compensating for the loss after the damage. Simultaneously, I also protected
the place according to the observation made in the activities of Comets regarding the severity of the damage.. So the
tradeoff was either to gain more knowledge , research about the risks of comets or  to
protect the place from the damage.  Insurance was the option to save the costs of damage
and to share the cost of loss which otherwise would solely had to be handled by
the community. However, the fund was limited so I had to choose either the
insurance or the number of pods that could have been built to develop Alora.Also there is also time restriction.

The preparation of risk affected the development by causing
less damage to the place which otherwise could have caused a great deal of
loss.  Also it saved time and resources
which would have been wasted while fixing the damage. Likewise, the preparation
also set an example and lessons which can be a used as a precaution measure in
future for development.

I played the game more than once. In the other
attempts,  I balanced time between
learning more about comets and protecting Alora as learning about severity of
the damage helped me to understand the amount of protection need to keep Alora
safe and helped me to buy insurance according to the severity of the
damage.  From the game I  learnt that
understanding the danger of the risk is very important to plan, build
resilience and protect against possible damages especially for the developing
places. Research about the possible risk is very crucial to plan the prepsration and buy insurance accordingly to reduce damage. Likewise, the Risk Management always comes with trade off and we need
to set priorities.

Risk Management choices are very important to confront risk
by taking preventive measures and being able to cope up with the risk
affectively.  The Risk Management game
was very challenging helpful in learning to deal with risks and make rational
choices.In the game I would not change anything. However, in the place I live
I would like to include people’s option while making the choices in risk
management. It is true that in the times of crisis Authoritative leadership is
best effective. But it is equally important to include people’s choices as it
will help to overcome behavioral bias among people and to make them more aware
regarding the risks and outcomes of ineffective Risk Management choices.
