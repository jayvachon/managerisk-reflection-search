Risk management is the process of confronting risks,
preparing for them and coping with their effects. In the game, and in the real
life, we use risk management to achieve resilience in order to build
prosperity.

During the game I have chosen invest in knowledge, because,
as we have seen in this course, knowing what you are going to face has showed
to be the best way to avoid risk. Using the knowledge obtained in the game I
have builded the necessary protection for each situation, avoiding spending
unnecessary cash and saving for the development of the village. I rarely had
paid for insurance, only in situations that I really saw that the damage was
going to be great. The process of development of my village occurred in a
moderated time, always avoiding spending too much saving for shortage times.

My main learning of this game is that mitigating risks is a
really hard process, however, the path for development is paid with both risk
and opportunities. In order to develop or seize opportunities it is necessary to
confront and even take risks.

The game really captures some aspects of risk management,
but, in my opinion, the game would be more realistc if happen to have some
inespectect events, which are unpredictable.
