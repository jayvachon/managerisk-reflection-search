Life is all about making choices and these choices need to
be on the dot in the face of adversity. To make well informed choices one
requires sufficient knowledge which can be obtained through proper research and
learning. This is exactly what we do as a Risk Manager taking charge of the fictional
city of Alora which has the resources and capability to develop but obstacles
prevent it from development. 

                The
basic outline of the game is to build, manage and develop a city in the face of
constant threat of comets. It is risk management in the face of development.  Our basic choices, 

        Are we going
to

1)     
 manage
and subside risk at the cost of development ?

2)     
 stagnate
development knowing for sure we face a risk from comets?

3)     
 develop
boldly by putting in place proper protection and insurance measures?

The primary trade off in the game
as well as in Real life is between Development and Protection.  This trade off is simple to understand from the
very fact that the Development Bar in the game stagnates when we use the
protection slider. Should we invest money in our protection or further
development? As we keep investing our resources for development we
simultaneously need to protect ourselves upto a basic threshold level. By
applying our minds we can determine this threshold level to be 4 to 5 bars in
the Protection slider. This level should protect us from 70% of the comets and
the rest 30% can be overcome with enhanced research to make enough community
connections to mitigate the severity of hit. Insurance is required only when we
assess the impact of damage to be very high especially when comet speed,
severity and chance of hit is exceptionally high. This strategy has allowed me
to spend enough time in developing pods and research to take me upto level 5
but not beyond.  

        Equipping
yourself with knowledge through adequate research , modifying your behavior
accordingly is essential for success in the game and in reality.  A threshold level protection be it in the
game, a new business venture,  projects
etc will aid us in pursuing our development without worrying about risks all
the time. If we are fixated on managing risks then development will stagnate
and growth cannot be seen. Even with adequate protection insurance is needed to
cover the cost of a huge downfall. 
Community connections in real life with banks, society, friends and
government will go a long way mitigating risk to nil and provide us with peace
of mind in our pursuit for development. These are my main takeaways and
learning from the game.

        If
I had played only once, then the next time what I would have done differently
are

1)     
Postponing the insurance purchase until it was
absolutely necessary.

2)     
The long time I spent upfront on Protection
instead of determining the threshold level.

 

Playing more than once

1)     
My ability to effectively research and make
community connections by factoring in levels of research required based on the
severity improved.

In reality, the amount of
research that goes into studying a crisis will give us more knowledge. This
knowledge when transferred successfully to people will change their behavior .
They will be better equipped in the face of looming disasters. This knowledge
coupled with good facilities for forecasting and predicting disasters will help
us optimize gathering of resources and effective risk management  with minimal impact on normal life. Over
protectionist measures will slow the pace of development . We have to find
opportunity in every risk and transform it to benefit.
