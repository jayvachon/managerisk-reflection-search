On the outset,I'd like to recommend the organizers of this course and this game especially for creating such an interesting outline to help enrich the understanding of the concept through this innovative game!Through this game,all the key elements of risk management were applicable in this game and made the things we heard in class so much easier to understand! Knowledge of the prospective risks were gained through clicking on the comets and constant surveillance of this risk increased the chances of coping with it,much like in reality where constant surveillance of a risk in your area or country will help increase safety from its effects.Protection was gained through Insurance and by filling up the protection meter. The time limit added a sense of urgency which unfortunately led to me demise in the game but it taught me that the ultimate use of risk management - in the daily course of life that is - does not come with a time frame and this is a really important thing that has to be considered. Without this protection, if the task was to develop only, the game would have not been realistic as for every task there are certain risks attached to is. It gives a sense of perspective as well as keeps the player in check throughout the course of the game.The insurance that had to be bought using the dollars earned heavily reduced the risk of attack by the comets and also provided for some development to remain constant unaffected by the comets. It played a very important role as it on one hand limited the damage and on the other,aided in further development by reducing the cost of further repairs. If I played the game again, I would consider developing at a slower pace in the first level and spending more time on research and protection measures as this would help in the long run. If I were to develop this game, I would not change it around much as it is in a good place as it is. I would just add a few tweaks which make the buttons movable which will help those people who play the game on smaller screens. The fixed position of the layout makes it difficult to keep track of all the elements of the game at once.All aspects of the game were in sync with real life situations and with the elements of risk management that are protection,knowledge and insurance and it was a thoroughly entertaining learning experience!Thanks once again for developing this game to integrate it with the course!
