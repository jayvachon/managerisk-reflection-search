The role of risk management in the game was to create a balanced management system that will help to develop pods civilization. The main components of the risk management are knowledge,protection and insurance. In the game we had a scarce resources as money and time so in order to create an efficient risk management we had to balance this three components. During the game I had mentioned that there were different types of meteorites and for the best preparation to prevent risk we had to research them and the more we obtain knowledge about potential negative event the more we can protect the environment. Preparation for the risk affect development after some time, not immediately. We have to spend time and money to create a good risk management system. The fist step that we have to do is to collect data about possible negative event (risk). Risk events consists from 3 components: severe,possibility, research. The risk event can bring a small damage,but the possibility that it occurs can be large or can bring a disaster with small possibility. We have to constantly analyze risks, on the first step of analysis the uncertainty is the most, but the more we analyze the more confident we become about the event and the better protection system we can create. I've played a few times this game and I had change the policy from the first time. I had made more research about meteorites and If I saw that damage can be severe I had chosen the big insurance and vice versa.I think that the main problems in risk management can be with knowledge. The data had to be proven and correct, because if we use wrong information we will take big losses. That is why we have to check information that we know about event, we have to check what are the resources. In Russia there are good mathematical tools in risk management, but we have problems with data.
