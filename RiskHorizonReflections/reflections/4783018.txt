Reflections from Risk HorizonThis game illustrates the relationship between development and risk management, and as development increases, so does the need to protect what has been built.  At the beginning of the game, I steadily built my community and kept insurance low, yet used knowledge on comets - in terms of time, severity, and the likelihood of a hit - in order to inform decisions on when to build and when to protect.  When a hit was "certain", I invested more in protection and upgrades to the pods to prevent damage; and if severity was high, I bought additional insurance.  I found that more insurance helped when I needed it.  It was much faster and easier to rebuild as those costs were low and I was able to afford it.I played the game several times with the intent of striving for balance between development and risk management, and found that it was difficult to get consistent results.  I observed that it was difficult to progress beyond level three if there was little development.  Nevertheless, I found that there was a lot of uncertainty in the game and could not figure out a distinct formula to win the game.The one thing I would change about the game would be to provide a synopsis of why I didn't progress to the next level once that happened.  I did not understand the specifics of what made me "lose".  Therefore, I would find it valuable if I were to learn from my mistakes in a more direct manner and apply those lessons in subsequent attempts of the game.  I think a similar synopsis that outlines best practices in balancing development and risk management would provide value and matter a great deal in the place where I live, where communities often build subdivisions in flood plains that are susceptible to damage if or when something goes wrong.
