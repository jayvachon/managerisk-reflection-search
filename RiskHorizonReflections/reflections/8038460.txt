     Risk Horizon was very interactive and educational, helping me understand how to manage risk under wealth and time constraints while at the same time developing the island of Alora. The role of risk management here was to prevent and lessen the costs of repairing damage caused by the comets hitting Alora. This was done through research, protection, insurance, and community connections. During the game, I had to make several choices, including whether to spend my wealth on upgrading existing pods or developing new pods, whether to spend my limited time on protection or research, and whether to take a chance and develop/upgrade a pod or wait until the comet attack is over. Some trade-offs I made were balancing research with protection and protection with insurance. Preparation for risk affected development in several ways. First, whenever I spent money on protection, the bar's color would turn redder, meaning that my development wasn't going well. However, protection, research, insurance, and community connections also prevented and lessened the damage of the comet attacks, benefiting development.      I played Risk Horizon several times. After the first time, I took more chances in developing and upgrading pods, as I realized that only that helped fill the bar. I also took more time to research, as that helped reduce damage from comet attacks.There were several things I learned from this game. First, I learned that managing risk is every bit as important as developing. Second, I learned that if not consciously worked on for some amount of time, things such as protection get downgraded. Third, it is worth the time to do extensive research, as data becomes more accurate as you spend more time researching it. Fourth, insurance greatly reduces the costs of repairing damage and thus is beneficial to coping. Lastly, I learned that despite so many comet attacks, my end goal is still to develop the island, so I must take chances to develop and upgrade pods.     If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would like to change many things to make it more realistic. However, limited to only one thing, I must choose. In California (where I live), we are especially prone to earthquakes. However, unlike in Risk Horizon, we cannot see the earthquakes coming with our naked eyes. We must use all kinds of advanced technology to sense them the slightest bit. In fact, we even have specialists that do just that, and they get payed for it. As a better representation of the risk management choices that matter in the place I live, instead of being able to see the comets in plain view and getting free research, there should be something along the lines of a comet detector/specialist in the corner of the view port that you have to pay for to get research. Comets should be seen just seconds before they crash. This change makes the game much more realistic.
