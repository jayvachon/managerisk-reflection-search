Since I reached only the 2nd level of the game, I could not fully see the full payback of my investments but from the first two levels I could clearly see that the more you develop (the undeveloped plots), the more secure it becomes. My first priority was to develop the plots and then tried upgrading them one by one. I also tried to raise the ground level though the power costs were high, it was necessary to ward off some of the challenges I thought. Â Managing the funds available was key throughout the game and the time available always stacked up against it, found it quite a challenging task. But I also learned that even upgrading of the plots to second degree did not help in preventing or even minimising the severity of the comet attacks on the land. I thought upgrading would help reduce the severity of the attacks but that was not the case I found out.Playing it only once, I would try to develop as much plots as possible because I understood that was the basic thing I needed to do. Upgrading the plots would be the second thing I would do, if I played this game more than once, that would give all the plots additional protection - at least that is the only option available in the game functions though as I have written above, I found it was not always the case. Raising the ground level is another option I would always consider because that adds another protective layer. I have learned a few things from the game, like optimizing the resources available is critical to creating a protective environment all around. Funds available and allocation of the funds to the different geographies, researching on the comets and the severity and scope of its attacks, raising the ground level etc were all tasks that needed juggling.If I were to improve the game functions and improve the risk management targets or options available, I would add a tool to upgrade the buildings to withstand comet attacks on the land, somewhat similar to the the lightning  thunderstorms or earthquake resistent buildings being built all over the world. That might cost a little higher than the normal upgrading of the plot obviously, but then it would give the participants options to invest in technologies available that could give better protection. Buildings in Japan for instance have these flexible structures and earthquake resistant construction technologies that prevent them from collapsing at the first instance of a possible earthquake. While severe attacks might eventually pull them down, at least at the initial stages, it gives the occupants a chance to leave those buildings as much as possible. A similar technology upgrading and not merely upgrading per se might give this game a more interesting aspect.
