Hi all,In my opinion the main point of the Risk Horizon game was the importance of insurance. First time i played the game, i just wanted to develop, so the money that i give to insurance was too much and i just bought level 1 insurance.. But after the meteors that hit, i run out of money to repair my pods.In my second try i also gave my attention to the insurance and development both. And in all hits, i saved a lot. So basicly, i got that insurance is one of the key points of developing. Because sometimes it doesn't matter how you are protected, (As meteors (: ) you have to be hit, but if you have the insurance it will be easier for you to return your past life before the shock.
