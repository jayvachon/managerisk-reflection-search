1. Risk management is essential to minimize the potential adverse impact and keep the plan (business/devleopment) on track. It also saves resources for other purpose (investment/development). My choice in the game was to identify and analyze risks as much as I can through broadening knowledge. Based on the information I have, I can select choice that have risks, and utilize mechanims or tool to deal with that risks such as buying insurance or building protection. Preparation for risks affect development in a number of ways. First, it can shape the direction of development in a way that involve fewer risks. In pratice, this can be in the form of resilient growth or development because if shocks materialize, the country can have resources and mechanims to deal with the shocks. 2. I would plan the development while understand about risks as fast and as much as possible. Once risk is identifed and analyzed, the protection and insurance needs to be in place to deal with potential shock. The main thing I learned from the game is the resource moblization both in terms of time and wealth is very important for the development and related risk management. Effiecient resource moblizatin for a specific targeted need information, knowledge, and effective decision/judgement. 3. I would add the "unknown unknown" factor. In real world, especially in developing countries, given the limed quality data, capacity, and governance issue, a bit of " unknown unknown" factor could shape gameplayer to give more importanc to insurance and protection.
