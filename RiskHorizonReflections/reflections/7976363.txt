In the game, the role of risk management was to create community connections and improve their protection in order to prevent or mitigate comets chocks. My choices - based on information about severity, chance of hit and research regarding the comets - were related to raising the isand and increasing the pods protation to avoid their damage. A massive and ongoing investment on comets shocks prevention redounded to security for the island. After playing the game for the first time, I started investing in growing the community connections, preparing them to the comets shocks and raising the islands. Therewith, the damage due the hit was 0% and I didn`t have to invest in pods repairment. In conclusion, to invest in risk management, such as protection, avoid negative impacts and high costs to repair the damages. If I could change something in the game, I would add the stakeholders involved to make decisions and improve the risk management.
