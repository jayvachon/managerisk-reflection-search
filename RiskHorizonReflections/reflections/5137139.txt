This game is very helpful to understand the importance of
preparing for risk and to get familiarized with the field of risk management. Furthermore, this game introduced the importance of  balance between risk preparation and healthy
development and how this balance help us support the growing of our community and preparing for potential risks or shocks.  Proactively
dealing with risks can open the way to sustained progress. Failure to prevent
and prepare for risk has tragic consequences as I realized from the game. Preparation
for the risk as we see in teh game involves  a combination of three actions:Research/ Knowledge: gathering information and
increased knowledge is an essential component of risk management. During the
game at the beginning of the game I did not realize the importance of research,
after first try I have realized that the more research we do the more accurate
information become and severity and chance of hit become less thus even if  the damages happen they were manageable when we had good knowledge. Protection: this lowers the probability and size of negative
outcomes.  I used to postpone protection
till further phases in the game however I realized that it is more cost-effective and have better impact when we do the protection at early stages and the more we raise the protection bar the more we
prevent pods from being damaged. Even when damage happen as we cant prevent the damage/ risk 100%,  It is much easier and faster to repair protected pods than
unprotected ones. Insurance: no matter what protection measures we take we can't
completely eliminate the risk of negative outcomes ( shocks in this case) thus insurance can help us
rebuild and repair pods with cheaper cost.  Insurance also helped recover lost development
time after my pods are repaired. It is also worth mentioning that as it appeared
in the game insurance is to be obtained at early stage and not after the shock
happens as it becomes so expensive and does not have same benefits as buying it
at early stage. 







By using these three powers with the perfect balance; research,
protection and insurance and at early stage, we can create a healthy community. This games proves that with good preparation only minimal coping mechanisms might be needed to recover leaving more resources ( wealth) for reducing vulnerability to future shocks.
