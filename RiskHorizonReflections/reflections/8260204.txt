Risk management had a major role in this game. The risk of meteors causing damage to the buildings had to be managed throughout the course of the game. My main protection against the meteors came from using the slider to raise my land. This way, even if a significant meteor came in, my city wouldn't be damaged. Using this approach to negate damage, I didn't have to invest a lot of money into insurance because there was minimal damage to my buildings. I raised the land to the minimum level needed for protection because I used all remaining money to build and upgrade my buildings. If I chose to prepare for risk before developing buildings, immediately after I wouldn't have as much money to use to upgrade the buildings. Over time, it paid off to invest in protection because it prevented me from spending more money on repairs and insurance.I played the game all the way and beat Level 4. On my first attempt I tried investing a lot of money into insurance and raising my land, but ended up with too little money to build or upgrade my buildings. As a result, my progress suffered. After trial and error, I learned that it was beneficial to build a lot at the beginning to establish a strong source of revenue. I learned that this revenue was best spent by first upgrading the buildings evenly and then raising the land whenever possible and as needed to protect from incoming meteors.If I developed a new version of the game I would implement multiple building types. Instead of using one building type that has a basic upgrade track, I would create two building types: one that would have a higher protection factor but produces less money, and another that has a lower protection factor but creates more money. This would represent the choices people make where they live in buying homes or things that have low risk (high protection) and low reward (less revenue) OR high risk (low protection) and high reward (more revenue).Thank you.
