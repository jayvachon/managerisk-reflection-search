The game was difficulty to comprehend initially, after several missed trials I then understood that the more risky behaviour I undertook the more I seem to be more successful. I had to trade off the available fund to gain more protection. The more I became knowledgeable about the situation the more I am encouraged to do more. Researching into the frequently occurring phenomena would have also helped. When  funds were low insurance was taken to help meet the pressing needs. Adequate preparation of course helped to move development forward and also to consolidate on past gains. This happened in the immediate and the near future.The game was played more than once, with time I seemed to be more confident and took more risk to enable me achieve my goal. I learnt that persistence and focus, building on previous knowledge helped. The issue of warning signal before the shocks was not properly addressed. Although, natural disasters do not give adequate warnings, but technology has improved to the level of giving a lead time before the event. These were not captured in the game.
