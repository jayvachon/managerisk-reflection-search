Risk management
allowed one to make slow but steady economic progress.  By doing research I obtained information
about the severity and the likelihood of potential threats.  That information allowed me to immediately
start protecting the developments that were underway.  Additionally, by expending resources to
obtain knowledge, start protective efforts and purchase insurance, I was able
to reduce the potential of harm and the extent of any harm that did occur.  However, effective risk management came at a
price.   Preparing for risk by engaging
in protective efforts consumed my time and took me away from creating
additional developments to increase economic activity.  Additionally consuming resources by
purchasing insurance decreased my ability to develop new properties.  In other words, preparing for risk affected
the pace and extent of development. 
Preparing for risk management forces one to trade off risk management
efforts versus the amount of development. 




 After playing the game the first time, I
realized that I needed to use my budget to start as many developments as
possible.  Engaging in several rounds of
the game taught me that it is important to use ones resources to purchase a
significant amount of insurance as soon as possible as well as increase ones
protective efforts fairly early during each round.  This would enable one to focus afterwards on
using knowledge to anticipate shocks as well as spend a sizeable amount of time
developing properties.  The game also
seemed very realistic.  One was forced to
evaluate the likelihood and severity of a threat in order to decide whether one
was going to engage in protective efforts and/or buy insurance versus spending
resources on development.  As one went to
higher and higher levels of the game, it seems as though one needed to take
more and more risk by delaying protective efforts and building more
developments.  I believe this risk taking
was necessary to be more successful at the game.  

 

The game did not seem
to offer a convenient way to get communities to collaborate to protect
development.  Maybe I did not understand
how to operate the risk management tools but I was unable to get communities to
collaborate to protect from risk or minimize the impacts from risk.  Living in the United States provides me with
a tremendous amount of resources and well developed communities.   Communities here would benefit tremendously
by increase the risk sharing within and between communities.  While it may be difficult to reflect the
complexity and likelihood of successful collaboration between communities, it may
be more realistic to include that feature in the game or to make that feature
easier to use if it is indeed in the game.
