For the development of the community, the game provides permanent parallel choices of risk management between information (research), protection and insurance. However, the initial choices influence the future development by offering opportunities (possibility of gain) or increased risk (possibility of losses). As a result the trade offs made all along this game protect the community from damages or expose it to setback in the development of the community. 

Insurance where risk is transferred is good to a certain level depending on the value of assets and the severity of the disaster. However, too much of it prevents other investments in infrastructures (building and protection- measure of reduction of risk for the latter) slowing in turn the development and therefore reducing the pace for development as it produces less value to reinvest in research and protection.  The better the balance is between the different risk management strategies, the more opportunities are offered for development while also reducing the power of obstacles for losses. Thus shorter periods of recovery due to increased resilience of the community can be noticed. It is also noted that while the community development has to be homogeneous so that wealth is shared amongst the whole community, it does not mean that the whole community has to progress at the same pace. The rapid investment in one sub-community allows for quicker and more return on investment that then allows for quicker development of the less developed ones.
In my experience of the game, played several time, the increased used of research has provided me with the right level of information not to invest too much and too quickly in insurance and protection. I have therefore been able to invest quicker in more sub-communities, and I also learnt to develop these at different paces (to wait that they are all started to start the second phase of development. However after some time I also noticed that I was getting too much information to the detriment of more development. Indeed I realised I was investing too much in research for some comets (high severity and high level of certainty) that prevented me to increase my protection level. Finally, should the game take another dimension into account, I would suggest to consider the level of exposure. Indeed the quality of the building (material used, norms for quality) or the distance to the shore of a sub-community could be considered, as they would not be affected in the same way.
