I think in this game, risk management is about how to use limited resources (money) to get a balanced result (protection and development). I played the game several times, at the first time, I bought the insurance at the very beginning of each level and only built 3 of the pods and kept developing them first. This strategy doesn't work for me since buying insurance lost money which could be used for development or building new pods. For the second time, based on the knowledge of severity of attack, I chose the protection level matched to severity and didn't buy insurance at all. Most of the time, this strategy works, however, the knowledge is not accurate enough (uncertainty) sometimes. I tried to use two different strategies, one is buy insurance, the other is increasing the level of protection and making protection higher than the predicted severity. Both of them worked in some way, From the game, it is quite obvious that if we can protect well without vigorously affecting development, we can pass the level for sure. Once the damage occurred, it is very hard to recover, especially if the damage happened in later stages. Buying insurance would help recovery, but the effect is limited. I feel like good preparation is the best way to reduce damage and for overwhelming damage, insurance is necessary. In the game, it is hard to determine when would be a best time to buy insurance. Just as in reality, insurance won't be executed for approximately half of the times. Also, I found that if I build more pods at the beginning and even though each of the pod won't develop very fast, but the overall green bar grows faster in this way(compared to less pods with higher levels) I think this may implicate that the wider-coverage protection with lower level would be more effective than partial protection with high level. If I would developing a new version of the game, I would make what factors influence the speed of green bar more clearly.
