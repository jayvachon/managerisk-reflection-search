hello everyone i am Aditya Jain , a student from India. So the first question is about how the game is related to risk management. I feel risk horizon,the game, is more about having to face a trade off between gaining knowledge about the risk,protecting yourself from the risk, insuring and developing the city as a whole and also coping against the adversities of the risk in this case the meteors causes to the city. So the trade off i faced was mostly between developing the city and protecting it against the risk caused by the meteors. so the first thing i did was insuring the plot and then start developing aid protecting the city simultaneously. But the major trade off i faced was gaining knowledge about the meteor.Â Now coming to the next question, yes i did play more then once.Actually,i played 3-4 times before i reached level four.the first time i played the game, i did not even reach the second level because all i did was protect the city and develop it a bit here and there. So the first thing I learnt was the fact that i had to strike a balance between protecting , insuring and developing the city because they all worked hand in hand.Gaining knowledge about the meteor was last on my mind. All i did was click more the meteor and check the severity and forget about the meteor and this was the biggest problem i faced and it costed me a lot at times because i did not know how to prepare myself against the possible adversities caused by the meteors. Now the last question, the one thing i would like to change was the knowledge about the meteors. If there was a possibility of making the severity of the meteors available then it would have helped me to strike a balance between gaining the knowledge about the meteors, insuring ,protecting the city, developing the city and also coping with the adversities caused by the meteors.Thank You.
