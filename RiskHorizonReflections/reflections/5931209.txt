The role of risk management in the game
was preparation before the shocks occurs and coping afterwards. Basically, the
community while developing should be able to prepare with the possible
potential shocks and coping with the afterwards. The choice I have made is
confronting the risk. By confronting the risk I mean help the community to gain
knowledge, get assurance, protection and copying the afterwards. The
preparation for risk affected the physical and financial assets of the
community.
If I have to play the game again I will balance the allocation of my resources.
I will not spent the community resources in assurance and forget the
development. I will work for the preparation for risk and focus on the development
of the community at the same time.
What I will propose is at the end of game it should not be about loosing or
gaining but the player should be to understand the real implication of all his
action to the development of the community. For example if I allocate to much money
on assurance, at the end of the game it should not be about gaining or loosing
but I should be able to see the real implication of allocation much money on
insurance to real life and development of the community. I mean the positive or
negative impact in the community development
