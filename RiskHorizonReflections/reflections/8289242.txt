Hi, I am Kien,  I am 27 years old I live in HaNoi, VietNam Despite not having enough time to
take part in many activities, I really like social activities, I want to help
poor people when having opportunity. And my goal is getting the certificate of
rick management in order to improve myself in managing rick to pursue opportunity.   I would like to thank the course and the
course’s designer,  because this course
gives me so much information and knowledge about the rick, and how to manage
rich for development, include confronting and coping with rick  to pursue the opportunities. When playing the horizon game I found
that If you want to pass the game, firstly, you should read the instruction carefully
and try on tutorial to understand the way that the game go on. Moreover, you
can flexibly use the tools which can prepare, confront and cope with ricks when
it occurs.   After reading the instruction carefully,
trying on tutorial and playing the horizon game many times, I have already
finished this game with lever 5.  I feel
the game is the good example for the rick management and it teaches you how to
distinguish the components of rick management : knowledge, insurance,
protection, and coping, and how to balance them to get the effective rick
management . Because if you want to develop your community to get enough wealthy
to reach required level,  you have to not
only pay attention to develop the community, but also  concentrate on protection, insurance, and foercasting.
The most important thing you must do after forecasting the probability and the intensity
of the hitting by the comits is developing the communication among the parts of
your communities. On that way the protection can be increased, and the nagetive
effect of  the shocks to communities will
reduce to low lever, it will even be equal to 0 if you get enough time to
forecast the shocks and do well with the communication among the communities. It
is obviously shown the link between preparation and coping with rick. At the beginning, I don’t know how
to confront with the shocks, because I don’t know how to increase the
protection by the communication of the community, and I feel this game is so
difficult and I don’t want to waste my time on this boring games. When I  understand the role of the game and the usage
of the tools for ricks management i will feel the game is not difficult but so
interesting. It made me understand that : rick is everywhere not only in the
game but also in real life and can occur anytime, so that we have to be always
ready for confronting rick . Proactive, systemic ricks taken is the only way to
overcome rick and pursue opportunity.   Finally, I would like to thank the
course designer again and I will try my best to finish the course with the
highest point I can do. That course (including the game) is  interesting and helpful, so I will introduce
the course to my friends who cares about the things like me. Sharing opinions
and the ideas about rick management through individual can help many people get
the knowledge about managing rick and volunteer search information about rick.
On that way it can make a great achievement in rick management for many
communities around the world:  the
awareness of  rick of the
communities  all around the world  will be higher and higher, so the effect of
negative shock will be lower and lower.
