Initially I was thinking only of getting the pods built without much insurance and protection, then I realized that every time a meteor hits the water and damage is caused I was losing more to rebuild than the insurance and protection which I could have taken at the highest level. The role of risk management is explained in this game where it shows to be better prepared than face dangers which can come unexpectedly at any point in time. If I had played the game only once then I would have understood to invest in insurance and protection first before building pods. As said, I would invest in protection and insurance first before getting pods built and also upgrading them as we go along, so they are more stable in years to come. The main thing which I have picked up from the game is "be better prepared as you would never know what might hit you".If I had to do any changes to this game, it might be building walls around and getting launchers to destroy meteors.
