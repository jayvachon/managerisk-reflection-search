Risk Horizon is giving an insight on how individuals or communities or even a state managed risk.Â Based on what we have learn before from the lectures, there are three key components in creating or coping an effective risk management that are implemented as the main gameplay in Risk Horizon:Knowledge or information, by studying more of meteorite (disaster) that will come in the future or will take place, we may identify the probability and severity of the disaster. Moreover by analyzing and identifying the impact of the disaster and the potential loss that may arise from it, we could determine which mitigation path or finding the right balance to overcome the disaster. But when I analyze the meteorite to much, I have less time in developing my settlement and protection level.Insurance, by applying insurance we could reduce the impact or loss following the disaster. I found out that buying insurance in the Risk Horizon create the most satisfying effect in reducing the impact of disaster. Through insurance, in my opinion, risk management will attain the cost effective objective.Protection, by lifting up the settlement, it provide a mitigation when disaster impact, but cost more and take more time than insurance. Nevertheless when the protection level is high, the impact of disaster could be reduce significantly if not nullified.In general, the idea of Risk horizon is trying to embrace the key components of risk management, based on our choices whether to lean more toward insurance or protection we need to cope with the impact of our choices, a great mixture of both will produce a positive impact on the communities and creating resilience and resources (prosperity).When I played the game for the first time, I lost the game, because I cant fill the bar fast enough and only focusing in creating high protection level, furthermore I do not spend enough time analyzing the meteorite and my resources. The next time I start the game, I aim to build more colonist house to fill the bar faster and buy insurance to compensate my low protection level against the disaster while gradually upgrades the protection throughout the game to mitigate the impact of the disaster, the approach takes me to reach level 4.My feedback or addition to the game is that, the game needs to disclose how to get the resource and there is no apparent way to know which action contribute to increase in resources. It will be a good idea to add some economical/resources maker structure for example farm or mine where resources is extracted, it will also give the player to think furthermore/creating trade off whether to prioritize creating a big settlement first of create a extensive resource network, in the end which will player prioritize using the risk management component.
