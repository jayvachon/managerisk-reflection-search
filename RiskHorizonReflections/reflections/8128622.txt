In the
game, the role of risk management was to fight against natural disasters,
represented by comets, by managing research, protection and insurance in a
limited time.

I choose to
give priority to research and protection, continuing the development of the
community in order to improve its wealth constantly and as quickly as possible.
Indeed, when protection is strong enough, there are no damages, so insurances
are useless, and we know how strong the protection has to be thanks to the observation
of comets and by accumulating knowledge about the dangers.

This
strategy was sufficient to win the level 3 of the game, but I think, in a
longer run, I should have bought insurances, because it's possible that after a
certain time, a more dangerous comet or several comets fallen at the same
moment would have destroyed protections.

Risks are
smaller when people get more knowledge about their real level and possible
impact. This enable the community to prepare itself for natural disasters by
building protections and coping. These protections save the wealth of the
community and it can continue its development on this basis. When the community
loses an important part of its wealth in a dramatic shock, then there is a
rupture in development, and it can't continue as well on the same basis.
