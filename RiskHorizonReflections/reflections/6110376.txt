1. Risk management plays a major role in the game.  Due to limited resources, a well balanced risk management strategy allows a healthy community to be built and protected.  In order to make trade-off decisions, I assessed severity of approaching comets.  Then, I assessed chance of comet hitting.  When severity was low, I tried to raise the island and boost my protection.  When severity was high, I purchased appropriate insurance plan and accumulated research.  Preparation for risk can affect development in two ways.  First, preparation for risk can prevent pods from being damaged and so the community can be developed without any interruptions.  Second, preparation for risk can reduce severity of shocks.  Therefore, the community may suffer only minor setbacks and may rebuild quickly and cheaply.2. After playing the game a few times, I allocated my limited resources differently.  I learned to pay attention to multiple variables and assigned priority to those variables.  The main thing that I learned from the game is that risk management requires assessing the current situation and prioritizing risk management techniques in each situation.   3. I would label the meter in the game; e.g. 25%, 50%, and 75%,  so that the meter displays progress in a clear manner.
