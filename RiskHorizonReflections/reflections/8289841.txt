Risk Horizon game I an interested game.  It helped me to know how and why risk
management is important for development. 

First of all, risk management help player can reduce the
damage from the risk, they still have resources for growing. In this game, risks
are meteors.  

To manage the risks, I used three tools: research, protection
and insurance. I often bought insurance when I started every level, and after
that, with each meteors,  I researched
and used the result of the research to decide about my next protection. 

                Insurance
covered part of my repair cost and replace part of my lost development. With protection,
my pods were prevented form being damaged. And with each reseach, I received
more time to create community connections right before the comet hits, helping
boots my protection. 

So, if my task is developing a new version of the game, I support
that the game need detail information about damage of each meteors. It will
help player in deciding which tool of risk management they will use.
