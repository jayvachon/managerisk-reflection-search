The risk management in the game was basically to develop new pods as well as protecting them from  comet collision shock effects.It was a trade-off  in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance .One had to optimally balance the pod development with the protection of these pods through Insurance  protection which had costs involved.Hence to keep the costs in check one had to do research about the incoming comets and hence balance upgrading pods or building new ones with the entailing costs of taking protective steps or insurance. Initially in level one i would start building new pods with simultaneously increasing protection level to about 60 %.Then immediately after would do research on comets to check severity as well as chances of hitting and depending on the research of couple of incoming comets would then decide on how much to take insurance. Basically would go for 50%.Also one should build new pods but also keep upgrading them simultaneously.This strategy helped me clear both levels.Also after the end of each level one should read the suggestion displayed from which one could make better strategy for the next level. I played the game couple of times.It was difficult  for the first time as the instructions were too little regarding how to start and also how to use slider for protection as well how to purchase insurance.Once i got the hang of it, playing the game was easy.Obviously i could not clear even level 1 first time as i could not deploy the risk management strategy in an effective way.But subsequent attempts were indeed better as experience of failure led me to better strategize regarding how much insurance to take as well as how much to protect depending on comet research,meanwhile creating  upgrading pods simultaneously.Hence my further attempts took me past level 3 easily but not level four.would keep on trying till i get past level 4.The game is very good but a basic one.I would have preferred some more risk management tools incorporated at the game level such as means of deploying say a missile to blast of the comet or instead of raising the island alone as part of protection, one could have option of creating protective domes on each pod vis a vis the related costs involved.But in he end, one does feel after playing the game,the implication of trade offs involved in risk management on one hand and continuous development of the community on other hand which is core to the societal welfare especially in Least Developed Countries  where there is huge capital shortage. Overall the game does reflect the risk management process to development.
