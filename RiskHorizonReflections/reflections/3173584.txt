The role of risk management in the game was the ability of taking calculated risks by taking all factors into consideration. The Risk Horizon game for me was mainly about how an individual take risks taking into consideration the money he or she has to spend. The insurance was a key factor which determined my risk taking ability in the game. The insurance played a part when the meteors did damage.
After playing the game the second time I observed that the first time I played I hadn't taken insurance, however, after taking the insurance I observed I played the game with a little more ease knowing the fact I have insurance and I could take a few risks.
If I were tasked with developing the  game I would definitely have a radar or an alert system to detect the meteor and ensure that I am prepared for what is coming next.
I am currently in Africa(Republic of Benin) and the city is Cotonou which is located on the coast line. The city is exposed to natural disasters such as a cyclone or a tsunami and they have thousands living on the beach and they do not have an evacuation plan or a disaster recovery plan in case a natural disaster occurs.
