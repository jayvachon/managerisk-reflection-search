In the game we had to fill a development bar by building and upgrading pods. Each pod helped to increase a rate of development. A risk in this game are the comets that strike the planet and cause a damage to the pods and hinder the development of the planet. Every comet had a severity and chance of hit. The longer we research a comet the more accurate the predictions become. In the game we were also able to insure against shocks and Â increase a protection. When I played the game a researched only those comets that had at least 50% of chance of hit in order not to waste time, as it was impossible to research all comets. I didn't use insurance as it covered max of 75% of repairing cost and after building and upgrading most of the pods it was very expensive to pay even 25% percent of the cost and it was hard to fullfil the development bar again. So, I increased protection and only when it was necessary (when there was a large chance for the comet to hit). I played the game once and reached level 7. I would not do anything differently. I received an example of how risk management techniques are used in real life and within real communities. In order for this game to be more realistic and interesting, i recomend to developers to create some different kinds of natural disasters and different kinds of protection against them.
