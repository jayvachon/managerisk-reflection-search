The role of the risk management in the game was to avoid loss. I think I needed some time before I could understand the game and its elements i.e. knowledge,protection and insurance. My choices were trade-offs combined with guess work. If you combine the three elements and keep them under command (which is difficult) you could go to higher level. I hardly reached the third level! Was it for my mistake or maybe something was wrong with the game? I am not sure. Maybe both. The most important thing in risk management is the preparation we get to face it, and our preparation sometimes can have very good affects, that can be immediate or even after some time.If I played the game only once, I would have finished maximum the first level. I played the game more than once and could surpass level two, which I consider a success for me. There was something wrong with the game, most probably yes.I can not say what I did differently the second time, but I think I followed the same intuitions as the first time. What was the main thing I learned from the game?I think I learned a lot: how difficult it is to be in control of all elements necessary for managing risk. The more you know, the better it is. Maybe what was missing in the game was the collaboration between actors, just as it happens in real life. Coordination of actions becomes very important in catastrophic situations.As explained above, I had problems with the game. Sometimes you could not understand where  you made a mistake. What we really do (in this game and similar games) is reaction, reaction to an action,which in our case was natural phenomenon. So you can win if you react in time and intensity, and each game should give you these two possibilities.
