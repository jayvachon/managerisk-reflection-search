The role of risk management I think was to provide stability
to the community and enable it to survive floods and meteor strikes. The
insurance aspect was important as it transferred some of the burden of risk and
helped the community to repair its damages after every disaster.  Knowledge/research
was an important as it provided benefits to the community and helped mitigate
the impact of disaster. In the game we received money when we did research
which provided information about the severity and probability of the strike. In
real life research helps to prepare for a disaster and helps reduce the risks
and damages. Unfortunately in Pakistan in real situations we have a disaster
every two to three years but the government does not plan to reduce the risks. Preparation for the risk reduced the losses and helped the
community save money which was invested in raising the level of the island or
reinforcing structures.The main thing we learnt was that we have to be quick in our
investments, risk insurance and building structures. Insurance is important and
so is research. Money is the main constraint in management.







Would add a third disaster like earthquake/people causalities/injuries
+ hospitals to make the player more active and realise that there are many dimensions
to any disaster.  In Pakistan during the quake
we had thousands of deaths and causalities and hence the need for introducing
medical help, hospitals and first aid centres in the game is essential to
activate the people. I would provide the player a longer response time to
complete the necessary task of building structures and doing research. The game
was too fast to complete and natural disasters related to climate change and
economic crises do not occur suddenly but gradually providing time to the
people to plan and prepare for mitigating disasters. The player should have
plenty of time and money to play.
