The game compiled a complete trade-off between the growth and the risk insurance of the society. The knowledge of the comet impact through research, the protection level by increasing the height as well as the insurance claim that had to be done to better manage the coping effects had to be done. The better level of research was an asset as it provided higher resources to cope up with the disaster/ natural calamity.Higher insurance guaranteed a better circumstances for coping but had to be kept in check as the resource was limited and the scarcity put a constraint that could be invested in insurance. A balance between growth and coping along with insurance had to be ensured for the growth of the community. The relevancy of other communities also contributed once the comet had struck the planet, which reflected the immediate effect that was translated into the vicinity of the environment.I played the game multiple times so as to get the core idea behind the development of the game by the World Bank as compared to a more traditional format of quiz or an assignment. The first time I focused on growth of some pods only and not creating too many of them, insured them as well which finally resulted in less resources in coping. The next time I played I focused on an equal amount of growth for all and that resulted in more resources left to cope up and a better damage control level. The main thing I concluded from the above effort was focusing on the equality aspect of growth for all, as the immediate environment is the first place to go in trouble and so it should be capable enough so as to facilitate proper assistance  and growth. The another aspect was the knowledge and insuring mechanism that ensured the pods against repairs after the comet stroked the planet.We cant afford to be over-confident with our level of preparedness and underestimate the exposure to risk as no matter at which level of hierarchy of pyramid we stand at , if a calamity strikes, all of us are brought to the same deep hole and effective risk management and awareness helps us to focus on resilience and prosperity of the after effects.If got a chance to redesign the game I would definitely like to see some secondary sources that allowed more  generation of resources such as trading or deleting pod so as to generate some funds in case of a natural calamity. This allows people at the time of a natural calamity to focus on an alternative methodology of generating resources to cope up with the aftermath as well as making their time more productive just before the time of the adversity. .
