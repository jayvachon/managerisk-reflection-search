Upon seeing the game for the first time, I felt disappointed
to find a cartoonish and childish game. The game reminded me of the online
games I used to play when I was around 10’s. Game is designed very amateurly
for sure but later I realized that this game was not necessarily created to
entertain me.Despite its very low graphical quality, game really delivers
its real purpose. It perfectly illustrates the importance and also the
challenges of risk management. One can’t afford to pay too much for insurance
and also can’t afford to let things go without any insurance. This dilemma is
well established in the game. Like in the real world, chance is also a part of
the game which makes the game more realistic. Furthermore researches about
risks really help during the times of contingency as in the real world.The
risks however are caricatured as they are portrayed as asteroid falling on
planet. That might maybe justify itself considering that this game is created
also for children and requires to be not too much complex.



Overall I think the game serves well to its purpose of
creation. It could be done with better graphics but in the end it is quite
good.
