The game shows that risk management is dynamic. It is necessary an optimum resource application. Even with a good strategy, time is a very important issue. You can´t focus on a rapid development without taking care mainly of your protection. There was a
clear trade-off situation between development and protection (competing for
time) and also between development (either in upgrading or building new plots) and
insurance. During the investment in protection development freezes, so it is
necessary to invest in the right time. I´ve chosen for maintaining a high level
of protection (around 6 bars after level 2), keeping only a 33% level of
insurance and trying to upgrade the plots and observing the comets all the
time. After I´ve reached the wealth needed for the next level I started
investing in protection. The first time I´ve invested in lots of plots right
from the beginning, 50% of insurance and not much in protection (around 4
bars). After 2 or 3 times, I´ve started investing more in protection, upgrading
the plots and ‘researching’ more to get more time for the connections. I´ve
learned that repair is expensive (both in time and money), research is ‘cheap’
and development must be smooth.

I´d add a social aspect, giving one more
investment option (e.g. infrastructure and health) to force the player thinking
both in internal and external issues. I´d also change the research aspect, it
should be cumulative to reinforce that education is a long-term investment.
