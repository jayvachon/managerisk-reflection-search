The game give a great insight of risk management by requiring the players to make choices and trade-offs between, knowledge, protection, insurance and development. I decided to develop one step at a time the village without upgrading the pods too quickly. Once I had 4 pods built and still some money I focused on protecting the village accordingly to the level of danger I acquired by looking at the meteorites. Preparing the village for an eventual impacts required money and prevented me to upgrade faster the pods. However I was certain in that case that the village won't get destructed. After that, at every new level, I simply added 1 or 2 new pods and upgraded all one them at least once. And I always checked that the protection was enough to face an impact of a meteorites and avoid damage. The first time I played, I didn't get an insurance and that made me lose the first game. So the second game I started to buy insurance after the level 3 in order to be sure not to repay all the pods in case of a disaster. That was a much better strategy. By playing the game, I learned that in order to develop the village up to level 6 and in life in general, one has to make choices and trade-offs between, knowledge, protection, insurance and development. No need to try to develop too fast if you the risk management is inexistant. One need to have a long term vision and make plan accordingly to reach the goals. A long term strategy has to be developed.If I have to change something in the game, I will try to adapt it to an issue that a lot of people are facing in developing countries and that most of them are not aware and as a consequence not prepared : saving for retirement. Probably because it will only happen in decades for most of the people, too few are thinking about the risk management for that. But I think it could be really interesting to teach in a interactive way to people why it's better to prepare for the future especially when its come to their finance.
