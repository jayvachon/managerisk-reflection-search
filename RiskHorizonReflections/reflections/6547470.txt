First of all, I think the idea of the game is really good and intuitive for the topic. After reaching Level 5 (AMLjRe3), my review is the following:1) The main role of risk management was to be efficient, implementing strong action and be forward looking. The choices made were always a mix of preparation/prevention, protection, insurance and dealing with the situation once happened. As we know risk is not nor it should be avoided all the time. The mix described above, was always driven by the resources constraint which is inherently present, but it is not an excuse for not trying to achieve as much as possible by being efficient with the resources available at any point in time.Preparation did impact considerably development mostly in the form of how well and strong the recovery takes place. The base from which one starts to grow, be it constantly or after a drop, is essential in closing the negative gap. After some time this is as much as valid because when one gets stronger after a shock, the positive externalities of a strong recovery are abundant; instead of being hit and be complacent about the situation, once the recovery is internalized even though it was a big shock, that makes for a big difference.2) I played the game 7 times until I reached Level 5 and in comparison with the first tries, the main different approach was:- do not focus only on one factor- be aware of the resource constrain and correlate this with timing (if the shock is approaching fast, but no resources are available for insurance, even tough your approach was right, it was not possible to implement it)- be as much as efficient as possible: always work on one of factors and trade it off in the most efficient way given the future possible shocksMain points learned: have a plan, make the decisions, be efficient by implementing the most appropriate trade-offs, never be unprepared/be complacent (just because 2 shocks were avoided, it does not mean the 3rd one will be the same).3)  I would propose having 2 plants/islands which are impacted differently by the shocks, thus one would need to consider the same shocks but different outcomes, hence different actions and solutions to be set.Thank you,Bogdan
