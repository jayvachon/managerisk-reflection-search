I need to admit that, I have difficulty understanding the risk horizon. Summoning courage to play again and again is frustrating and because I wanted to advance in this course, I have to attempt several times to reach level 2. There are many kinds of shocks ranging: flood, famine, drought, economic collapse or even relatively small household shocks like losing a job. From Risk horizon, I have discovered that to withstand shocks from this disasters insurance is very important. I have discovered from the risk horizon that insurance plans can cover part of the repair cost and damages caused by comet and replace replace one's lost development.Development is affected, if one leaves a particular part of the land uninsured and the whole investment could be lost.If I play the game several times, I will invest my energy in protection to be able to withstand shocks.I would propose adequate education about different shocks to mitigate risk and to create opportunity through insurance.
