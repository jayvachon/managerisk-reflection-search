The role of risk management in the game was to find right balance between knowledge, protection and insurance and investments on  the  other hand and in that way provide a maximum development for planet. Because of limited resources (money), we often had to make trade offs in spending our recources between knowledge, protection and insurance. Sometimes having of right and trusty informations and knowledge can reduce our spending in protection, I made very often trade of between protection and insurance to make optimal effects. Preparation for risk affect development  immediately through spending resources and slowing down of development but in the long term we have benefits of that through decreasing of damages, savings our resources for repairing and we provide continously development. After the first time of my playing I decreased my investments in insurance and protection, trying to harmonize that with the right and trusty knowledge, also I payed attention more on development and finding better balance between development and investment in risk management. From this game I learned how much is important risk management for optimal development. I think that maybe involving some new subjects in sharing protection responsability like goverment, NGO, or private subjects will make this game more interesting. Anyway the game is excellent for learning and understanding the risk management and its most important elements.
