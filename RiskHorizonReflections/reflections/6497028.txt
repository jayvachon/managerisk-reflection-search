                                                                   The Risk Horizon Game, Saving Alora while  Eyes on the Horizon                                                               *************************************************************************************************** The role of management in the game was to protect the pods from meteor/Comets shower destruction, the trade offs to manage the risk  were buying Insurance, upgrading the construction models and researching about the intensity of meteors/Comets. Preparation for risk was to tackle the issues which were likely threat to the Alora pod development.  I played it many times and changed  many things such as different Insurance Packages, Frequent Upgrading of the pods, Starting Pod construction three at a time so that it is easy to protect and upgrade. I tried my best to balance as a Luminator all tools of Risk Management  such as Research, Protection and Insurance but somehow I could only manage to reach Level-5. What I learned is to use all Risk Protective instruments wisely is the key to protect the Alora Development. And Consistently using all protective tools can save Alora.The Game shows the risks which are related to Nature but the place I live i.e Pakistan, most of the risks are man made. Having said that I would say all the modes of protection are useful for managing the risks in Pakistan; the research, the protection and insurance. But the problem is the Cost, at what cost that tool of risk management be bought and implemented. Furthermore problem is not managing the risks in Pakistan but Mismanagement of the risks and the aftermath.       Following are the Salient Reflections that can be learned from the Game generally :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Balancing the Risk and management of sustainable Healthy DevelopmentResearching the magnitude of RiskSelection of the suitable Modes of ProtectionUsing Insurance as an effective  Tool to manage risk
