In this game, risk management means to prevent the pods being crushed by the stars. Usually it requires to increase the protection level to compete with the severity level of the stars. On the other hand, we need to keep an eye on the development of pods in order to get more money to increase the development level and complete the level goal. I usually make sure the protection level is beyond the severity of the stars, so that nothing will be damaged. It turns out that if the pods get damaged, it will cost a lot of money to repair, and the development level will drop dramatically, sometimes leads to a failure in the level. So I believe it is always a good choice to fulfill the protection level first. I usually don't buy the insurance, as my protection level is high enough to prevent any damage. However, I do experience some time that the severity is so high (such as full severity but I usually just keep the protection level for about 70%-80%) that I get a little bit damage, which always result in failing that level. I usually do not spend much money on research in the severity level of the stars, but just check it very quickly and make sure that my protection level is 20% higher than that.
I have played several times on this game. At first I didn't get the rules quite well, and I always buy the highest level of insurance and see the pods crush and repair them. I did not raise the protection level at first. I can sometimes get to level 3, but I often end the game very quickly. Then I studied the rule a bit more, and decide to put more effort on the protection level and development of pods. Then I get to pass the level requirement very quickly, and get quite good at it. I shared my experience with my peers, and they all get good results using my strategy. xD
