I played the game several times, with the goal to reach at least level 4. In the first few rounds, I mostly focused on the incoming meteors, researching them so that they would either miss or have a less severe impact. The longer I played, the more I started combining strategies: I would still focus on the meteors, but while doing that, I would upgrade my settlements, raising the platform (not too much, not too little) - and, most importantly, at the beginning of each level, I would by the insurance that would pay 75% if my settlements got damaged. (Of course, once I did get hit, I would forge as many community connections as quickly as I could, to minimize damage further).What I learned from the game (as reflected in the strategy that I eventually used), is that you do need to keep an eye out for the risks that are/might be coming your way, learn about them as much as necessary (which does not mean everything; for example, when I saw that a meteor had low severity and low chance to hit, I would tend to ignore it in favor of other, more threatening incoming meteors), assess how to best deal with them, and go ahead and do it. Baseline protection and/or insurance is also key; how much or how little depends on the likelihood of the event in question actually occurring/the risk actually meaning loss. Community connections, when forged in a timely manner and with strong enough bonds, can also help to bear some of the brunt when disaster strikes. If one is covered in this way, with baseline protection/insurance, community ties and knowledge of the possible risks and their probability of occurring (and resources allocated accordingly), it means that the remaining energy and resources) can be used to seize opportunities presenting themselves (such as upgrading the settlements in the game), which may in turn lead to increased income, escape from poverty, higher standard of life, and being less afflicted if the projected disaster or event eventually does strike.Overall, I did find the game very educational, and it got me thinking about prioritizing and balancing in risk management versus taking opportunities.One thing I might change about the game, though, would be introducing the possibility of certain members of the community refusing to cooperate with others - how would that weaken or change the risk management?
