   Play this game for over 10 times. At beginning spent a lot of money (cost) build many protector, but it is not so useful for this game design, because immediately I found it will use up the money. So I change the policy to use insurance when the hit probability is high and destroy is serious, then choose high insurance rate(gain). If both of them are low, then need not to make any insurance.
   Gradually, I found keep on research on the target (cost low), it will decrease its hitting probability and become less destroy (gain high), so I keep the policy to monitor the target on research mode, then pass the game level 2.

1. Role of risk management is to let the destroy become minimum.
   Trade-off strategies: High risk choose 75% high insurance rate. Low probability just not use insurance.
    Preparation: Keep use "research"(monitor bump) to lower the risk (hit probability and serious level), it will be change gradually.
2. Play more time will improve my skill. I learned how to balance the cost-gain.
3. My living place: Gradually improve the air pollution by replace the gasoline by electrical power, or instead of driving car by taking 
    mass transportation.
