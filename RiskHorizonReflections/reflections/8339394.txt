The role of risk management
     in this game is mainly the development of the  community with proper
     research, protection and insurance. It is mainly about balancing the development and managing risk with proper knowledge about the problem i.e. what is the problem involved, how badly it will effect, what will be loss etc and then accordingly acting upon it, whether to take up insurance or not or whether to use protection. It is mainly how well you use your limited resources to get out of this problem Research with respect to game and
     course is to  get knowledge about the risk or problem involved that is what would be the
     possibility of getting hit, what would be loss, what can be done to
     minimize the risk or to escape from risk.Protection is taking proper steps
     to minimize the risk or avoid the risk, in this game that was achieved by raising the
     protection bar. Insurance is mainly to mitigate the loss and to indemnify
     the loss occurred.  One must have to balance between development of community
     and preparing for potential shocks by proper research,  power of
     protection to protect from damage  and insurance to trade off the
     loss if in case hit by a comet. The choices i made was doing research to
     check what was possibility of getting hit by comet and what would be
     damage caused ones hit by the comet  and accordingly raising the
     protection. If necessary purchasing insurance to trade off the loss
     occurred due to hit of comet. With help of proper preparation i could
     cross 3rd level. It immediately had a impact on development. With proper
     research i could predict whether i had danger from comet. I had to
     properly balance my investment, if i would invest too much on the
     development and not on the protection and insurance that would be risky as
     any time i would be hit by comet and my development bar would fall and if
     i would invest carefully in research, protection and insurance and then go
     for development that would increase my development bar.
 I played game more then one
     time and i learnt a lot after every attempt. Initially i kept developing
     and upgrading and every time purchased insurance without doing much
     research and on protection i wouldn't do much investment, with this kind
     of strategy i could not cross even level one then i went through tutorial
     got idea how to go about it. Then i carefully played, first i developed by
     setting some ponds, every time i see comet i would do research and would
     get to know what is probability of getting hit and if hit what would be
     the damage. Accordingly I would  invest in protection to safeguard
     from damage, i would always keep my protection level of 5 or 6 bars . I
     always kept my protection level higher then severity level. If severity
     level was more than my protection level had no money to invest for
     protection then i would purchase insurance to trade off loss. With help of
     insurance i could recover  loss at cheaper rates. The main intention of keeping this game is to how to deal with the risk. Every time i play this game same thing happens and i am always out  before completing 3rd level.This is mainly because i have not been given performance appraisal. Only ones mistakes are pointed out one can overcome those mistakes. so proper review has to be given to that we learn from it and one more thing is the development bar rises with a very low phase, so that had to be fair and should match our strategies.
