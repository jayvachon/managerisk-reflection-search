The role of risk management is to prevent loss which do happen due to comets hits the sea which resulted to wave destruction of the development projects maintained for a long time.I had to choose between research, insurance and protection due to budget constraints. I used to insure by development which compensated. I used research to protect my self from the current losses just as i used protection.Preparation affects development in that: The fund which could have be used for development i have used for: insurance, protection and knowledge. It also affect development in long tern in case the risks protected for does not happen.I have played the game more that once. in order to meet my development goal i had to simultaneously ensure my level of protection,knowledge and insurance is maintained along with efforts for development. I do have to many times to consider severity and hit meters so as to know whether i was in the risk to loose. I also have to upgrade or develop my region to ensure maximum development.From the game I learned that: Development is subjected to risks which if not considered and planned for it my result in a loose which can hinder development in long run. Hence proper plans to prepare against and complies with the expected/resulted risk should be be implemented.From the game, I would propose to replace comets with bad weather condition. This is because I live in the place with people whose main development activities is agriculture. These peasants depend in rainfall to rise and harvest the product. As a result they are faced with the risk of bad weather condition such as shortage of rainfall/droughts. Thus proper effort should be devoted to insure,protect and do research( waether forecast) to be able to predict and or have a means of being compensated ( for instance insurance) in case it happen out of prediction.
