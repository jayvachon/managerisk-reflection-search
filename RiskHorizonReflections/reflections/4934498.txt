Repair Costs and Risks are two sides of coin. One need to make decision of only one at a time. Repair costs can help the infrastructure/product to withstand risk either by no damage or by some less amount of repair cost.
So its better that before the risk occurs, one should pay attention and develop the product/infrastructure to withstand risks.
