The game
exemplifies the need of preventing, protecting, mitigating and, when hit,
coping with damage.

Although resources
were useful, perhaps the scarcest was time. 
It certainly was a fact I did not consider when I read the games instructions.  Although I was aware of the need of
increasing protection, it sometimes took too much time, diverting me from other
important preventive actions as gaining knowledge through research.

I found
that my results were more successful when I decided to protect further than
what the immediate comets were requiring. 
Although this was time and resources consuming, the more I leveled up
the island the more likely the city was of mitigating most of the hits,
resulting many times in no damage at all.

I did not
get what the research was all about until I played several times.  Finally, I realized that it was perhaps the
most cost-effective measure to be taken. 
It was way cheaper than any building improvement but allowed more
protection.

There are
many lessons to learn from the game and I want to highlight the following:

Decision-makers face constant
trade-offs.  Economists know that every
resource is scarce and it is a science to understand how to use them in the
most efficient way to solve the greatest amount of necessities with the fewer
resources.  When policy dictates that risk
management should allocate more resources for infrastructure (i.e., leveling up
the land) it is predictable that there would be less money for research. Another lesson is that as it may
sound obvious, preparation requires time. 
In many cases, comets hit the town and made damage because the
possibility of a severe hit was not foreseen on time.  When the comet was finally visible, it was
sometimes too late to protect the territory as needed. There is also a reflection I would
like to make on insurances.  At first was
very prudent and bought the 75% insurance at every single level.  Suddenly I realized that if I had a good protection
and research strategy, damages will be very few and insurance was practically unnecessary.  In real life, we always run the risk of
having people consider that they “wasted” their money when they bought an
insurance that was not used.  As weird as
it sounds, this may disappoint people and refrain them from buying new
insurances for later periods.









If I were
to improve the game, I would work on making understandable that the connections
do make a real difference when a catastrophe arrives.  It was not very clear how the “click-and-drag”
should work but I think it has a huge potential to improve the game experience.
