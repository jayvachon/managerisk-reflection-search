Reflections from the Risk Horizon Game1.      
The Risk Horizon Game includes in an attractive computer game development and risk management   It is necessary to achieve  an adequate management of the risks
to win the game.  So in the game developing
without consideration of the question of risk management is clearly doomed. But the right
combination of risk management and development is difficult to achieve.  The preparation for risks is valuable from
the beginning of the game, but too much preparation can imperil development, as it consumes
resources and time. So it is necessary to accept some risks.

In the first level, it pays off to develop the
infrastructure and protection, in subsequent levels, when the game is more
frantically, it advisable to develop knowledge and get insurance, since protection
takes relatively more time.

2.      
After the first time I discovered the importance
of knowledge.  So after developing the
first pods, i suggest to follow the meteorites and develop knowledge
since it can prevent the damages or diminishes its impacts, counterbalancing the risk in a very cost effective manner.

 The main thing I learned from the game is
the importance to balance development with risk management. It pays off to manage
risks; investment in risk management is very cost effective, as in the real world.

3.      
I suggest that the game includes credit, more money
will help the economy and the attractive of the game, since it will introduce another
risk to deal with;  financial sustainability risk, which will be produced when
the player can’t repay the debt or its interests, which could fluctuate and get higher as the player faces more difficulties. In this case it will be
advisable to introduce into the game foreclosures and the possibility to sell the plants.
