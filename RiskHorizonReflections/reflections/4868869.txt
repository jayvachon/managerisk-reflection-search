1.       Risk management is the topic of the game,
it is central to the game which challenges the player to find the right balance
between protection, insurance, research, construction and the timing. The game also
shows how community network is central to recovery after a disaster. 

I did several games, and I started without a high level of protection
and insurance. I was able to build quickly, and level after level, I have grown
my insurance and protection. I felt I have reached a higher level when using an
intermediate level of insurance: it allowed me to have enough money to build.
On the next parties I did, I chose to have a maximal insurance and protection,
and was not able to build as much – and eventually failed the level. I found
that a 

too high level of risk preparation entails that development will be
slower (but safer). The game shows well how risk preparation is essential.

2.       Now that I have done a few games (I
have tried 4 times), I would play again using a 50% insurance instead of 75%
and see if you can get to a higher level. I would also more take research into
consideration.

The main things I have learned from the game is how development and risk
management are intertwined and need to be run in parallel. I found it interesting
to use the community to lower the consequences to the disaster.

3.       If I was to change a little thing in
the game, I would diversity the threats coming (maybe I haven’t gone far enough
to see other threats than the falling stars). For instance, have earthquakes,
floods, building falling apart after some time (they need renovation), a
financial crisis. For instance, for a financial crisis, the money given would
be lower during a “financial crisis” level, so the money should be use even
more carefully. There would be several insurances to choose from, and several
level of protection, so the game would be a little more complex.
