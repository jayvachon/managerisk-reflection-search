Risk Horizon Game Reflections 1. The role of risk management was a primary one in the game, whose objective was to maximize gain while minimizing catastrophic losses (which wipe out gains and prevent you from winning the game). Risk management was used to determine how to minimize the losses while at the same time not impeding the accumulation of gains.  The objective of the game is really quite similar to real life - though in real life the risks are not always apparent and so it is possible to ignore them, at least until a catastrophe strikes.The three tools for managing risk in the game (knowledge, protection and insurance) needed to be balanced against the two built-in constraints of limited time and money.  For instance knowledge and protection were both time dependent and so the time allotted to each had to be balanced against the other. So if the initial assessment of the asteroid risk showed it to be low, not as much time needed to be spent on protection and therefore more time could be spent on refining knowledge. But if the risk was high, most of the time needed to be spent increasing the protection rather than knowledge.  Of course, insurance utilised the money resource, of which there was a limited quantity.So, if the decision was made to spend all the money on development immediately, the purchase of insurance had to be delayed until the reserves could be built back up.  Conversely if insurance was purchased immediately, then development was delayed and the growth of money was also delayed.2. It seems to me that the key to the game is balancing risk with development. When I used most of my resources to minimize risk, development was delayed and I did not reach the goal to advance to more stages. What I had to do differently to advance was to not use all my resources to minimize risk, but to use some for development as well. In that way, I ended up with more resources to gradually increase risk protection. In short, what I learned from the game is that risk protection is very important, but it must be balanced with development to achieve real success. Further I learned that knowledge is important to success. The situation must be constantly monitored.3. The game encapsulated the problem of real life risk management quite well for such a simple game. However, it seems to me that the game deviates from real life in the sense that impending catastrophes very often cannot be seen or predicted in advance as the asteroid strikes could. Catastrophes come out of the blue, or at least they seem to. A version of the game that simulates the type of unpredictability seen in real life would make the game more true to life in my opinion.
