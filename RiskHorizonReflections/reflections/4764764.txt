The
role of risk management in the game:

On
the one hand, we want to build as much as we can the community, but there is a
danger

Of comets
destroying the assets built.

Therefore
we should invest part of the resources in  knowledge,
protection, and insurance.

The
knowledge help us to learn about the severity of the threat and the probability
to get heart.

When
the threat is severe with reasonable probability or thereat is medium with high


Probability
we should get prepared by buying protection and/or insurance.

The
protection helps when the shock happens, the insurance helps to mitigate the
damages

After
the shock  already happened.

We
have to find the balance between building more houses and preparing for disaster
on

The
other hand, putting too much resources on preparing for risk will not allow to
enlarge the community, so the strategy is to build as much as possible and when
comes a threat as described above – buy protection and insurance, divide the
money  on both, but not more

Than
30% of the assets.

The
research is mandatory in order the asses the severity of the threat.

 

If I
played the game only once I'd purchase more protection and insurance relatively
to

many
repetitions of the game, since in a one game play a shock might destroy all the
assets

even
when the probability is not high, so the mean(expectancy) is the same, but
standard

deviation
is much larger for a 1 game play. That's why a risk averse person would buy a
lot

of
insurance and protection, to lower the risk, but also the gain.

On
the other hand – with many repetitions the statistics will bring us close to
the mean,

And
 in one of the games to a large gain more
than the average.

The
learning from the game: invest in knowledge, buy reasonable protection/insurance


For
protection and recovery.

 

If
I could change one thing in the game:

I'd
add a more direct measure to asses the quantity of the threat , the value of
protection

And
its benefit and the exact cover y of the insurance, this would help the player
to

Get
a reasonable decision, based on data.
