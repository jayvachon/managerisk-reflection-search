First of all, I want to thank you, for spending time on grading my opinion. Sorry if the text have semantic or any orthografic issues, I am not a native english speaker.This game, as most have noticed (if played at least twice) its not a predictable game. In fact de trade-off** between making barriers, taking an insurance or investigating the asteroids agree with conventional economics theory; for economics exist a limitation of resources and you "must" fit the best for them, the game faced us how a combination of Xn factors in function of resources can give us many different results, as being destroyed by the shocks or being inable to coping with the consecuences.This kind of simple desitions exist every day, the case I know in my country must be similar: In many poor regions, people take place to live in high risk of natural disaster zones because they have no enought resourses to pay for a place out of risk, its a risk management desition; having or not having the risk its totaly in function of income/resources they have.In my opinion, game was a good experience simple but it gives you the necesary ammount of ideas to make desitions. I played twice, first I reached level 5 because I made strong barriers, was good enought almost finishing the game. I tried a second time but focused on developing fast and having high insurance; it didn't work as first time.If I had the opportunity to change something in the game I would rather prefer to have more kind of negative natural disasters and some positive shocks, were no positive shocks and they sometimes happens in real world (merely never, but are fortitous events).**If you´re not familiar with economic theory, you could check on the next link I suggest (its easy way explained) to better understanding what this game impplies.http://www.shmoop.com/economic-principles/opportunity-costs.html
