My reflections
from the Risk Horizon game.

Risk
assessment by definition involves considering the hazards, exposure issues and
vulnerabilities. 

It has been
recognized that the risk arising from the combination of a threat (hazard) and
issues more or less vulnerable, taking into account vulnerability as a
fundamental component of risk as well as the random delays to get into the
habit. 

It is
mainly treated in the form of feedback on the responses, adaptations, behavior
at the negative events and their socio-economic and regional consequences. Research
concerning also part of a process of risk assessment when the authors attempt
to diagnose human vulnerability by studying the quality of threat perception or
memory, knowledge of the means of protection, the types of behaviors potential,
etc..

Through the
year to which I faced in this game, I realized able to analyze the different
aspects of risk management in the context of development. I also realized, to
what extent a risk when not properly managed can change the initial state of an
item and sometimes cause its disappearance. 

This game
has is to prevent threats to prevent them from reaching the area to be
protected. For this reason, it was necessary that I use several strategies
namely: protection and insurance. 

First, the
protection has allowed me to avoid threats or mitigate their impacts and
finally the insurance allowed me to repair the damage in case of infringement. 

For this
game, I struggled in the mastery of the rules but then I realized he was tagged
vulnerable areas and purchased insurance to repair the damage. 

To improve
this game, it would create mechanisms to reroute the threats to destroy or
reduce their impacts.

This game
was a great experience for me and actually puts in evidence the realities of
this course.

It was a
simulation success and I think I learned a lot.
