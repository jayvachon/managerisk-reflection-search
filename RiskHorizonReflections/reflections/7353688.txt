1. In this game, risks management plays an important role：I have to 
learn the rules principle, to notice the probability of the hits happen, to read 
the tips after a failure game, then I adjust my action, and I may do better 
again and again. in the level one，protection is not as important as in the level two, so as in the level two, protection is not as vital as in the level three; mending quickly before the next damage is the best way to protection for a long way. However, for an immediate way, I can change the level of the sea to protect the pods escaping from the damage. 
 
2.The most important things I learned from the game is not to protect my pods 
as well as I can, but the truth I have learned is that I should develop my pods 
as well as I can, as quickly as I can, however, the risks which would happen suddenly can also be 
researched. in the first time, I only develop my pods well and i always want to upgrade the only two or three pods, it is pretty dangerous, because I do not prefer the insurance, and finally I lose the game without enough money to repair the pods. So, learned that I have to develop the pods as quick as I can, and keep the bar green, then getting to level two, before the star hit the earth, buying more insurance, I would easily to repair my pods.
 
3.This vision reflect well of risks management, and for a new vision of the game, I would change the slowly moving hits to a small quantity 
of suddenly dropping hits.The aim is to plus more systemic risks, and players would notice more importance of quickly development and more necessary of buying insurance.
