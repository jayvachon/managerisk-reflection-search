Not withstanding the technical difficulties posted by the game, I can say that the key role of risk managemnt was how to balance in strengthening the community to that of preventing being destroyed using the given resources, protection and insurance. At certain points, I had to choose if I first build my pods or deal with the comets. At times, I had to deal with spending the resources available for constructing the pods or using the resource for protection. I would say that I did not really see the very impact of preparation to risks in relation to development in the game. But definitely, it is preparedness that helps in already winning half of the battle.The first time I tried the game, it was exploratory and then I went more into tactical approach after learning of the resources that I can use. I just started to construct the pods and only then prepared for the comet. I will change the pacing specially when there are 2 comets coming so that response can be faster. It is really the knowledge of where things are, how to use them at a given time and tactically releasing them at a given moment that I learned from ther game. But of course, it is also the winning over after having tried all sorts of approaches; gaining ground since we want to address the risks that are present and could still be coming. It was harder when there were more comets coming at almost the same time and the response (due to lack of resources) is slow. This seem to be the case whenever there were more comts coming.I would propose to have a given and existing security within the community since we are not starting from scratch; e.g. facilities and infrastrcutre that can be improved or further integrated into other resources to a given vulnerable area or existing knowledge that can be further enhanced thus being more concrete and creative.
