This game was very
knowledgeable as it throws light on the importance of managing risks in the
most efficient way. It was exigent in all its aspects. The game encompasses the
concept of risk management in all the levels, thereby giving me an ultimate
exposure of different stages of risks and their after-effects. A strategy game
that inculcates within itself the challenges that could be symbolically related
to the instances in our daily life. Being the Luminator of Alora, the task
given was to develop the community by foreseeing risks and to make sure that
there is advancement in the society. It was a very thought-provoking game as it
enables us to take decisions and take the right amount of risks by researching
on them. By building pods, the rate of development would increase and thereby
making the environment much safer.

It was important to
note that there should be a sense of balance throughout as we had to check for few
parameters before we could develop and safeguard the land. This aspect taught
me the significance of responsibility that we possess in our lives to take care
of the environment we live in and also to take considerable amount of risks on
an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the community to bear the shocks
but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It is indeed really
important to research on the risks that come our way and eventually develop on
a protection plan to minimize the damages from it. Insurance is also a key
element in the game, as it ensures and safeguards the land from major damage.
It will be cheaper and quicker to rebuild the pods after damage. Striking a
balance between them all and performing each action with utmost care was indeed
a very challenging task. 

While playing the game,
it was also important to do proper time management as we had a time constraint
in developing the land of Alora and also to protect them from the waves caused
by the meteors. So within the stipulated time, good research, protection,
development and insurance against the damages were to be done in the best
possible way. Good research was mandatory as it educated us with the
performance and the severity of the meteors and how it could affect the
environment. Preparation of risks also helped in money management. Building the
right number of pods with the given budget and also to insure them was a
decision that we had to take after much observation and thought. 

While playing the game for
the first time, I had restricted myself to only 25% insurance, but as I moved
on, it was important to take bigger risks and hence had to increase the insurance
to 75%. Though building pods was important to develop the land, insuring them
against meteor waves was equally important. Thereby, it was important for me to
strike a sense of balance between time, money and the resources at all points
during the game. 

If I were to develop a
new version of the game, I would have made it comparatively more realistic by introducing
real life situations of protecting a city or environment and have obstacles and
risks in relation to the real-life scenarios. I would have also introduced few
other concepts in which the players could make some money as they deal with
damages and also new ways to manage the risks.
