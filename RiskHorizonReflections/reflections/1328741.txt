management has definitely played a huge role in the game. For starters, it has
put me in a situation where I have had to balance many different issues,
however small in amount, to achieve the growth required in the limited time
given. It has opened my eyes to how important these decisions can be,
especially in terms of what is given up in return for development. 

                For
example, at the beginning of the game, I gave each element equal importance,
and failed miserably by the end of level 2 or 3. However, when I gave very
little importance to research, and cut down my insurance by one level, I was
able to maintain the growth the game required of me in the limited time.

                The
main things I learned from this game was how important certain aspects of the
resources given allows you to judge what is more important. I did give
protection quite a bit of my attention, but by level I increased it and relied
on community connections to make up for the shortcomings.

                If I
were to add a simple element to this game to make it more realistic to where I
live, I would add the human element. I think we rarely look at how human behaviour
affects the outcomes of risk management. With insurance, adequate protection
and even research, human behaviour matters greatly. If the population is
unhappy, the effort they would give to rebuild and develop would be mediocre,
to say the least. I believe adding that extra ‘population response/happiness’
would add more challenge to the game instead of just increasing the number and
pace of meteor hits.
