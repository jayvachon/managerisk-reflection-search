1) The game was quite interesting and it involved developing the pods or given task against the shocks. In this case the comets from the sky.Aim is to carry out the development in time bound manner while protecting it from the shocks or disasters. As a fact, there was involved a trade-off in this game. While insurance was there as well as protection but buying those services involved a cost and obviously as in any case, limited money means you will have to think what to buy, how much to buy and how much to spend on research which will be beneficial in longer term.2) Being frank, I had very much technical problems while playing this game as it was not loaded and when it loaded it was really nightmare.Still I have invested too much time time on that but could not cross the 2nd level due to the technical glitches.The first time when I played it, I didn't focused much on research but on insurance.However, protection slider gave me too much problem and could not achieve the desired results.3) The real motive behind the game is to teach resource management while considering the risk aspect.However, four resources namely insurance, protection, research and time had a major mismatch vis-a-vis to development.I would like to improve that in the game.
