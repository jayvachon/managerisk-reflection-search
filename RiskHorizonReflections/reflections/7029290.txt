Risk Management's Role in this game is obtain knowledge in order to provide efficient protection by means of either or both insurance and owned resources in order to save the town of falling metorites. Knowledge was also a very important tool on the game since it provided information regarding probability of the risk happening, as well as the impact proportions of the same. Knowledge of the risk allowed me to be able to use my resources to reinforce security on the buildings by improving their construction, increase the whole town's protection level or increasing insurance coverage 

once an asteroid hit, community protection and insurance were effective means for coping with the damage. Also it was important to keep a stable monetary level in order to repair damage quickly before another asteroid might hit. Risk management allowed the town to survive longer the asteroid impact and under better circumstances. Preparation of risk is alwas a key element on risk management since it facilitates coping in case of an event and reduces potential risks. I played the game more than one time and I learned that handling all four elements simultaneously (hight level of the town, knowledge of the asteorid's impact, improving hoseholds and obtaining insurance) are essential to progressing to the next levels. Risk managment is no different. Is a mix of many key elements, all directed to better our lives.Â  If I could change something about the game it would be the actual effect of insurance. Even though I changed my insurance level several times, I did not see where it applied at the end of each level. Insurance is supposed to allow you to focus your assets on technology for example but in the game, insurance purchase did very Little difference to the final indicators.
