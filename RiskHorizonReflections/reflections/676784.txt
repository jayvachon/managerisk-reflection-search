Beyond risks and opportunities, constraints exist as well in the world of project management. Unlike risks and opportunities, constraints are known in advance. In the imaginary world we were supposed to develop, comets represented risk (of causing damage to settlement being developed) and available (limited) resources had to be distributed between proactively managing risks, increasing knowledge and investing into community development. That reflects well the real world PM scenario in which project budget is distributed among project activities, with risk management being one of them. Risks were mitigated through protection (elevation of settlement), insurance and knowledge collection. Balancing all three approaches to achieve maximum results (level of protection) was a delicate effort at the very heart of the game.

Personally, I am not a big fan of computer games, so, this was my first gaming experience after quite a few years. It took me a while (and definitely more than just one game) to reach level four. As I struggled to move beyond level 1, it became clear that I was not distributing resources optimally and different approaches had to be explored in order to improve my results, achieve objectives within deadlines and move forward. As in most games, learning experience was primarily based on one’s own mistakes. What remained unclear to me was what factors influenced growth of resources we spent on risk mitigating activities. It was clearly visible that available budget grows over time, but what caused that growth remained a mystery. That would be something to improve in next version of the game, from my perspective. In real societies, budgets do not appear accidentally and by supernatural causes, but are results of multiple external and internal factors that change over time. 

As far as other aspects of the game that should be improved in potential new versions are concerned, I would like to see more elaboration related to the knowledge gathered through comet research. How does it affect income (budget) as well as other aspects of the community protection?

Additionally, as we have four ways to manage risks n general (mitigation, avoidance, acceptance and transfer), I think that it might be interesting and useful to introduce a broader range of risks into the game in order to illustrate different approaches to risk management (for example – insurance is a scholarly example of risk transfer while sufficient elevation of settlement may serve as an example of either risk avoidance or mitigation). 

Finally, instant corrective feedback (based on personal results, achievements of the gamer) would be beneficial and useful.

To summarize, the game is an interesting approach to teaching about risk management, definitely, and should be used in this and similar courses, as well as expanded in future revisions.
