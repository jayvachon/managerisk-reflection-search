My first strategy when playing the game was to expand my city by building many different houses. As the houses were cheap, it resulted in fast development. Research allowed me to dodge the impact of most meteors, meaning that I could pass level one without too much difficulty. However, the lack of protection and insurance meant that if a serious shock hit, it would spell the end of the game for me. In other rounds of the game, I instead concentrated on building a few buildings to their max. This made it easier to rebuild after a shock, and allowed me to spend a bit more on protection. I conclude that even if the shocks can be foreseen, it is impossible to brace against them on short notice if no prior measures had been implemented.
A community should therefore invest in efficient, durable upgrades first, with emphasis on investments that provide the most value for money, based on expected return. For example, insurance in the game was often not required for the first few levels, as protection provided enough resilience to withstand the shocks. Since protection did not expire at the end of a level, it proved a better investment, as it could help withstand more shocks later.
Having a small amount of very developed infrastructure also made it much easier to repair after a shock had hit. This could also be true in real life, where more developed and resistant structure would result in less maintenance cost, operational costs, and repair costs after shock damage.
There is also something to be said about the last minute benefits that can be gained when facing risk. Research in the game allowed more time to create links, which in turn resulted in better protection. Even if this protection was ephemeral, it is sometimes the difference between success and defeat. The real life parallel is that a community should always be ready to react and enact last-minute policies and preparations when a shock is imminent.
The game presents many aspects of risk, and still more parallels could be drawn from it. Real life is of course much more complicated, due to the many different sources of shocks that can compound and come up at any time, but the same principles apply. Between knowledge, preparation, protection, and insurance, the negative effects of shocks can be greatly minimized, and opportunities can be captured with much more efficiency, resulting in a better quality of life for everyone involved.
