Game Reflection By Ajibola Akeju

 

1.  Risk management technique or processes was
very useful in playing the risk horizon game. 
It involved the interplay of knowledge, protection and insurance in
managing the risk posed by the falling meteors which strikes the planet and
damages it. 

There
was continuous trade-off between the three components – knowledge, protection
and insurance, taking into cognizance the available resources for developing
the planet (represented by the available funds) in the presence of risks and
the accompanying shocks if the risk event (falling meteors) materializes.  There was also the interplay of the economic
principle of “opportunity cost” in selecting the component of risk management
to choose at any point in time considering the available resources.

Knowledge
played an important role in knowing the severity and likelihood of damage from
the meteor, while insurance was important in fixing the damage after it occurred.  Protection was also important in making the
planet cope with the shocks.  However,
for me, the game showed the importance of insurance which we in the developing
world usually ignore.

The
game showed that preparation is the bedrock of risk management using the
components of knowledge, insurance, and protection.

 

2.  I played the game up to ten times, though I
did not go through the tutorials initially. 
This helped me in playing the game without any guide to risk management
and showed clearly the disastrous effect of not preparing for risks, because I
couldn’t go past Level 2.  After going
through the tutorial and learning about the game and how to play it (shows the
importance of knowledge and information gathering), I was able to play the game
and get to Level 4. This taught me the importance of preparation and making use
of knowledge, protection, and insurance to manage risks and cope with the
aftermath of the shocks emanating from the occurrence of the risk event.

 

3.  In developing a new version of the game for
my country, Nigeria, I would stress the importance of the all the components –
knowledge, protection, and insurance. 
However, I would highlight insurance as a component that we must start
to embrace in order to prepare for and cope with risk.  Taking up insurance is not popular here and
most people lack basic knowledge about its importance.
