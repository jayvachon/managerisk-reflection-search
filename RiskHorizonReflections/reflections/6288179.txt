The game presents several aspects, the high risk of meteors and floods, several tools to prevent the impact such as: insurance, protection by the rising terrain and
behavioral research of meteorites
with the possibility to prepare for
their impact at the same time. It
is proposed to construct buildings that
allow the economic development of the community and the creation of communication networks that allow to prepare for the impact of meteorites. 
One of the keys to improving the quality of life of the community was to start adapting the terrain elevation, so
that from the outset the
possibility of flooding is prevented,
in this case the proper planning allows better risk management, back of this, purchase insurance to preserve the
investment, the gradual construction
of the infrastructure created more
resources to invest in prevention,
on the other hand, the proper investigation of the behavior of
meteorites to lessen
its effects. 
In the short term, there were not
many resources to build, however to the extent that it was moving time, having no damage
meteorites, money could invest more and
more to build better building and the return
of the invested in measures to
manage risk in the short term yielded increasingly higher
economic growth. At this point we can say that when a community cares about their environment
can be prepared in a suitable manner
to what occurs in
time, reduce damage, and if you
need to work on reconstruction, to
be able to decrease the amount of resources invested through
the preparation.Â 
Risk management offers a cost appropriate long-term benefit to the extent that
allows the development of populations, economic growth while ensuring
that the acquired is not lost with the emergence of a risk.If a new version of the game were to arise it would take into account
the position of the people, and the creation of strong
connections, could raise the
possibility of some people
specialize in different tasks so that everyone can contribute to the development of research or construction.



Highlighted
the importance of equity in the distribution of resources, as not favoring some
sectors of the population, but
allowed the arrival of resources
at all, and this may kick in
my country, Colombia, since those who suffer the
greatest impacts of disasters are
those with fewer economic resources.



   If within the policies of a country arises from the start mitigating the risks, you can ensure a future better management of resources, not being constantly putting out fires, you can offer people the possibility of development of strengthening relationships as a community and equitable growth that will improve the economy, and a very good knowledge of the environment allows the resources to invest in activities that offer a greater profit without much risk.
