There are a number of aspects to this game. Basically, I have to build a community and lead to it to prosperity by building pods and upgrading them. I have to simultaneously protect them from risks (comets) by buying insurance and upgrading my protection plan. Money management is very important in this game. We start with $1000. First, I built a pod and bought insurance. There are different insurance plans which cover 33%, 50% and 75%, each one more expensive then the next, and more expensive as the levels increase as well. Playing it safe, I always bought the insurance with the most coverage in case of a comet strike. One of the first things I learnt was to manage my money on both construction and safety.Researching risk is crucial. It was also important to study the comets. To save my pods from destruction, I had to match my protection level with the severity of the comet. In the case that a comet strikes, I have the chance to use community connection to reduce the damages on my pods. I have learnt that this relates to interdependence between communities in real life. What captured my attention was that spending more time researching the comet meant more time to get help from community connection, as well as more accurate predictions of severity and chance of strike. Hence, studying the possible risks is vital in protecting ourselves.Time management is vital. We have to build and protect our community and proceed to the next level within a limited time frame. Hence, we cannot procrastinate and have to make swift decisions. To make full use of my time, I built and upgraded pods while researching the comets. This allowed me to build my community and take measures to protect it simultaneously. A combination of money management, time management and researching risk led to a fairly successful community, where none of my pods were damaged throughout the game.The first time I played the game, I was very focused on increasing my protection level to the maximum. I did not research the comet. This led to a very short amount of time to use community connection when a comet struck. Needless to say, I did not proceed to level 2. The second time I played, I took time management and researching risk into consideration and managed to reach level 5. If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would add a savings aspect, which would provide incentives for players who decide to save money. I think savings are crucial when it comes to risks such as recession and job security. I would like to add that it has been a pleasure playing this game and that it was a fantastic idea to incorporate it into a course.
