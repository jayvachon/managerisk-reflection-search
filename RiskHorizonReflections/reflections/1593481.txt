The game helped me develop an effective Risk Management Plan that helped in keeping small issues 
from developing into emergencies. It helpedÂ  me deal with calculating the probability of an event via research on the comets, and how 
that event might impact my score. I knew what the risks were for instance level of severity and chance of hit. This helped me mitigate the problems associated with these risks. I would buy insurance cover or raise the ground. I made the choice of continuously developing the island and this worked for a time as it helped in increasing my speed to get to the next level. The trade-offs was against increasing the level of the island. I learned earlier on to spend more time on research and this helped quite a bit. By developing the island, I was able to increase my resources and thus when I was hit I was able to repair the damage and also procure a larger insurance cover in case of sever damage to the island.I would definitely focus more on developing the site and carrying out more research on the comets. My biggest learning point was that the more time I spent on research the more I increased my chances of getting to the next level.I would work on changing the effect of increasing the impact increasing the level of the island has on ensuring that when you get hit there is not too much damage. This would offer better protection.In my country I would propose acquiring knowledge on the weather patterns especially when dealing with floods. There is one place that floods every year and causes so much material damage to the residents. There are no mitigating factors in place so a clear way of dealing with this would be of great help to the residents by ensuring that their lives are not disrupted.
