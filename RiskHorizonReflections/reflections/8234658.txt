Risk
management has played a key role in the game, since all the choices I had to
take while playing it involved trade-offs. In order to develop the planet I had
to invest resources either in building the new world or in protecting it from
the meteors. As it was explained in the instructions, the goal was to balance
both efforts. Anyone who focused only in speeding up the construction and
improvement of the houses would not take the necessary measures to avoid the
destruction of the facilities. On the other hand, someone who worried only
about the safety of the planet would not have resources to develop it, since
all the money would be spent in preventing or mitigating risks.

 

In
other words and using soccer as an example - after all, today is July 12th and this
is the last weekend of the 2014 World Cup in Brazil -, no soccer team can put all the players up in front trying to score at all costs neither keep them in
the back the whole macht, trying to avoid losing the game. In order to win,
it is necessary to do both: to score and to defend. Or, simply, to have balance.

 

When
I prioritized the safety of the planet, by strengthning the defense power to block the damage caused by the meteors, my development rate grew slower
and I did not achieve in time the milestone required to move forward for the
next level. The opposite also happened: when I put more resources in building
houses to achieve the required development pace, my defenses got weaker and I
had a set back after the planet was hit by a high severity meteor. It happened
especially in level 6, which, by the way, I was not able to finish.

 

After
playing the game a few times, I realized I was supposed to keep an eye on the
bar on the left, making sure my actions would make it turn green and not red.
The bar would turn red whenever I focused too much on prevention or mitigation.
That gave me the clear sense that risk management is about making sure that
people and their communities - cities, states, countries or the entire world -
get more and more developed - in a sustainable way, of course. The aspects regarding prevention are extremely
important, but the real goal is to allow people to fulfill their potentials and
live a better life. We can not forget
that careless actions lead to destruction and in a destroyed world nobody can
achieve anything. 

 

The
game is very interesting and enhances the dilemmas involving risk management.
In Portuguese, there is a saying of the short blanket (I do not know if it is
the same in English): when you cover the head, you uncover the feet and vice
versa.

 

A
new version of the game could give the player other options to prevent, avoid
and cope with the destruction caused by the waves created by the meteors. One
example: by allowing the player to invest in an alarming system which might reduce the number of deaths. This is just a suggestion. In my opinion, the game
does not need to be changed.Best regards,Demétrio Weber
