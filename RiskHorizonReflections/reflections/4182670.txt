The role of risk management was to combine knowledge (comet research), protection (insurance), externals (community development) to achieve prosperity and make coping with shocks possible. The choices I made were how to build with one eye on developing and fortifying pods while comets threatened to wipe out any progress made.Thankfully, the 75% insurance available for purchase made quick repairs possible although I'm well aware in many parts of the world is not a viable option. I played the game multiple times and realized that the pods themselves could be made stronger with more investment.The main things I learned were:. Insurance helps you recover ground quickly and then provides capital to fortify structures further.. Community is useful for coping and reduces coping time. Building and research must balance each otherThe funds surprisingly were available soon after a shock. In reality, funds are not so readily available. Perhaps something introducing savings would be helpful.
