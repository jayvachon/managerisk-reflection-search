Part 2
Reflection

It was a bit difficult for me to do the preparations for the risk
management in the game as I had less knowledge on how to play it. I had to
juggle around until I realised that the three components cannot be separated for
effective and efficient risk management. I realised that protection and
insurance, that would be informed by research â€“ the more I researched, the
lesser was the chance of hit and severity, was the best way to prepare for risk
reduction. Preparing before shocks enables coping afterward and is an essential
tool for development which fosters opportunities. Potential risks were reduced
before the shock actually occurred

I played the game several times.
I started concentrating more on growing the community, building on every vacant
plots/land. Later, started focusing on research. Much of my resources were
channelled towards this activity and the more I focused on knowing about these
threats the more the severity and chances of hit reduced. Knowledge is crucial,
without it the whole community will be destroyed. Insurance was also helping
upon rebuilding after the shock. It is crucial since in most case the attack
occurs when least expected. I also realised that the more I upgraded my pods,
the more resources I received. This enabled me to stand the severity of a
disaster occurrence. When structures are built up to standards, their
resistance to risks increases. This also reduces the resources needed to rehabilitate
after a shock.

I think I would include coping
mechanisms for the communities during and after a shock. There is need to raise
awareness to increase the opportunities in risk management.
