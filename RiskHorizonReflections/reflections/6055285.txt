1. Without risk management you are not able to accumulate enough resources to move to the next level. Even if you go thru The trade-offs were between 1)development, 2)elevating the level and 3) managing comets' risk on case by case basis. Within each block (1,2 and 3) there were possible further choices: development more pods or upgrade of the pods; mitigating risk by insurance or via research. Time is crutial. After failing couple of times to upgrade one pod I went for the more steady dev-t -- max number of pods with the rest of the money spent to elevate the level as a best protection with the long-lasting effect.There is one important thing -- keeping balance of basic protection and communitiy connection. If it is rightly chosen allows to go thru many hits without the damage.Obviously the research should be focused with balance between the severity / probability ratio and the closeness of the comet. For instance if you have comet approaching the horizon with low severity/probability and the second one potentially more damaging -- it is better to reserch the more damaging, less damaging should only be givel limited research (but at least some -- like two grades on the research scale)2. The main things I learnt from the game -- try to keep the level of development steady (start upgrade of the pods to the next level only when all your pods were upgraded to the same level). All remaining resources put on building the protection that will be long-lasting and will protect you not only from one comet, but from all coming comets. Use insurance only in case you see the worst combination (severity and probability of hitting), do not go for the most expensive one 33% to 50% will do the trick.3. I would consider more flexibility on insurance -- for instance insuring all comet at one level or present and the next level. Also instead of fixed %% in insurance I would give an option similar to evevation level -- the more you spend the better insurance you get.
