well, the Risk Management in this game was managing under Uncertainty. This started with understanding of the game, preparing for the game, applying whatever is known and studied so far- like, prior and post risk management. Frankly, since there was study of these matters such as Preparation and Coping and other things, the  game suffered biases by me to that extent. What happened actually later on was my feelings how to manage the issues and to that extent the game was played in my own way. I am not sure that this can be termed as risk aversion and fear of failure. But at the hindsight this appears to strongly so.The risk aversion and fear of failure under uncertainty will be the issues if I played again. I did play more than once to improve the score but it was more of despair rather than learning. Again somewhere the biases and heuristics at play.I did almost  reach to crack the level three but the pod build up was not correct as per the software. The suggestion was to build vertically but pods were all horizontal- this may be due to different opinion and perspective and again I believe this can not be eliminated by suggestions and improvements.Honestly, I enjoyed the game and understand the purpose of reinforcement. But, it should not become what was informed in the course " Paradox of Protection" by itself.Thank You to my Peers who have taken trouble to go through my thought process.
