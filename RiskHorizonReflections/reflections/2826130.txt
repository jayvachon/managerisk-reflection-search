I've learned that always protecting your resources is not always the best choice if you want to develop more quickly because i've periodically have cost and miss oportunities like making some researches. Also, the combination of research and insurances creates oportunities to manage risk efficiently, for example overcoming some obstacules and knowing when a risk will impact me.
