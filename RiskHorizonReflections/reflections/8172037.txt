The role of risk management in the game was to be proactive in my actions.- if one knows the severity is less than 50%, then insure less.- no need to build so many communities you cannot protect - insure more if severity is more than 50% and chances is more than 50%- upgrade neighbourhood to higher standards when there are more than 50% chances-don't repair when cost is more than for a new development- don't build new communities when there are no funds to complete and protect them.- always upgrade existing communities than building newer ones.- when i upgrade, there are higher chances that repair cost will be low.
