In terms of knowledge i did some research, as for protection I was lifting up the surface. In terms of insurance I was using an insurance policy covering 75% of the damage that was being done. I have played the game for a few times, and every time I learn something new, firstly I didn't know about the research, and after the first time when I only did some insurance, I have starting doing some research also. The next couple of times besides insuring and researching I have learned to do some protection also, which included lifting up the surface of the planet so that when the meteor hit it would not cause a lot of damage to my objects. Every next time that I played the game, I firstly went researching after that protection and if it is not enough than I also insured my property. It payed of really well.Â
