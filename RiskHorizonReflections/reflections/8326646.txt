Risk management presents available choices for achieving optimal results under various situations. Each choices (knowledge, protection and insurance) are used in combination and in deployed various proportions depending on the situation. For example, when severity and likelihood are high, insurance and protection are critical. Insurance should not be high, at 50% it is appropriate. More use research and protection can result in faster building and upgrading of buildings. It is important to understand the risk management choices that are available before starting development. After several attempts, I kept insurance at 50% and that proved adequate to repair damages. In using more research and protection the process of building and upgrading was faster. I accumulated a lot of resources by doing researching which enabled me to upgrade faster. Initially, insurance seem the appropriate choice at first. However, as the game progressed research became much more valuable.  Ability of share and disseminate knowledge is an important feature that needs to build within the game. This will make the often prohibitive price of insurance lower as people who only insure against what they are almost certain will occur. Any risk event that could be mitigated by the gain of knowledge will not need insurance.
