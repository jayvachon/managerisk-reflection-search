During the game, I learn that how knowledge, protection and
insurance are necessary to build a sustainable environment to which can
flourish and live happily. Game also taught me how we can deploy the available
resources by having knowledge of future risk and its severity and probability
of facing it. It also taught me the trade-off we have to make in order to
prepare and cope after a calamity. I traded off developing less no of colonies
with purchasing broad insurance cover, as after getting hit by a comet the cost
and time to redevelop a colony was higher. So having less no of colonies to
build after getting hit by a comet gave me flexibility of redeveloping hit
colonies by having more cash to pay for redevelopment.

During the game I acquired knowledge about the chances of
hitting and severity of the hit of a comet, this helped me in increasing my
protection and opting for a proper insurance plan. I learned how acquiring
knowledge helps in risk management by opting for a protection, choosing a
proper insurance plan and in coping. 

If given a choice I would like to include in the game of
having knowledge of time to rebuilt the damage colonies and time taken in
upgrading the colonies from a level to another, as this will give me better
knowledge to develop how many colonies and which colonies to upgrade under
certain time frame. As we had a limited time to develop and sometime I faced
challenge in selecting between colonies to upgrade and colonies to develop.
