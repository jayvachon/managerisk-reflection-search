The role of risk management in Risk Horizon was to determine how time and resources were allocated in order to reach the next level, whether it was researching the severity and accuracy of the incoming comet to upgrading facilities and purchasing insurance and/or protection.While the facilities were upgrading, I either increased the protection of my colony or researched incoming comets in order to assess the severity of the situation. I had to make trade-offs in my knowledge of the comet for increasing protection of my colony. In addition, I had to consider whether it was worth purchasing certain percentages of insurance, as that would decrease the recovery time of my potentially damaged facilities.Preparing for the risks affected how quickly I upgraded my facilities and what I considered to be higher priorities: attaining the level required to pass, or just surviving the next big event. After attaining a large quantity of finances in my "bank", I had to determine whether it was worthwhile to invest it into 75% insurance coverage, raising the protection of my colony, or upgrading my facilities to the maximum capacity.I have played the game many times, so I have constantly changed things in order to achieve the next level. Instead of concentrating on upgrading or purchasing insurance at the start of the level, I would try to build on empty pieces of land, raise the protection of my colony (if it was relatively low), and observe the incoming comets to determine the severity of the damages (and also to increase the time for the community to aid and reduce the damages).Some main things I learned from the game are the importance of increasing my knowledge of incoming dangers (severity and accuracy), having a basic level of protection (and increasing it for incoming severe comets), purchasing some level of insurance (at least 50%), and upgrading my colonies to increase the finances in the "bank".Although I do not live in an area where tornadoes are present, one change I would make to the new version of the game is replacing floods with tornadoes. Tornadoes are much more difficult to prepare for, as the only thing that could be done is evacuation or hiding in trenches, in comparison to floods where levees could be made, buildings could be elevated, and other such precautions are available.
