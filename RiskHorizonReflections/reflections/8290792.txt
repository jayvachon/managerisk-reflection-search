The role of risk management in the game was to proactively
confront and prepare for the risk of tsunami from occasional falling of meteors.
It also entailed ensuring certain level of speed and progress in community
development to meet the needed milestone in the given time for each stage. Regarding
knowledge, I allocated substantial portion of my time and attention in monitoring
meteors. As per continuous risk assessments I paid extra attention to meteors
with both high impact and probability. As per changing probability and impact,
I continuously adjusted my strategy and corresponding resource allocation
decisions. Regarding “Protection”, I focused on making slow yet continuous building
of “Protection / Resilience” asset. However during each round I consciously
tried not to overdo at the cost of missing the milestone. Once I managed to
reach the required milestone for the stage, I did concurrent job of upgrading buildings
for greater yield as well as lifting the island further to prepare in advance
for future meteor shocks with severe magnitude. In terms of “Insurance”, I deliberate
chose to utilize this flexible risk management option in later stages rather
than from the very beginning. Also I used it as more of last minute quick
backup for “Protection” since “Insurance” require zero lead time to implement
when existing prevention needs a speedy reinforcement. While playing, I faced several trade-offs: Too much emphasis on
protection almost always resulted in increased risk of missing the needed
milestone for the given round. Too much focus on community development also
resulted in increased vulnerability in the face of high impact meteor shock.  Upgraded buildings ensured increased level of
production yet it asked for increased cost pressure when purchase of insurance
became necessary. Option of raising the island itself rather than purchase of
“Insurance” for a single round only promised building of more sustainable,
lasting “Protection” asset. However, its slow progress meant increased risk
taking until the lifting guarantees certain level of safety later on. I think
risk management has to be a dynamic process to consider and manage various constantly
evolving trade-offs effectively.



Eventually I managed to reach level 5. However, during my first few
attempts, I got very disappointing results over and over. I had to refine my
risk management strategy and some underlying assumptions to approach the game
differently. What I did differently were: First and foremost, I started to put
more efforts into “Research” of various types of meteors to fundamentally improve
my level of knowledge and therefore quality and timeliness of my risk
management decisions predominantly on resource allocation and priority settings.
Second, I applied more through time management while I was playing: I
consciously avoided idle time of not doing anything but tried to progress, make
the most out of given limited resource to maximize as much level of
“Protection”, “Knowledge” and “Insurance” as possible. Third and last, I tried
to rely less on “quick solution” such as “insurance” but started building more of
solid and sustainable “Protection” asset from the very beginning with long term
orientation and patience. I think the single most important insight from this
risk exercise is the importance of building a lasting foundation for risk
management from the start despite increased risk taking and slow progress. For
future version up, I have only 2 suggestions for improvement: Make the exercise
even more realistic by making “Insurance” requiring some lead time to take its
full effect rather than providing immediate protection at the point of purchase.
Furthermore price of “Insurance” should change over time and changing risk rating
from insurance providers rather than being fixed all the time.
