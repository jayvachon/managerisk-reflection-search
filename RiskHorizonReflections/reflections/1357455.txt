Reflections on Risk Horizon
Risk management is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate events (wikipedia). This definition can simply be summarized as the preparation for risks followed by the coping with risks.

The Risk Horizon game is a clear demonstration of how an effective Risk Management strategy can help mitigate, or if possible, avoid the effects/impacts of risks.

During the game play, my application of the methods learned from the Risk Management course played a very important role. I realized that for sustainable development to take place in my game community, I needed a good knowledge of all factors that may have a positive as well as a negative impact on my objective. The falling comets had the potential to negatively affect the development of my game community. After identifying the comets as a threat and assessing the probability of impact as well as the severity, I was able to make good decisions as to which comets had to be given priority. I had to take adequate measures to protect my game community by raising the land well above sea level. This measure costs me money, which I could have used for further development, but I also realized that it’s a lot cheaper to be proactive and put in place adequate protective measures than it is to be reactive to the occurrence of an event (comet impact). I also realized that taking out an insurance policy on my community development actually made it more resilient in that I had to pay a lot less in the event of a risk occurrence(impact) and recovery was a lot quicker.

After playing the game a couple of times, I had to learn to keep my eyes on the Big Picture and took a broad view of my community while still carrying out all my grass root developments. I had to ensure I wasn’t too carried away by building and upgrading Pods and not looking out for the falling comets (Risks).
If I had the chance to make a change or add a feature to the game, I’ll put in the option of added risk protection measures with their associated effectiveness and costs. Some risk measures could be relatively inexpensive, yet quite effective.
