1) There are three options of risk management offered in the game: Protection, Research and Insurance. The role of risk management in the game is to find such a balance of using the options to achieve certain level of development.The immediate effect of preparation is a reduction of development growth, i.e. more we spend on preparation, lesser resources are available for revenue generation.On the other hand, if the preparation was not paid enough attention to address the high probability of meteor impact and its severity, the damage of actual meteor impact was very high and draw substantial resources out from development.If balanced properly, the investment in development in the long run results in higher returns which allows to increase investments in protection and yet support required development growth rate.2) I have played the game several times. By adjusting different tactics in the use of preparation options, I could manage to increase the revenue and successfully overcome Level 4 at the fourth attempt.Initially I chose a very cautious approach and invested too much in protection and insurance. Thus, the resources were not wisely spent to development growth.Afterwards, I started carefully balancing use of funds with a bigger emphasis on development yet investing sufficient funds to mitigate possible impact of the meteor attacks.The game is an interesting approach to learn to optimize management decisions in the environment of limited resources and risks presented.3) Indeed, the game is only a very simplified model of what real world with actual risks could be.If change to the game is possible, I would suggest to give a payer a choice of adding new risks. The user would have an ability to set the new risk's features that would, as per the user's thinking, reflect the reality of the area where the user lives. That, I believe, would allow to simulate conditions that are closer to specific region or industry, thus allowing the user to search for better management solutions in risk management.Another suggestion is to create more games for different areas / industries. For example, the type of risks could vary for a game for educational sector and for a game for roads construction or health industries, etc.Thanks!
