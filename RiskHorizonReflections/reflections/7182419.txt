The game presents a scenario where you have to tackle the task of protecting your pods from frequent meteor strikes while investing sizable resources upgrading them so as to increase overall development. Risk management in the game comes in the forms of researching on the meteors to gain time to mitigate the meteor strike (knowledge), investing resources over time to raise the surface level above flood-lines (protection) and purchasing insurance to unload some of the risks to insurers (insurance). From my experience playing the game, protection affects development the most over long periods of the game because if the surface level is above the flood-lines, there will be no averse effect on development. Nevertheless, protection is both time costly and expensive and investments have to be purchased in the event of a high-probability high-severity meteor. However, it is important to note that even low-probability meteors have a chance of hitting and such incidents may derail your plans to complete the level in time. Such trade-offs between the different forms of risk management have to be juggled cautiously in order to beat the later levels of the game.If I were to play this game again, I will definitely invest more resources on protection and only purchase insurance for meteors which I think will have a more severe impact on development. Another thing I have learnt from the game, which I believe the game has excellently represented, is the opportunity cost in terms of time and money when you decide to engage in a certain form of risk management. For example, researching on the meteors means that you will be unable to perform other actions such as purchasing pods, raising surface level etc. I think such trade-offs clearly illustrates the limits in capacity that many governments and organizations face when dealing with risks.Given the opportunity to develop a newer and improved version of the game, I will introduce another form of risk with a lower frequency of occurrence and higher severity, perhaps a volcanic eruption. Such a scenario will present the player with the dilemma of choosing whether to prioritize risk management for the high-frequency meteors or the low-frequency volcanic eruption. Living in a small OECD country with several less-developed neighbors that are prone to natural disasters, I wish to reflect the far-reaching border-crossing effects of risks be they natural or man-made. A multi-player component of the game can be developed. 4 players will play at the same time and each player can contribute their resources to a global research fund which will benefit all the players, signifying how knowledge is often a public good. Players will also have the option to donate funds to other players and this will be a critical and strategic component of the game as meteor strikes and volcanic eruptions will affect not just the source player, but other players as well. This improved game will allow different players to experiment cooperation and other strategic handling of their resources.
