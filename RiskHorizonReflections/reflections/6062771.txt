Reflections on ‘Risk Horizon’ game 

This game showed me
how balancing different aspects of risk management is essential in building
healthy, sustainable communities. 
Preventative work to protect from natural disasters; purchasing
insurance; building research knowledge about natural disasters, and enhancing
community connections are all essential parts of risk management – but which
should be prioritised at what time, as well as focussing on the future by building new
‘pods’, was the real challenge in this game.

When I first started
playing, I was confronted by the feeling that there was no chance to keep
developing the pods, because disasters kept coming so quickly. I was using all
the resources I had just to keep at a stable level, because there was no time
or resources to move forward with the number and severity of comets.

Once I had a solid
base of resources to buy insurance, and enough preventative ground level
raising (protection) to withstand most comets, then I could start focussing my
resources into development, which in turn earned me more money. I found that
the knowledge gained - that is, the ratings of severity, and the chances of the
comet hitting the village, really helped in assessing how much should be spent
on protection. Without this data, I would not have been able to make the
strategic resource decisions that I did.  In addition, focussing on this research added to community
connections – another important component which I will cover later.

Insurance was very
useful in the aftermath of the disaster, but it was tough to make the decision
at what level to purchase it, with limited resources and when there were pods
still to be repaired. At times I strategically chose a cheaper insurance and
chose to spend more on preventative protection work, to stop the homes being
damaged rather than having to be damaged and then repaired. I figured that the
repairs took time, and energy of the people, which would impact on their
wellbeing and economic productivity.

All of these elements
in risk management (knowledge, insurance, protection and community connections)
affected the development of the community in their own ways. But it was only
through careful balance of all four that the community was able to thrive and
move on to the next level.

An important learning
for me was that of community connections as a type of insurance. Once I figured
out that to keep the research stats up on the screen gave me more time for
community connections, I found that I started having a ‘no damage’ result more
often as community members were able to share resources (as long as the
protective work was done). This allowed me to progress through the game in a
way I had not before.

But this made me
wonder why the time to create community connections was only ‘bought’ by accumulating
research. This does not reflect real life development situations. So if I had a
chance to change one aspect of the game, it would be to have a chance for
‘community connections’ to be made before the disaster stuck. As we know that
these connections are important in responding to disasters at the time and the
rebuilding afterwards.Level 1: 39xGKVCLevel 2: meg3kBcLevel 3: Mgrt5kx
