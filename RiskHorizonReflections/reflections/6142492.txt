Risk Management Game.The game is a web-based simulation that conveys a risk environment of threatening meteorites that will crash on the planet and destroy the city your are placed. The main objective of the game is to save the city from destruction, as well as building up a strong economy to pass through the levels.The role of risk management in the game is very clear, because you have to be well aware of iminent risks, conveying planetary and economy risks, to play the game I used a simple strategy that is enough to play and earn a lot of money at the samen time. Once I had the money I invested it on building bigger houses and that would give me more money, but I was always watching the skies to learn about the meteorites, I prepared myself with the suficient protection for every meteorite, not one line more not one less, and also It did not matter if it was going to crash with our planet or not; using that strategy, buying policies was not necesary, not even once, therefore the money was always in use of protection or investment, preparation is essencial to survive to the end of the game, and you can only do that If you are well aware of what is happening in the skies and preparing with the enough protection, not more not less.I played the game two times, for the first one, I tried to protect myself too much that my economy was not enough to pass through the fourth level, because my protection was always at the maximum level. Conversely to the second one where I learnt that aquiring valuable information of the potencial risks and how to be prepared for them, I played a different role, where the main objective was to make money with the leas resouce invested in protection, and with that in mind, my game ran smoothly and I beat the game easily.If I could chance something to the game, that would be to add one more risk, hence another kind of protection, and that would make the game more realistic, conveying not just one but more risks involved in our everyday life, that would make the game even more fun and entertaining and the simulation would be more profund to make better reflections of the risk management importance in our lives.
