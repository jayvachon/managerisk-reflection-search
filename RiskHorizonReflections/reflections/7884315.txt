Risk horizon game captures some aspects of risk management, it gives you the different possibilities to act upon. Where also it implements various scenarios for damage control as it gives you three different tools to work with: Researching a meteor, which costs are minimal but you cannot manage your “city”, also Lifting the city to decrease damage, but it costs a combination of money and time, and finally, protection insurance that costs lot of money but gives you the time to manage the city.In-order to survive in such planet, one must asses the damage impact of the meteor with it chance to hit while also keeping an eye on your money and timer. If i have plenty of time, my decisions will be different as if i had little time left. No time to recover means you cannot produce well in time, while having more time gives you the possibility of  upgrading the city to its fullest, and after the hit you recover and be more productive than if you spent time protecting your self. So, it’s mere a combination of assessments and foreseeing future opportunities and obstacles one might face.The general start i begin with is to focus on upgrading the city, after couple seconds comes the decision of insurance or not based on the general intensity of the meteors and the speed of generating money (to recover fast from insurance payment). While keeping a maintained level of lifting. The moment new meteor shows, checking its stats is mandatory, if its high intensity i do all the upgrades i could on the city then begin researching it. Its a game of balancing and good judgment, and a bit of luck maybe.In conclusion, the game truly test your fast risk management skills and how well you cope with the consequences that you must face. If you judged a situation badly, there's no one to blame but your self. and the game almost fully represent the risk management choices that matter most in the country i live in.
