In the game, risk management tried to reach or maintain
development through economy working on the population to grow, establishing communities,
which, given the environment, faces risk, a natural risk that menace the
development, so as the risk comes true the economy suffers accordingly to the
size of the economy itself. the link and relation between insurance and protection is to affect the situation before the event, I mean the short run is always risky and putting present income to the future need to be the people's saving.So with insurance the recovery looked a quite slow, since the menace was increasing over time. The relation established in the game  looks quite confusing since operate protection is slow the reduction effect on the event is not really measured. I couldn't understand that.In the exercise, the preparation for risk affect
the economy before the impact, mostly. I could not manage the prevention, so growing
the economy building communities is faster, any protection lower the economy
and allows the event to hit harder, damaging the community. However if I could
have reach higher level, I expect it to manage much better times between
economy growing, prevention and restauration. I am sure my bigger mistake was
doing prevention focusing on protection and insurance, ignoring at first knowledge,
so the game comes with research looking integrated at observing the comets,
which are difficult to measure and understand the quantification and how the knowledge
aggregate value to decision.I did the game three times trying to understand the opportunity to do protection and get insurance, while the economy grows. I tried with few options to manage risk. I mostly did protection, but where costly and were so expensive that I lost the level. Maybe the kind of risk make me complex to understand the risk management, so simple, but not clear.

 The actions needed after the event were more costly
than doing prevention, as I reach the second level. My learning in all the trial
were to make more use of knowledge than just expending prior in prevention and
insurance. The probability estimation of the event must be improved in the
present and along with the prevention, integrated with natural growing and not
an independent part of it.

 The game should be improved by defining research explicitly,
measuring its advance and updating clear to the player. Having the option at
superior level for protection being part of development. Also understand the
result of knowledge suddenly happen to come two or three comets that does not
is well understood the role of generating knowledge. This is an important part
of risk management.
