Sorry for my English, I am
from Venezuela and I had to use Google translate.

Risk management was crucial
when I had to face the game. Definitely we need to be properly prepared to face
potential threats and if a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance is
achieved then you will most likely reach the last level. At first I built a few
pods to avoid higher insurance costs and spend less energy updating the pods. I
also found it important to study each of the comets to measure the impact and
the damage they might cause. All this preparation helped me to pass the level
and understand the importance of good risk management.

If I would played once, I
will examine further how comets can impact the pods to gain more time and thus
better prepare for the consequences of that shock. Moreover, if I would played
more than once, I will invest more money on insurance in order to better deal
with the consequences of a devastating impact. In this game I learned how
important and how difficult it is to achieve the perfect balance between knowledge,
protection and insurance.

Venezuela is a country with
poor risk management, therefore I would add to the game three changes: the
first would be an advanced alarm system that enables people to know in advance
that a disaster is about to occur. Second, establish a communication network
between the population and the competent authorities in order to improve
responsiveness during a particular disaster. Third, campaigning to raise
awareness and help people to prepare for a disaster of any kind.
