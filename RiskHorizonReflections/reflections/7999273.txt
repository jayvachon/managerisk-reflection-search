According to the horizon game we confront some trade-offs,
and we should determine according to the available resources which choice we
will take which is based on the information we have and our good knowledge for
the whole face of this information(i.e some information could have a positive
impact by itself but when we try to make it applicable with other trade-offs it
could lead to a negative impact) for example in the game if you build alot of
pods only without upgrading it could be fine but when you indicate to the
comets you could find that its chance to hit is in its maximum which need to
make some more deep research; in accordance with some kind of insurance plan to
try to limit the damage it could happen.

So; we need to have a detailed plan about the risks we face
and its probable damages to determine the best protection way and the insurance
plan. GOOD; But did we calculate the cost????

in the preceding paragraph we didn't take the cost as an
effective and urgent tool in our preparation plan; that we should pay attention
for it as a limited resources; so as limited time.

When you play a game once we gain some experience from what
you loss or win; while if you are playing it again and again you learned some different
strategies for preparing to the game and being master your plan within the
limited budget and try to build connections with community to build an
effective risk plan.

If we are trying to build a new version from the  game or upgrading one it will be better to
exceed the time to 5 minutes plus make a detailed feedback after each 2 levels
with the errors you done while playing to master the whole game.

and if I have in my place some environmental risks like hurricanes
and earthquakes it will be better to have an early warning center try to build
connections with neighborhood countries if we need to evacuate people to  other places whether in the same country or in
different country  as a first phase; till
we upgrade our plan to have a preceding response to any environmental risks.
