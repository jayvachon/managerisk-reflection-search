Riskhorizon game reflectionThis game was an exercise in mitigating and reacting to frequent risks of damage. The effects of this damage were very real, making the risk incredibly tangible. Risk management through resource allocation, knowledge building i.e. research, and investing in insurance, became necessary to allow for even the slightest development. Without such actions, the damage quickly became overwhelming, leaving little hope for more than a planet of rubble.	Upon first glance, the game seemed simple; I anticipated reaching the latter levels after a mere couple of tries. To my surprise, however, the strategic element was more difficult to master than I had anticipated. In fact, various tries led me to prioritize a different risk management element each turn, leading to a few realizations, further explored below.	Firstly, it quickly became apparent that research played a crucial and potent role in diminishing damage from comets, largely because research gathering was more time efficient than raising protection levels. However, the protection level, once acquired, even if at much length, carried a guarantee of damage control. Research merely enabled one the chance to attempt to mitigate the comet's damage, and how effective this was still depended almost entirely on my own reflexes. In other words, research merely created opportunity, whereas raising protection levels created concrete, reliable defense. Nevertheless, when high-severity comets were on the horizon, the possibility of achieving the necessary level of protection was next to nothing, requiring me to rely entirely on research. In the instance of a rapid succession of incoming comets, nearly all my time was spent on research and no time at all spent on protection levels.	A rapid succession of incoming comets also had the effect of paralyzing reconstruction efforts, in my case. If there was even the slightest chance of damage, it seemed futile to repair when such efforts would be rendered futile, and I would have to repeat the action again in mere seconds. Certainly, investing in insurance would make this repetitive action less costly, but no less tedious. 	Insurance, in fact, proved the most cost- and time-effective measure in damage mitigation. It did not take time or attention away from devoting oneself to other damage prevention measures, and the cost was always worth it. 	All in all, it was interesting to experiment with prioritizing certain elements over others. I was left feeling that more and more practice would be to my benefit, not only for in-game success but to understand the real-world parallels - although, of course, the realism of the scenario was lacking in many ways. One lacking element, I found, was the lack of relevance of pod proximity, both physical and relational - that is to say, community played no role in affecting risk management measures. Were I to tweak the game, I would include this factor in some way as it is a crucial facet of risk management.
