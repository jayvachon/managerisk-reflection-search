The game is a learning exercise for making decisions in constraints of time and money, just that risk management is about. In this game, information plays a major role allowing decisions before and after the harmful event occurred. The probabilities, the protection costs and the predicted damage should be quantified to achieve good performance in risk management.After playing a few times, the experience also takes center stage as it allows better decisions. That is, knowledge of the threats and the value of endangered goods are both fundamental.Â I would not add things to the game, because they would increase the complexity and therefore the exercise would become more difficult for the general public. I just would improve the instructions for easy access to children, housewives and many other people in the world who need to understand risk management through educational games.
