1 In this game, the role of risk management was reflected in purchasing the insurance to protect against the potential damage caused by comet. The trade-off will be switching over time between doing the research and developing the pods. The preparation for the risk was done by the recovery plan once the hit happens and it can dramatically decrease the damage or even avoid any damage.2. I only played once, but I think I will apply different strategy to allocate my time between developing the pod and doing the research of coming comet.3.I would like to have more options in terms of selecting insurance plans to recover the damage to different degrees.
