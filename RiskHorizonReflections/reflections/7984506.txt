Risk management is the process of identifying the risk,preparing for it and coping with its effects.It can avert damages and help in development as well as unleash new opportunities.As we saw in this game development and upgrading of pods is hindered due to the risk posed by comets.When these comets hit the water they generate waves which cause damage to the Alora's community.Hence,effective risk management is required to protect the community from getting destroyed as well as helping it improve its current developmental state.we know that the procress of risk management has four components namely- knowledge,protection,insurance and coping.Knowledge includes obtaining information about the type of risk,its severity,its likelihood to occur,its frequency,its impact,etc.Knowledge involves obtaining information and using that to assess potential risks and then decide how to act.When the comets' risk came to my knowledge i obtain the relevant information which includes the severity of the damage that will b caused and its chances of hitting.I accordingly plan my research time devoted.Also,side by side i increase my protection level and try to get as many bars of protection meter to minimise the damage.This helped me in clearing my levels as even the comets with high severity meter were avoided.Thus,the second component was covered up there.Insurance is another helpful tool which helps in preparing for the risk.Though it cannot minimise the damage on pods but it can definitely reduce the cost of repairs.More the insurance cover more relaxed i was in situations of damage as my wealth pool remained intact,it only got reduced by a meagre amount in comparison to with what it increased due to my upgraded pods.In this way,maintaining a right balance between developing new pods,upgrading the old ones and preparing for the risks by obtaining knowledge,using protection,insurance cover i could easily cope up with the risk and prevent development setbacks.This game was an interesting case of risk management.It brought me to various trade-offs which were required to be done between developing new pods or increasing the protection level or devoting more time in research to make accurate forecasts.However,the right balance was struck.Development would be nothing if its not well protected so my preferance was protection.so development did face a setback immediately but in long term when comets were avoided it was unharmed.Had i focussed on development rather than protection my upgraded pods would have got damaged.I played this game more than once.In my initial attempts i focussed more on developing and upgrading pods as that would have helped me clear the levels faster but instead it got me stuck on level 1 itself.All my developments were damaged because of minimal research and protection level.Thus,i realised the need of changing my strategy.i shifted to preparation more than development.And then i was successfully able to complete my levels.Thus,i learnt from this game that development should not be the primary concern in risk prone areas and situations rather preparation should be.It is prepation that helps in coping with the risk and not development.Yes,development experiences a temporary setback when focus is shfted but it is beneficial in developing community relations for long term.If given a chance what i would like to change in this game with the mindset that it is the world i live in is I would add different elements as we face various types of risks in real scenario and depending on the type our strategies differ.Also the game covered only the negative aspects of risk.However,we also have risks which unleash a new opprtunity so that aspect should also b introduced.
