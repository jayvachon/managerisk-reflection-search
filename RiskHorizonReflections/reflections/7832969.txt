The game in all gave a good insight on the way risk management is to be looked over in a very interesting way, the role of risk management is to analysis and learn from your mistakes, i played the game couple of times, but to realize similar results in real life would be a very difficult task considering one can't do over the whole scene again the whole reality.In the game the role of risk management from my perspective is to consider on which of the options available would benefit me now and would have any use of them in the levels to come for instance getting a insurance is not always required to clear a level but having an insurance assured me that being hit by a comet won't affect me to that extend than when not having one. I had to trade of protection in some cases to have more knowledge but at such times i was backed by the insurance.Being played the game more than once i could understand that having knowledge with protection was one key, rather than just building the protection for unpredictable calamity.the game on its own manages very well the idea of risk management it is meant to deliver, said that i would have liked to have the 'connection to society' which we only have to do after a calamity strikes even before an uncertain event which should add to the protection meter plus it might in my belief would suggest the importance of having healthy relationship among the community and the readiness to protect one another in need.
