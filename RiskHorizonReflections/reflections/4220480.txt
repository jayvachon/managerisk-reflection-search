1.I thought this game wanted to tell us the difficulty of risk management.Limited money. If we had lots of money, it will be easy game for us.Limited time. If we had plenty of time to think about, it will be easy to play.2.I played several times, maybe 7 or 8 times. I always lost at level 5.I thought many things. Balance is important?  Protection is the most important? Luck is also important.But, I couldn't find the answer. And I think there is no right answer.3.If I was asked to develop this game, I want to add more message or hint for result page.I want to stress what is the key message for this game and for real life.
