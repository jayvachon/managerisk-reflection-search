To start to
talk about what I learned with the Game, first I need to say that I’m not a
“Game Player” person, so I don’t have any track record on this field, and I suppose
this is the reason of my lack achievement on the game result.Saying that, what I learned at first point is that, if we want to have a protected community, we need to focus on infrastructure for the inhabitants, building safe houses, strengthening its own infrastructure in order to face a threat in a more resilient way, reducing time and resources to rebuild it afterwards the disaster.The second lesson that I learned was about the knowledge necessary about the what kind of threat the community could face more likely than others (in the case of the game was the "comet"), when we know in depth what could or would threat our community, we can provide the proper protection in order to prevent the event, get good preparedness and readiness for facing the threat, and when it really happen, our community would be able to recover from it in a better way, using the proper resource and rebuild it in less time with fewer efforts and fewer damages. So, getting together all the relevant information about the threat, using data from research and the observance of the previous events, allow the community to get ready to face the threat, and make them recovering faster and cheapest than whether all this would occur without this knowledge.The third lesson learned from the game was about the insurance. When we are able to get the better coverage for our community, we can face the threat more easily, because we don't need to use all the resources that we have to rebuild from the event, the cost will be shared with the others members of the community, making easier to recover after the event hit the community.The last lesson learned was about the integration of all strategies to make the community stronger to face a shock, because if the community have all the information related to the threats it faced, combining with the protection action as reinforce the infrastructure or building a good alarm system and training people for using preventing disasters tools, and be able to share all these systems in a coordinate way, and furthermore having a good insurance coverage, the members of the community created a very good plan of alternatives that reduce the damages and make them stronger getting a very good resilient strategic plan and actions, reducing the efforts to rebuild the day-by-day life of the community after facing the shock, including reducing damages at social, economic and finance levels.
