1. Risk management played a crucial role in the game, without it there would have been a walk in the park. Since risk was such a constant threat, I had to make different choices and trade-offs in order to be able to reach the next level. The things that I prioritised was insurance and protection. I felt that in order for my community to be able to survive possible threats, protection (because it minimised the damage) and insurance (because it minimised the cost even more if damage would occur) was the best way to go.2. I played the game only once. If I had played it more times, I would probably focused more on research. That would have helped me to know during which periods to focus the spending on insurance and protection, and during which periods to focus the spending on improving the community through upgrading the houses. The main thing that I learned from this game, is that it is nothing that is right or wrong and that it is a constant trade-off between what should be prioritised.3. I think that an improvement of the game would be if there were more than one kind of threat and more than one kind of damage. People in poor countries of face threats such as regarding their economy, their food intake, their house, and their personal and national security. And the damages done by these different kind of threats can be vey different, ranging from starvation and poor health to political and national unrest.
