In this
game, risk management plays a very important role. The goal of the game is to
develop in a certain time frame. To increase the development factor and income,
we need money. But the asteroids are threatening the development by smashing
our development plants. 

 

Risk
Management contains 4 factors: Knowledge, Insurance, Protection and Coping. We
get the Knowledge about the probability the asteroid will hit us in the menu of
the asteroid as well as the severity. When times go bye, the research increases
and we get exact data, what’s going to happen. So the management is a kind of
tricky. At the beginning we just have unspecific data, that’s getting better
and better, if time goes bye and the research increases. But on some time, we
have to do something. We have no chance to wait for exact research data,
because than in might be too late.

 

Well, if we
know that a risk can appear, we have do deal with it. One possibility is to
increase protection or / and to protect with insurance. The problem is, that we
are using resources, we actually need for further development. That’s why we
have to take remaining risk into account. 

 

Finally if
we were hit by the asteroid, we have to reduce the damage and recover from
losses. Here is also the problem, that resources are needed to recover. 

 

 

 Before writing this report, I just played the
game one time and lost at 5. Level. My problem was, that I invested to much
money in protection and insurance. But at the end of the game these money was
missing for further development. When I’m going to play this game again, I
would take more risks by investing more money into development and less into
protection.

 

Well, I
would like to add one thing to make risk and development management more
realistic. I would add the feature to lend money. That would allow me to get
some money at the time I need it (if I did for example a mistake) and pay it back
with interests later in this game.
