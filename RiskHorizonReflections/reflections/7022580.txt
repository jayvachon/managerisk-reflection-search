ON LEARINING:The most important thing I learnt was that we often have a false image of our aim. we want development and in order to pursue it we go on building and building but with no backup,that is insurance or protection in this particular case,  of any sort we might actually turn up losing more.We should look at development As a whole and in long term not just have a myopic instantaneous view.ON TRADEOOFF: Actually there were no tradeoffs since every development I didn't do in order to buy an insurance or for protection was actually to save me from any damage to the colony. You have to have the idea what my aim was and that was I had  reach a suitable amount of development  in midst of heavy uncertaininty and with such a view what was once a tradeoff seems essential.ON PREPAREDNESS: I played the game and at start I had a huge protection measurements which really helped me to sustain and minimize heavy losses at the later stages of the game even after my extra preparedness at the start I had to keep certain amount of money and time booked for protection which helped me distribute my protection and ultimately loss in advancement to many stages I bought insurance of medium order at every stage knowing that at time when insurance is actually required I will be at a higher development stage than I will be after buying of highest price.ON STRATEGY: The game was all about thriving in a world surrounded by risks I for one decided to manage the risks by a careful balance of all the three strategies since too much of one strategy, say protection which slowed my growth and I was unable to qualify for the next round, or insurance which ate away my development money again leading to same result, but with a careful mix I was able to develop along with very less damage.
