1. The role of Risk Management in this game was to learn in practice how to combine and use the knowledge of Risk with the tools you are provided. Moreover, in the choices I made I tried to find a balance between growing my community and also to be prepared for the potential shocks by meteors. I was trying to mitigate risk using Knowledge and protection measures but also to transfer risk by buying insurance so as my damaged pods from flooding to be rebuild quicker and cheaper. Futhermore, insurance recovered lost development time after my pods were repaired. For all the above I had always in mind that each of my action will cost my precious resources so everytime I was conducting a quick Cost-Benefit analysis so as to make a decition.The only way to succeed in this game is to find the perfect balance between Knowledge, protection and insurance.2. I played the game only once and If I played it again I would try to buy more insurance and build quicker my pods in order to by able to grow faster and succeed in a higher level.  3. The thing I would change in the game is that I would put a planning and a indetification risks stage before the begining where I would have the chance to plan my Risk Management activities and identify possible negative or positive risks in sentences that would have the form "Cause - Risk - Effect". This form of identification of risks (positives and negatives) helps you to execute risk management and control risks much easier.
