The role of risk management in the game is keep the balance between the main topics related to risk management  (knowledge, protection and insurance). Manage risks has costs and is necessary to keep the balance among the costs and actions to prevent risks. Prepare to risks is related directly to development of any environment and  keep balance is the main point to be treated.I played the game three times and I learned that is importante uses the knowledge about the risk in order to decide the level of protecton and the insurance that I need to pay in order to keep the development but use the correct resources that I have. If I propose some change in the course I will present tips during the actions made in order to show the partial and definitive goals of the game. I will propose help screenshots in order to show the impacts of the actions made and how to learn with them.
