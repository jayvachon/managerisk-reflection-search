The role of risk management is implied anytime preventive actions had to be taken in order to reduce the impact of a phenomenon that has already been suffered or been detected at least one time. In the game's case, constant meteor impacts and waves threatening the pods.In the game I started by establishing the first pods and then improving them without thinking about insurance or protection assuming the development of the pods would provide me the money from their development enough to buy an inssurance plan or expend in protection later; however, the time of construction and the period of time it took for such pods to provide me with money prevented me from increasing protection faster or at least buy any insurance on time before the stronger meteor impact.This lead to a higher damage that cost much more than the initial inversion as the money had now to be invested in repairs rather than in improving or increasing the number of pods plus protection and insurance. I realized insurance couldn't be sacrificed neither protection for a higher number of pods so, in the second try I decided to start by buying an insurance plan and then constructing fewer pods. Then I invested the rest of the money in protection enough to survive the first meteors allowing me also to do research on such phenomena. Such distribution allowed me to provide the adequate protection to the pods (even constructing more) preventing them from damages and their implications. At first it appeared to be a slow strategy that would fail, but the goal was reached almost in the last seconds that were provided. This shows a clear idea on how investing in prevention may seem dangerous and risky (unnecessary) at first glance, but results effective in the long term. If I were to improve the game I would add some other unpredictable risks derived from social and political affairs as the actions from these two variables tend to have most of the times even more repercussions than climate-related risks. Some examples are economic policies that could reduce people's wealth or social phenomena such as civil wars that could shut down and destabilize the countries' economies.
