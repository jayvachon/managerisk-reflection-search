The role of risk management in the game is resource distribution risk. There are generally two types of resource players can balance to achieve goal: money and time. If the money was spent for development, less cash reserves for necessary repairs, insurance, and vice versa. If the development is halt to raise protection, less time to achieve development goal in each level and also lesser money income for halted period. Player also have to choose wisely if the development goal is reached before the time depleted. Remaining time can also be used to raise protection for next level or choose not to.I've played the game many time and it's very entertaining. Next time, I'll pay more attention to the time. Several time I've lost because I thought the insurance can partially protect my pods against severe and accurate comets but i can't repair pods just in time to pass level.The new version of my game will add the proximity attributes. Pods closer to the shore will sustain more damage from waves than pods far from the shore. This will be more challenging since player have to choose wisely where to develop first. I live in a big city where business comes and goes. As they said in retail business: Location, Location, Location. Also, to add a little bit of reality when asteroids hit the pod directly, the incoming comets with maximum accuracy will have the chance of totally obliterate one single pod and force the player to develop that particular area from scratch. In real life, there are often lethal or irreversible damages such as loss of lives and this feature could represent it very well.
