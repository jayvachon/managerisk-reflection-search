The role of risk management in the game is to
balance on the development of the community and protecting these developments
against external threats. In this game, the threat came through the damages to the
developments from the meteor strikes. One can increase the level of the
development, monitor the movement of meteor via research or buy insurance as a
protection measure. A trade-off will happen when one engage in these
activities. For instance, buying more insurance means less money for
development, increasing the height of sea level means slowing down the
development. The preparation for risk impact the development immediately.

I have played the games 4 times without going through
the tutorials carefully and only managed up to level 2. Subsequently, I went
through the tutorials carefully and managed to get to level 4. The lessons that
I learned is to understand the options available in this game. Having
understand better the options available allowed me to decide the balance
between these options. I learned not to exhaust all the funds immediately,
spent more time in the level 3  4 on the meteor research, bought some
insurance and continue to upgrade the community when possible. I also find out
that sometimes the research on the meteor impact and probability may not be
accurate.

If I have the option to develop the new version
of this game, I would allow the choices availability pop up during the game.
This will give the player an option to choose during their game. In the place
where I am living, ensuring the community participation and make a difference
to how they contribute to the community could better represent the choices that
they will take.
