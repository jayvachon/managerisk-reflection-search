                The main role of risk management
in the game was about making the decision when to invest in improving your
colony and when to invest in building up your defenses. There is an ongoing
threat of comets and you have to balance your investment in whether you will
invest on your colony, protection or insurance. These tradeoffs are the key to
successfully building up your colony through mitigating the risks of comets. 

                When I was playing I realized
that I was investing too much on insurance and instead I decided to build up my
defenses early for the second time. This helped me protect my colony from many
comets and I had more resources to develop my colony. The balance between
protection and pods was the key for me to get to level 5. I only needed
insurance once through all 5 levels. I learned that there are two types of
risks: ones that you can avoid and ones that you can’t. However, even with the
risks that you can’t avoid, it is still possible to mitigate them in order to
reduce their effects. In addition, I also got to witness how insurance can be a
lifesaver in desperate situations. 

                I would add more investment
options on higher levels. This would help the game be more interesting and
prove how different options pay out at the end. Also, there should be a numeric
label beside the progress bar at the left hand side. It is too ambigious. This
would also help us understand how pods contribute to progress and see how
upgrading the pods help the progress bar. I also didn’t find an explanation
about whether the progress bar is still filled if the pod is being upgraded or
not. This might help strategically when you are running out of time and you
need the progress bar to fill up.
