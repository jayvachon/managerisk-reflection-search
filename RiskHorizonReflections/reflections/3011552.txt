Risk management was important from the
point of view of survival. Knowledge was important to have more time to repairs
after the damage was done after the impact of meteor. Insurance was important
to recover the costs of repairs after the impact. Having higher amount of
insurance reduced the cost of repairs significantly. As this was a game and
after playing a few times we could predict what would be the extent of damage
in each level, we could anticipate how much insurance would be most desirable. Too
high insurance in the initial levels was not necessary as the extent of damage
was not so much. Protection was important to protect from the waves arising
after the impact. Higher levels gave higher protection but we did not require
very high levels as the time and money spent in reaching very high levels was
not justified by the amount of protection it gave. Further, as the money saved from
every higher level of protection was not defined, it was not deterministic how
much resources should be spent on it. 

After playing the game a few times, I realized
that it is important to protect the current population effectively than to
create more pods. Also, the research was very important to gain maximum time to
recover damage after the impact. Insurance at the minimum level was sufficient
to cover the repairs cost.

If I was to develop the next version of the
game I would add a feature called ‘Backup’. This feature would allow me to
create a stock of materials and other items which I could build and store as
inventory during the repairs time. This would save my time of repairs after the
impact and also help me utilize my idle time. 

We know that risk of impact and thus the
damage is inevitable. We cannot eliminate the risk but we can try to reduce the
damage through various means like protection, insurance and research. The main objective
is to predict, mitigate and recover from the risk.
