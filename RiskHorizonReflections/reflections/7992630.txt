The role of risk management in this game, first you have to have a sufficient knowledge about the risk so you can built a protection to prepare for the risk and if you have more capability then you can transfer some of the risk with buying an insurance. Knowledge about the risk is the most important to know how big the shock will cause by the risk.For the first time of the game i did not realize about the knowledge important and the need to built more protection so i lost the game at the first level, And change the strategy with gain the knowledge, then tried to built more community and upgrading the protection level to facing the risk, and bought insurance to transfer some of the damage repaired. The more protection we can build the more resilience community to the shock. To change for the better, i would like to propose to build community protection for the preparation for facing the risk and gain knowledge about the risk we are facing. Insurance can help but the social community protection building are the first to respond and minimized the risk impact. The knowledge will help us to know the serenity and chances of the risk.With this game i learned 3 things: 1. For developing community, we must understand that risk is not something we can avoid, but we can build a protection to prepare for the risk and make our community more resilience to the risk impacts.2. We must have knowledge about the risk we are facing in our community, such us, weather, climate, environment and etc. the more knowledge we gain, the more we can estimate the risk shock and reduce the impact3. Insurance is not a protection, but it can help us minimizing the repaired cost from the impact of the risk, So in risk management the 3 important things is knowledge, protection and insurance.
