The
Risk Horizon Game shows how risk management can affect a community’s resilience
to shocks, from how it reacts right after the shock, to how it will cope.  Preparing for risk, and coping for the
subsequent effects, would need to balance investment in protection, insurance,
and/or research (knowledge), while keeping in mind the community’s limited
resources, not only in terms of finances, but also in time.

 

At first,
I focused on creating community connections (i.e., connecting the green lights)
as fast as I can, and I only invested in insurance and research.  But I only reached Level 2.  

 

Later
on, after initially trying around three times, I realized that merely
restarting without changing my tactics would not get me through to the next
level. I tried investing in insurance and protection at the beginning or onset
of Level 1. On the sixth or seventh trial, I noticed that the comet’s effects
were undermining my investment in protection and in trying to upgrade my pods.
It seemed that I was too focused on responding to the effects of the comet, and
if I am not fast enough to create community connections, I end up not being
able to reach the required financial resources to beat a level (particularly
Level 3). I noticed I was merely relying on luck or chance of the comet missing
or not hitting the community.

 

On
the eighth or ninth trial, I then changed my strategy to putting more
investment on protection even at the start of the game.  I also increased the number of pods and tried
to level up as quickly as possible (even while I was still on Levels 1 and 2),
and I invested in the highest insurance per level at the start of the
game.  

 

Also,
it seemed that while waiting for the comet to hit (while on research mode), it
was better to keep upgrading the pods and even the protection gauge. It turned
out that the research time did not need to reset, so I was able to act on the
information from the research, instead of just waiting for the gauge in the
research time to increase and not act on the additional information gained in
terms of severity and chance of impact, and not lose the research time I
already gained. 

 

Regretfully,
I only had limited time to play the game, so I only reached Level 4. I really
liked the game as it is, but if I will be able to add an aspect, it might be a
good idea to have bonus points at a certain level and criteria (e.g., 0% damage
for at least 2 comets), which could be converted to either finances, higher
level pod, or higher level protection. 
It could represent a grant from financing institutions or even a loan
given to developing countries.

 

I
learned from this game that focusing only on one aspect of risk management
would not be enough, to save finances. I believe it teaches us to become more
proactive in improving things and increasing our knowledge on risks, instead of
just relying on luck or always choosing the “status quo,” as it reaps more
benefits compared to its initial cost. Also, merely focusing on the “coping”
phase is more unpredictable and can undermine the initial investments done on
the community’s development.  There
should be a balance in mitigating the effects of risk and in responding/coping
to the effects after the shock does take place. The importance of time was also
emphasized, since it was always important to make decisions and to act quickly.
