Overall, I finally reached level 5 of the game and herewith, I am going to reflect my "gaming behaviour".Concerning question 1:As far as I figured out, the key point in reaching higher levels is always the development of your buildings. As you get more money if the buildings are more developed and you need more money in order to develop further and reach another level, I tried to save as much money as possible (vicious circle). That is why I put the main emphasis on saving money and thus, my preparations for risk affected my development immediately and positively. The most cost-efficient way of risk management in this game is "research" and because it gets easier if the research is highly developed (more accurate forecasts), I mostly put the emphasis on developing the buildings and on research. Only if my research suggested that I needed some protection, I lifted the protection to level 4-5. Even if there were some meteorites that suggested higher levels, I kept below the severity in order to save money and only in case I had some money at the end of a level, I raised the protection a bit. Furthermore, I only bought insurances on level 1 or (sometimes) level 2 (cost-saving). Combining these measurements it worked quite well but I definitely think, there might be some room of improvement.Concerning question 2:At first, I put the emphasis on protection and, also referring to the course content (protection helps on the long run), this did not work quite well. I spent to much money on protection and had no money on development and was thus not able to reach higher levels. When I changed my focus on saving money and developing further, it worked even better.Concerning question 3:I personally find this question really difficult because you definitely need some abstraction in order to simulate even complicated things in an easy way. However, as I already mentioned in my answer for question 2, I would probably also add a focus on the long run: The lecture content tells us that protection may be efficient on the long run. This is absolutely not represented in the game as you have to buy new insurance with every new level and you do not have any benefits by already having had some in older levels. Therefore I would add some "discount-system": You are always collecting certain percentages (depending on the insurance you had before) and thus getting some extra-discount on the new insurance.
