The game was quite challenging to me
because I immediately felt that the lack of information about  the
entire situation was fundamental. To begin with, in order to make any
kind of decisions , you should command very welll the ex-ante risk
management phase . Therefore, you need time to learn to distinguish
between actual risk ( the comets with the higher probability to
strike) and the ones they are not.  So, to me, knowledge is the key
factor, even if you need to spend a lot time researching the   useful
informations.  And , obviously, you acquire knowledege , above all,
from your mistakes and failures ( luckily, It's just a game!). 

I believe that obtaining the right
balance between knowledge, protection and insurance is a quite
difficult task because you have to get (multitasking) many decisions
in a short period of time . You definitely need a team composed by
experts in each area! 

The game helped me understand how is
complicated  for a government, private owner and especially the
single households to build  something that could improve their lives
without being overwhelmed by the fear of risk.
