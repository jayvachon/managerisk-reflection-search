Before getting to level 5, I lost many times, because in each new try, I was discovering why my strategy didn't work and why I lose during the last game.After playing for many times, I figure our that risk management is the key of the game, you should understand your risks, what you can lose and how to reduce the potentials damages.In the beginning I was only focused on building more and more, the attend the required level fast and than pass to the next level, and with strategy I couldn't even win the 1st level.So I changed my choices and I start considering the potential risks, so I was buying insurance( in the 1st level, the 50% was enough, since the cost of my buildings wasn't that high) and also try to secure more my land by putting it little bit in a higher level, than I could finally win some levels.In an other point, we should invest so much in preparations, because after all, you should grow as fast as possible and before the end of the 3 minutes. So knowing how to balance between investing in protection and you own development was very important to achieve each level successfully.As a conclusion YES, getting needed knowledge about the risks, understanding how you can protect yourself and reduce damages, and being aware of the importance of an insurance, those was the main point to get and to do.If I will play the game again, I will review my strategies before, and try to find the best balance between protection and development. Honestly, I do love this game and I enjoyed playing it, because I learned some important personal lessons, and see how even when we are not expecting risks, or let me say ignoring them (because this is what's happening in the majority of the countries), there is always a very small percentage that this risk can happen, so we should always be prepared.In my case, I'm living in Tunisia, and to be honest, it's not one of the most risky countries in the world, but after following this course for two weeks already and playing the game, I'm aware that there is always a risk, but just I don't know it. So for my next step, I will start with the 'knowledge' step, understanding our reality and what are the potential risks that we can face in my country.In the end, I find the game very rich but maybe if I should change something, I will make it more interactive and allow people to share their thoughts about it, their scores and make it a real way to teach players by awaking their awareness.
