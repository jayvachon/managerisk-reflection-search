1. In the game, the risk management shows how to manage risk to save lives or everything in earth from comets' disaster.In term of Knowledge, we know what we face (the danger), we can take more safety systems to get protected from (Protection), and for Insurance, when we know the nature of the risk, after applying Protection measure, we could know that we can avoid it, but we can decrease its effects on goods and human being.2. What I learnt from the game is that, we still hesitate about knowing very well the danger (comets) before getting protected and also we say, we should better get insurance once we know the dangers existence.So we can change every time these parameters (knowledge, protection, insurance) to minimize damages on the planet.3. If I should innovate the game, I would add more protections systems, or the choices between several protection methods, to represent the risk management that matter in the place I live.
