Risk management played an important role in the game. I prioritised the use of protection, which in hindsight is not the best way (I only knew that raising protection stops development after reading the FAQ, after playing the game). I used knowledge for borderline cases that may or may not result in damage to the pods. I used insurance as a last resort, which means if I am not confident of fully protecting the pods in time in the event of a hit, I would save up and buy insurance instead.As for how development was affected by preparing for risk, I now know that there’s a significant impact immediately on development as I prioritised protection, which would halt development.I played the game 3 times, and the first time I played I did not reason things through and just played by intuition. On the 2nd time I tried concentrating development on a few pods only and while that worked out very well at the start, it soon become too expensive to do anything, and development did not happen enough to pass the 3rd level. With the strategy mentioned at the start I then managed to get to level 5.What I learnt was that buying insurance that you likely won’t need would stump development (I was buying insurance almost every round in the first two tries).As the people here tend to be risk-averse, I would make protection slightly more expensive so that people cannot always be sure that they will get no damage from a hit. I might also slightly decrease effect of an impact to bring across the idea that it is not so bad to take a hit once in a while.
