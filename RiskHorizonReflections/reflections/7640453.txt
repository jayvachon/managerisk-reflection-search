The role of risk management was to create the greatest balance between
risk and opportunities to achieve development. I chose what it takes in each
situation in a logical way keeping a good balance among knowledge, protection,
insurance and community connections because all these tools were important for
development. Preparation was a key point an you can see its benefits immediately.
After playing several times, I realized how important was to balance the
resources (insurance, protection, research) and how important was to take into
account the limited budget and time I had to achieve my aim. Regarding a change
I would add to the game, for sure I would add some key actors in the scenario,
for example, the State, the International Community, NGO's and so on. I would make
them participate as they do in real life (providing loans, humanitarian help,
proposing new ideas and resources for development, etcetera).Â
