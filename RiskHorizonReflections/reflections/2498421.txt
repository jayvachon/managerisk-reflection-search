The role of risk management in the game was to predict the amount of risk and to take measures to facing it i tried to balance between growing community and preparing for potential shocks.I tried to rise the island to be fully protected against comets also i worked on research which collected by opened the telescope window on a particular comet, also i purchased the 75% insurance plan, which was a very useful tool to facing this risks and participated on reducing the affect of crises.in addition I used the preparation for risk to control the level of developmentI played the game more than once, from the second time I tried to reduce building and upgrade your pods and concentrate on research and to raise protectionIt's a very useful game but i think in case i'm in charge of developing a new version of this game I will make it by score which increase by using the game option, which will make it easier to play, also i will make more choices of research and protection and insurance
