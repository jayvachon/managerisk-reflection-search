I could resort to insurance, protection and
research in order to ensure subsistence, resilience and fast recovery of the
community. Research developed the community quickly, but protection brought me
the true safeguards during the game and enabled continuation of the process
through and through. Insurance was the first thing that I done at the beginning
of every single stage of development and operation, but it did not come with as
many benefits as it was the case with constant and increasing protection of the
community. Research brought me many resources necessary.

The thing that I have changed was the
prioritizing of protection as a resilience factor. I really want to stress that
one. It really was a game-changer. As the attempts were closing, I began
building more pods, patiently and slowly and intended to develop them equitably
and proportionately. I am not sure how much did that aspect contribute to the
overall success. I decreased over time investing in insurance and instead began
thinking about protection. After protection, research was held as a key to
progress, whereas the insurance was the thing that I purchased always and at
the very beginning of the stage, but I did so over time at a decreasing rate.
Finally, I held insurance at the minimal level, while I kept my hopes high on
protection. I tried to keep the protection category constantly and consistently
at the highest level possible. So, when the comets were hitting and crashing at
the community, the damage was decreasing. When the stages went on, I have
noticed that I was finally left with little to no damages at all. That is why
insurance began receiving less and less significance as a factor. It was almost
completely substituted with protection, because, obviously, the damages were
barely there. I think even, that during the last chances of playing the game, I
had an accident or two with the comets and the community has established
resilience that allowed it to absorb every situation and consequences at hand.

Also, I have been developing and upgrading
the pods equally and diligently. It was, in a way, my primary duty, because
without that, the whole point of it would be gone.

I sincerely don’t know what I would add to the
game. I liked the game very much but I believe as well that this time might
have been replaced with some additional readings or interesting and enriching
interviews by experts in the field and examples. Thank you for the experience
anyway!
