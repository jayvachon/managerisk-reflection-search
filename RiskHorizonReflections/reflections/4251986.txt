I did not understand how to increase the Research points in the game - which in real life is essential in order to prepare for risks. I tried to develop the society as soon as possible, because higher development rate reduces the damages caused by meteors when they hit. I also always aimed for the highest possible level of insurance in order to save costs of damages if they occur. Preparation for risks slows down development, but on the other hand if the meteor hits the community and damages happen, they slow down as well. The main things I learned from the game are: important to invest in development of the society, however not on the cost of risk-preparedness. Insurance in the game plays a big role, which I'm not sure is the case in real life. I played the game four times, on the fourth time I tried to invest in fewer number of settlements but instead develop them as fast as possible. I also learned that if the level of preparedness is too high in comparison to the level of risk of the meteors, the investment is wasted. If I would develop a new version of the game, I would put more attention to the research-component, and also invent different kinds of risks (not only meteors) in order to raise awareness of variety of possible risks hitting communities. In the current version the income is created quite easily - this should be more challenging.
