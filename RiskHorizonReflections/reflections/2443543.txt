1. Risk management reduced the impact of hits if they occurred and impacted the speed of recovery after hits. It also impacted, however, prosperity in times before hits. Risk management had the opportunity to improve prosperity if the right balance was found, and to hinder prosperity if it resulted in a lack of resources, either because of inadequate mitigation of impact hits or because it deterred efforts away from development. 2. After playing the game the first time I became more mindful of the balance betweenÂ  risk management and prosperity. I also changed my settlement strategy, focusing more on developing a smaller number of settlements with connections between them. As my development grew I increased the resources devoted to risk management, and I began to perform more research on the comets as they approached to be able to assess the risk of a direct hit more rigorously. I decided not to prepare much for risks with low impact and low probability of occurrence, and prioritized risk management when facing risks with high impact/high probability. 3. Add different types of risk - risk management depends on the types of risk faced as well as the probability and severity. Certain risks require different types of resilience than others. For instance adding a risk of infectious diseases that penalizes close contacts among settlement (as opposed to rewarding them in case of natural disasters presented here) would for instance require one to strike a balanced contact rate.
