The role of risk management in the game was about analyzing
the risks, preparing for the risks and coping with the shocks to the society in
a way that would optimize its growth.  I
found that immediate protection of my society through knowledge (research) and
community connections were the most effective way to support my society.  I played the game numerous times.  The first time I played I got to level five
and found that I was not quite able to meet my development goals.  I expected to be able to increase development
and reach level six easily.  However, I
found it difficult to both boost development and protect my society.  I was unable to make it to level six. 

I learned that there is a very fine balance between
development and risk management and that a multifaceted approach is the only
way to protect a society long term.  I
had expected that the highest insurance would be the best solution, but I only
tried that for one level before I realized that it didn't work.  A balance between insurance, knowledge/research
and community bonds were the most effective means of protection.

If I were to develop an adaptation to this game I would
introduce an idiosyncratic risk that impacted one home in the society so that it temporarily could not be repaired and it would not provide money to the
community.
