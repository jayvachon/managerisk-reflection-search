I realized while playing the game that a number of trade offs were necessary for effective risk management, because of the limited resources i have access to i relied heavily on information of severity of the comets to determine the level of protection and insurance needed at every point in time, if i spent to much on protection, insurance and building the actual pods would suffer, the level of severity of the shocks determined the level of protection i deployed, i also realized that building up the pods which represents infrastructure in my part of the world is a gradual process and i managed to build them up and fortify them over the course of the four levels of the game to a formidable stage like the Chilean examples highlighted in the Video lectures, the knowledge of the severity of the shocks gave me an advantage to measure the amount of protection needed which eventually resulted in my spending less on insurance due to adequate protection, the extra funds saved from reducing insurance went to building more pods and fortifying the existing ones.I played the game twice and i failed miserably the very first time i played it because i spent on the available resources on protection which turned out to be too excessive for the level of shocks that actually occurred, when I played it a second time i paid more attention to the trade offs necessary between protection, insurance and coping with the aftermath of these shocks, the knowledge i had of the severity of the shocks was very key to my decision making in allocating my scarce resources to achieve effective risk management when the shock eventually did happen, also as i progressed through the level i was able to spend less on insurance because i had mad adequate provision for protection and the shocks weren't resulting to any damage thus i could spend more on building more pods and fortifying the already built pods.If i had the chance to add one thing to the game that would aid better risk management to the game it would be to add an incentive for decision makers to put in place risk management policies, i say this because in Sub saharan Africa where i live the decision makers are far removed from the populace who will be beneficiaries of this policies and who would suffer from the effects and devastation of the lack of risk management policies, as you may have noticed large parts of Africa are the least prepared areas in terms of risk management and disaster recovery, this stems from a few factors mainly lack of resources, Ignorance and to a larger extent lack of incentive of major decision makers (Government, Private sector) to implement these policies.
