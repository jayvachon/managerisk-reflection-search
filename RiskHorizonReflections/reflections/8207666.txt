The game was so much interesting and was designed in such a way that it allows the participants to cope up with the disasters with insurance facilities.. i was seriously playing thinking something serious had really happened because i am just new to all these kinds of disasters and i considered it so much beneficial for unlike the normal quizzes which also test our understanding in the subject but in a bit different way .. this was an awesome game with resources and allowing us to take our own decisions which is practically not possible for a seventeen year old girl like me in real life . i wish to have many creative and informative games like this to enrich our knowledge on this topic .this was quite an interactive game where a comet came unexpectedly and damaged my protections for the comet where the insurance compensation was insufficient to cope up with the disaster. i thank the faculties who have given me a wonderful opportunity to play this game
