Game ReflectionRisk management played a central role to the
game. Without proper risk management, the player would be unable to create a
thriving community and reach Alora’s development goals. Proper risk management
not only prevented or mitigated damage from the comets/flooding, but also allowed for
continuous growth/development. The game is built on the aspects of risk management –
knowledge, protection, insurance – and following the shock, coping. In
the game, I had to make choices that balanced investment in knowledge/research,
protection, and insurance. For example, I would only develop half of the
possible protection in order to save enough time and money for development and
insurance. Because I purchased insurance (usually at 75% coverage), I could
afford not to devote as much time to research and protection, instead investing
my focus on increasing development through construction. Preparation for risk
immediately reduced the cost and time of reconstruction. Over time, preparation for risk allowed
for my community to grow and to proceed to the next levels because I did not
have to spend as much time waiting to earn enough money to fix my buildings
(thus stalling development). Balancing insurance and protection also saved me
time – I did not have to build protection to the level where it would take time and money away from development.I played the game multiple times. At first, I
placed too much emphasis on protection and avoided purchasing insurance. This
proved to be incredibly expensive and wasteful of time. Building protection stopped development and, on top of that, building protection took so much time that comets/flooding would hit the town and my buildings would still get damaged anyways. This was
expensive, and took even more time/money away from development because I had to spend
money to fix buildings. I changed my approach and balanced insurance with
protection; I kept an eye on research to have an idea of how hard the comets
would hit. I also budgeted my money more effectively so I could buy
comprehensive coverage (often at 75%). This boosted development and allowed me
to progress to the higher levels. The main things I learned from this game are
the importance of balancing knowledge, protection, and insurance. I made a
mistake by focusing solely on protection – this approach heavily inhibited
growth and development. I also learned that, as was mentioned in the lectures,
some risk is unavoidable and that is where coping plays a role (paying the
leftover deductible from insurance for the buildings’ reconstruction). It was more
efficient for me to take a small hit and have insurance cover most of the damage than
to try and build protection at the expense of development.If I were able to add one simple thing to the game,
I would add another development goal so that the player would have to balance
between knowledge, protection, insurance, budget/money, time, economic growth
and (for example) social goals (i.e. literacy rate or health indicators).
Another single change I would propose (based on the economic situation of my
country) is to somehow build into the game income inequality. Even in the same
country, disasters/shocks have different effects on different communities
because different areas in the same country have different median incomes. I
think it would be interesting to see how the player decides which communities
to invest in (areas with more income and more tax revenue versus areas with lower income and lower tax revenue), if he/she chooses to leave any behind, and how that would
affect the overall development rate.
