Risk Horizon is a very interesting game, when leveling up, the role of effective and efficient risk management was more and more clear for me, preparation, confronting risk , and coping with its effects was so clear to achieve the prosperity for this Alora community. For me at the early levels i was only using protection and knowledge , as i had this feeling that the cost of insurance are being wasted because the majority of the risks i was confronting only with protection and knowledge, without receiving any damage that insurance can cover, but later when the risks were so severity and number of risks were so high i had to include insurance in my combination in facing risk , especially when the the research was so limited for so many risks and the cost of developing protection network was getting higher the more we develop it.If i played the game more, for sure i would give more importance to the insurance as an element of successful risk management , because i learnt that the mechanism is always one but some times we have to focus more on one or two of the elements depending on the situation, i also learnt that never under estimate any risk and prepare for every thing even if the possibilities were so low to get affected by it,Also i think that the most important thing i learnt out of this game is that the resources we are affording to put up with good risk management are not losses at all , on the contrary they are real investment.Â in my opinion the game was well designed to reflect Risk and how can we manage it , i think it can be good if the game could give hints or alerts, to notify advice the manager that there is maybe a better way to manage the risk , like that the player will have full understanding to all the aspects of risk management , and what elements and when to use according to a specific situation.
