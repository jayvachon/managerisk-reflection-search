1) What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?- Balance growth with protection against damage is the key to the development of a community - Being prepared allows us to recover quickly from a tragedy so we can continue our growth2) If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game? Initially not invested much in preparation for a tragedy. For the second game I balanced growth with the preparation and when the comet hit, I had more seconds to connect with other shelters and reduce impact damage to zero. It was very important to consider research on comets, this allowed me to buy insurance and invest more in protection significantly reducing the impact on the damage3) The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?- Maybe the time  between levels, I think we need more time to take  a choise- Other opcion could be include people, because the people - especially politicians - will take decisión about how to resolve the problems when the comets hit
