For me, the
Risk Horizon Game is a good instrument to understand in a practical way,  the main concepts of Risk Management presented
in Chapter 1 and 2 of the World Development Report 2014, representing a
situation of systemic risk of being impacted by a comet shower.The role of
the risk management described is not only reducing the negative effects of the
risk, but increasing the positive effects, serving as a tool for development.The game presents  in a very simplified way the Risk Management Model,
conformed by  two phases: the Preparation
or “ex ante” phase and the Coping or “ex post” phase  and  three components: Knowledge (actions to
improve understanding of possible shocks and their potential outcomes);  Protection (actions to reduce the probability
or magnitude of losses from negative shocks, or to increase gains from positive
shocks); and Insurance (actions to transfer resources from good to bad times,
or to those most in need in bad times), showing the inverse interrelation
between the two phases and the necessity of having a good balance between the
three components to achieve a virtuous circle. It also demonstrates
that the decisions about Risk Management are based in a cost/benefit criteria,
depending on the relative prices of the different options available and the
size of the future shock and the probability of its occurrence.As well as, the game presents the matter of the obstacles for risk management, specifically, the financial constraint.Also, it demonstrates that mismanaged risks originate severe consequences and that proactive
risk management is the right way for managing risks.Finally, the
game shows that Risk Management is a continuous process of learning and
correcting, what I experienced by myself each time I played the game.The only change
I would propose to better represent the risk management choices in the actual world
would be to introduce obstacles to Risk Management strategies, conformed by
government failure (lack of public resources, coordination failure, among
others).
