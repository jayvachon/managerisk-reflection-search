Playing the game, we have three strategies to use and balance risk preparation and healthy development, namely; the power of research, protection and insurance. while playing the game the first time I trade-off insurance of $300, 5% and continued to obstruct the meteor by clicking on them to prevent them from hitting. Also protection cost were incurred to raise the Island by filling the protection bar and protect it from being hit, by diverting the meteor and reconstruct quickly after suffering damage from each hit. In my second win, comet meteor had severity impact of 6, chances of hit was 8, and research 3, For meteor 2; severity was 1, chance of hit 3, research 6, And for meteor 3 ; severity was 4, chance of hit 6 research 6. And for meteor 4; severity 1, chance of hit 3, research 6, damage was at the cost of $194, 9% and insurance paid was $64.The comment that followed said "Did you know even a little bit of protection goes a long way? Even if your pods are damaged, they 'il be damaged less if you are protected. this makes them easier to repair"Preparation creates resilience and prosperity as you are able to research each comet meteor before attack, protect the community by taking adequate insurance while development takes place.Â
