My reflection on this game is that it combines
elements of strategy and project management as the Illuminator seeks to
construct and develop a community of pods on Alora in an environment beset by
risk. We need to manage risks in order to avoid total destruction. Progress
through the game is similar to following the logical framework of a project –
the objectives are like the charter outlining what needs to be done from start
to finish. There is a fixed budget amount but unlike my real world projects
there are no cash flow projections or budgetary allocations. The budget is
applied on a contingency basis to cover mandatory expenses for construction of
the pods but then we face the challenge of allocating scare resources between
adequate insurance coverage commensurate with the risk and research necessary
to determine the likelihood and potential impact severity of the risk as
represented by the approaching meteors. 

Initially I experienced annoyance at losing at
level one until I got the hang of the game. Had this been a real life situation
the project would have come to a screeching halt. The negatives were that the
insurance cover did not indemnify against the damage caused by the meteors
despite payment of the maximum premium in most cases. On further reflection I
realised that the insurance was limited to a certain percentage and that I was
actually fortunate to provide sufficient insulation against full destruction.
With further progress I was able to better prepare against the chain of
systemic risk represented by the meteors. 

The “lessons learnt” or experience gained
improved my capacity to prepare in advance. The second time around I was able
to advance to level four as I responded more quickly to raise the protection
level after identifying the likelihood of and severity of a hit. Insurance
cover was provided in the event of severe damage but the pods withstood the
ravages of destruction with better protection. It was necessary to think very
quickly and respond to risk and then cope with the damage, rebuild and
continue. The impact of a meteor strike was however not always equal to that
indicated by the research and it therefore became apparent that we cannot always
depend on past experience or projected indicators to accurately inform negative
occurrences. We do need however to recognize the probability of such risk; undertake
appropriate mitigation strategy and implement measures to cope with their
aftermath.

If I were tasked with developing a new version
of the game I would incorporate the main risk encountered in the place where I
live – a suburban district in close proximity to agricultural / farm lands. The
common risk is flooding after heavy rainfall despite relatively good drainage
systems. The environment on Alora would be expanded to include farm pods and
agricultural fields with rivers and watercourse traversing the landscape. The cash
allocation would be increased. In addition to the meteors the game would
therefore have approaching clouds with varying degrees of rain intensity and
the players would need to identify the likelihood of impact and severity of
rainfall; probability of flooding and extent of possible damage and then
undertake the necessary mitigation – insurance coverage, protect residences,
clear drains and water courses, move farm animals to higher ground or protected
shelter areas.  They would then be tasked with restoration / rebuilding in
the event of loss before progressing to higher levels.
