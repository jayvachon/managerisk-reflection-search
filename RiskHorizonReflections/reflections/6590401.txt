The role of risk management is the balance of development
with impact of comets by correct mixture of knowledge, protection, and
insurance.

Increase knowledge by doing longer research made prediction (severity
and chance of hit) more correct. 
Moreover, it gives more time to do community connections if hit.

Protection by buying insurance is also averaging the
risk.  If we have enough money, we should
buy the highest maximum premium because it pays for damages and it is cheaper
than you upgrade later.  Don't forget to
buy insurance in every level of game.  It
is similar to you buy insurance every year in real life.

Raising villages to the level of severity of comet is a
key.  However, don't spend unnecessary
waste of money by raising villages because we need to save money for
rehabilitation.  Less money left for rehabilitation
fails to pass to another level.

Build or upgrade pods make protection better and
faster.  Although more pods mean more in
wealth pool, don’t try to build a lot of pods unnecessarily.  It is better to build more quality pods than
low grade cheap pods.  More pods mean
more repairs needed.  If pods are damaged,
repair them immediately to increase the amount of wealth and fill meter faster.

Repair and connect the community immediately, if hit, so
that there is synergy effect.

If I get a chance to modify the game, I will try to
integrate early response activities to rescue lives in the game.
