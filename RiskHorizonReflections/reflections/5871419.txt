In playing this game, I tried to be mindful of the risks that those shocks posed and also mindful of the quantity of pods that I have built.  I tried to equate the risks with my pods and then bought protection or insurance accordingly based  on the information that is available when you clicked on those shocks which would indicate the probability of a landfall, whether research would be important/helpful or not.  So given these information I tried to have protection or insurance in place.  At the same time, to maximize the resources I have to build/repair pods or pay for these protection and insurance, I was mindful of the incoming comets.  I felt that there was a trade off between building/repairing pods, accumulating resources to pay for these pods and managing risks.  You have to choose one at any given time.  I was not so sure if this is because I can only work with my right hand - an issue with dexterity or something else?  In reality,all these factors - knowledge, protection and insurance come into play concurrently, albeit at different levels. I do not play video games so it took several attempts before I reached level 3 in this game.  I tried more attempts to see if I can move higher but I did not so I stopped concerned that I maybe addicted.  I tried to see if there was a pattern when shocks would show up so I could predict  and formulate appropriate response but I did not see any or maybe I missed it completely.  I attempted to "time" the building or repair of the pods based on the proximity to landfall of those red comets or based on whether there was a high probability of destruction.  In risk management, you actually factor in historical information to be able to predict what would happen and when it would happen. All these scenario analyses use past information and patterns to come up with possible outcomes to be able to act accordingly or decide which solution to take.If I were to enhance this game, I think the decision on whether to click on the comet at any given time as opposed to building/repairing pods would be facilitated if there was an indication how much it is worth.  I had a hard time whether it is the right time to build pods or to click on the comets.  I realize it is not always the case that we can quantify the trade offs were are taking, however it is helpful to know how much it is worth to us i.e. cost-benefit analysis.
