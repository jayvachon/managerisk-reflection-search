1) The game was a good illustration of the challenges of developing rapidly while facing risk and constrained resources. The allocation of resources has a profound effect on the outcome, and optimally allocating time and money is impossible in the face of uncertainty. With limited information, it was necessary to insure against losses and take measured risks to make significant gains.Insurance and community connections were the main avenues of protection. My strategy was to achieve just enough development to complete each level, upgrading my buildings across the board rather than focusing on a few. To avoid spending money on costly repairs of well-developed buildings, I used leftover cash to spend on protection - insurance and land raising.Comets were analysed based on risk of impact and severity of impact. The two are multiplicative and I would consider those with the highest combined risk*severity value to be most worth researching. On the smallest values, I avoided wasting money on looking. High risk comets were insured against and high severity comets were researched. Insurance was most efficient per unit spent at 75% and 33%. I avoided 50% because it gave less value for money. I started with 33% and moved to 75% because, once I reached level 2, increasing building repair costs meant this was a sensible investment.2)  In the first game I focused on building a few buildings and upgrading them as much as possible. Unfortunately this proved to be suboptimal because the repair costs were so high. Playing the game again, I changed approach, building on all 9 spaces and upgrading them equally. This yielded better, and less risky development. I became better at choosing where to focus my time and money in order to achieve best value for money (or time), taking into account efficiency of purchases.Another thing I learnt is the need to keep busy and micro-manage to achieve the optimal efficiency of development. It is also sometimes beneficial to wait for more information before investing - e.g. wait for my savings to increase to a level where I could upgrade a building, whilst researching a comet. Depending on the outcome of the research, I could then choose to upgrade (and face more costly repairs) or not.It isn't possible to do everything with the finite resources given. so I decided to only buy insurance when concerned about a comet with a severity of 6 or more. This is because my community connections with maximum research provided this much protection. This is preferable to buying it at the start of each level and allowed me to develop more rapidly if I didn't buy insurance. This was a good illustration of how risk-assessments and corresponding action can lead to big rewards with a small downside.3) Overall I thought the game was very good and represented the challenging trade-offs and necessity of risk-taking to development. I think another interesting take on the game would be to make the risk seem more relatable (comet-storms are thankfully very rare). For example consider a Cambodian village who rely on the monsoon for their rice fields but also live on a flood plain. As global warming develops, El Nino and El Nina, the South-American weather patterns are beginning to fluctuate, making more extreme weather more common. Risks, both of drought (no crops) and extreme rain (flash-floods threatening to wipe away the village) would give an interesting mechanic - different outcomes of the same thing represent different risks and should both be accounted for. Specialised crops and flood defences could be bought, but perhaps not both.
