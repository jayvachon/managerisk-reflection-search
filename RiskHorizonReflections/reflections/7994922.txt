In the game I assume the role of Managing Director of Risk Management having two fronts: Financial Management and Infrastructure Management, taking into account factors such as Investigations, Insurance and Protection. From the beginning I considered appropriate to pay the insurance premium that covers up to 75% while the spherical parallel modules installed. But I noticed that as trying to protect, bringing the field investigations were red; On the contrary, as he let the investigations grew monetary income increased, but neglected to pay attention to protection. I've played several times and I've learned was: 1. The importance of detailed knowledge levels and their potential risks. 2. Resources should be managed optimally to minimize the damage caused by falling meteors. 3. The above two points help to better design a comprehensive plan for risk management and decision making. What I would suggest adding a new version of the game would incorporate VISION. Just as there is information of each threat, you should also have information display last level or the development of each module to its highest level infrastructure. As in any design of a strategic plan, when part of a vision, we can better define the objectives, strategies, tactics and activities to be performed; what may be an incentive to drive better decisions.
