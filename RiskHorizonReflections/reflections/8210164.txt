the game help me to understand first about time. you will not know when the event will take place. it can be seen from a far by warnings. therefore we should be prepared for it at any time. this will help us to overcome the shock of the event. preparations like building things that will reducer the severity of the the risk.it helps me to understand the power of insurance. it will make it possible to cover some part of the losses that i may incur when the event strikes. to change something? i will try to use human animations and real animations for people to really understand their relationship with risk and not just building something that cant be felt.
