After spending several hours on the game I've found a couple of things.First and foremost is that we can't really be 100% prepared for what's to come - we have to manage resources and venues to make the best we can with them, given our knowledge of the subject.Time and resources are very important and the events unfold, regardless whether we are ready for them or not.Preparation for risk affected development - it stagnated the development process and also funds had to be used (which also affected development, as we could have used them for upgrades or insurance).The point of the game was to see how well players can manage time, resources and risk.The comets were random, so a player couldn't just learn a pattern.What we needed to do is to get to a certain point of development under certain amount of time - while life is happening around us.Players needed to decide whether they wanted to gamble their future on the chance the comet has to hit them and/or hope to neutralize the damage, or to pay a hefty sum and have an insurance for the round.While there is preparation element and one keeps their set up from round to round - the game wants us to think on our feet because they introduce random comets every round.I've learned from the game is that we can't always be prepared for everything and that we have to do the best with what we have. Preparation and research is always important because it's not something to be done when the crisis is upon us.It is important to have a good grasp and a balance between everything - we can't expect to "wall ourselves up" and think that we are ready for everything, nor we can afford to just invest everything into our economy, thinking that we can just throw money at any problem that may arise in the future.I've also learned that action before hand and action after a crisis strikes are both very important.I live in a country where one of the main banks kinda defaulted (well, it was kinda robbed by the director board lol) so in terms how I would have changed the game - I would have added internal economic threats and change the theme of the game to be more understandable (let's say it's a village/city on the beach, the pods can be quarters in the village and then city and instead of comets - different kinds of waves). So it would basically be like population happiness meter which will give bonus to the progress bar and money generation. It will depend on how well the player is prepared - a crisis strikes but no damage, people are happy, below 30% no change, over 30% damage and people are restless - can we fix everything up in 30 seconds? if so it's a boost the happiness meter.The bonuses wouldn't be huge, but they will be a good addition - should the game require a new feature.
