This game, in my opinion tested the very essence of risk management. It tested us to balance development and protection. In a sense it tested our risk management skills. Initially what I did was to make a lot of buildings and not focus on upgrading them. Then as the comets started making the life worse I chose to do more research and let the funds grow. Then I started upgrading the buildings so as to improve faster. Though insurances were more of a pain in neck initially, they proved to be of great help to me as the game progressed. Thus even though the preventive aspects of risk management were more of hurdle to development earlier they were the base on which development could be done more efficiently latter.     Frankly speaking when I played the game first I could not figure out any strategy to improve the score. But after the first game I realised it would be of more benefit to do research a bit more instead of reckless development. Somehow the game is a bit of an example that everyone should learn. 'It is of great importance that we learn how to manage risks'. After the first game the main thing I did was to do more of research earlier than latter. It was then that I realised the old sayings 'Prevention is better than cure'. This helped greatly as it became a lot easier to repair buildings and also helped to take some risks specially when the chances of comet to cause destructions were low.   If I were to develop on this amazing game the one thing that I would have loved to do was replace the effect of comets by the prospect of stock market. Now this becomes a game which will represent the opportunity side of risks a bit well. May be to make game a lot more appealing as well as easier to play what we could have done is instead of individual companies in a stock market we could have considered sectors as a whole (example: infrastructure, IT , Banking, etc.) and may be a five different countries so as we could also take some of the global effects into consideration. Like floods in a region may destroy a lot of crops and have an adverse effect on agricultural stocks of that index. Now suppose the country was the biggest supplier of say wheat, now the wheat prices would take an upshot.
