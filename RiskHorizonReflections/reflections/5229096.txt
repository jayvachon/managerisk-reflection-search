How much one can invest into development, protection and insurance? How to obtain sufficient cash flow to achieve the development objective and sufficient level of protection? One just trades off investments against protection and insurance. The knowledge focus is divided between most harmful events at the horizon, disregarding low impact (severity times chance to hit) ones. … then one should cope … The game made itself clear: there is no development without sufficient protection. As more developed you became, so the time and cost of recovery will also grew up. One can buy insurance reducing costs for recovery, but insurance doesn’t cover the time spent for the recovery. … so failing in achieving the development objective was imminent.For me personally the role of insurance gained new meaning in the context of the development. Considering its limitations trading off insurance against investments of protection is not always helpful and reasonable.The role of risk management in the game supposed to be support player to achieve the development objective set by the game. The development objective, which can’t be traded off, is demanding. In everyday life, we continue wherever we ended – it can’t be otherwise. Current game session is quite short and doesn’t allow adjusting the strategies on the fly. After two consequent (random) hard hits it’s over. Allowing it to play for the development score, which takes into account casualties, sum of damage, level of development achieved and time allows player to adjust its strategies – we all deserve a second chance.P.S I’m slow with mouse, so the clicking was quite painful.
