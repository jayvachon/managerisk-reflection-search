1 The role is to attend the necessity to cover the
buildings and the capacity of cash to contract. How you can improve your
reserve, get the best insurance and upgrade the buildings.



I done more than one try. The last I understand
that I have to create more buildings with different level of resources. The
insurance was a problem because just in the first level that I got the best
one.
