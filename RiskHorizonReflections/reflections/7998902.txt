The choices I made in this game was relatively and for example to explain that when I have low money and there is a comet approaching I should check what I have if I have low buildings not upgraded and the comet have a high chance to impact I would prefer to raise the insurance because there is a big risk that comet impact my town and there is no time to upgrade or take any other action.The preparation for risk needs to be before the risk occurs and it affects development is immediately.If I played this game again I would try to make balance between the factors unless there is a highly chance comet impact or even not a one comet for example in this case I would raise the knowledge and upgrade the buildings in lower rates comparing that to the normal conditions, and purchase a suitable insurance 50% or 75% in higher levels the insurance cost is higher so some times I maybe will have no other choice by choose low insurance value.Well, I learned a lot of things and here is it in points:1-first find out the percentage of the risks to happen then priorities it and act depending on it.2-deal with the high chance risks first3-insurance is important for better recovery4-gaining knowledge is the key to find the way to solve this problems5-knowledge needs the intention to work on the real ground, without this intention to deal with the predicted risks what would be the worth of knowledge?If I creating a new version of this game I would add the citizens population and the temporary immigration to other area feature in order to prevent any damage chance from this risks for the population, with adding extra things of course the immigration doesn't happen immediately but after some levels, add different buses for different costs or any other transport method to transport people to the other area, add the weather difficulties, add the temporary shelters value.In the place I live I think there is a main factor is missing developing and working on solutions, there is many events happens made a lot of people forget about the risk or just under estimate it.
