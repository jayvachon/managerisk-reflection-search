In the game, the role of risk management was to properly identify risks (comets), protect the assets (raise the altitude) and develop a prosperous society (accumulation of wealth to pass levels). Developing the assets as quickly as possible allowed the player to accumulate wealth at a much faster pace. By properly identifying the risks as soon as possible, the player was able to determine immediately if more research was to be performed or if the altitude needed to be raised accordingly. If done properly, the game could be completed without buying insurance once. Once a risk was identified, however, and if an appropriate amount of of research was performed, even the most severe comets could be mitigated with no damage. This would allow the player to continue developing his society with no setbacks. Additionally, if risks were properly mitigated, and insurance was not purchased, this allowed the player to continue allocating a greater share of his resources to develop the society.By playing the game a few times, I was able to quickly determine which comets needed more research. I learned that identifying and researching risks before they become an issue, I could forgo insurance. This allowed me to proactively develop the society, rather than react to damage caused by the comets. Additionally, once I had achieved the required level of development for each level, I would spend the remaining time and money -- comets permitting -- on raising the altitude of my city. This allowed me to start each level at a generous amount of money (accumulation outpaced protection level increments) and at a much higher level of protection, affording me the ability to spend time researching risks and developing my society as soon as I had enough money for each upgrade. I ran pretty thin levels of wealth in order to beat the game, but did so without insurance because I spent most of my time mitigating risks.If I were tasked with changing the game, I would allow the player the option of various levels of research and protection (altitude) instead of various levels of insurance. Because the game may be beat without insurance -- and because most insurance is full coverage -- I would like to give the player the ability to research comets at a quicker pace, but obviously at a higher cost, as well as the ability to increase protection at a quicker pace. In my opinion, this would be more realistic because with certain levels of wealth you can afford to throw more resources (people) at a problem. This is done so because higher levels of wealth allow for a better educated society, thereby affording the society the ability of tackling much larger, more complex issues.
