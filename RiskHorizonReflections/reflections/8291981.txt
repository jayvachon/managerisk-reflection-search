The
role of risk management in the game there is in to items 1st we should prevent
our community from shocks, and develop it also regarding to right meter. 2nd
item if we will suffering the shock we must preparation for it and balance
between preparations of shocks and growing of our community.

when we will confront the
risk we must have more effected knowledge (only useful) about what is the type
of the shocks and make enough researches about this chocks, to we can prepare the
good protections that we will use it to against the shocks, and also the types
of the insurance that i will provide my community in the better time to we can
reduce the impact of shocks.
when we face the risk, this risk will effect on our community and when we need
to development this affects immediately or after some times based on the first
shock will following by second nearly, if it will be follow so the late of
development its better but if the affect risk on our protection so we must
development immediately.
the different between the first once play and second time is what the types of comets
what level of affect and chance of hit what is the
level of insurance can be paid, I do more different things after the
fist, like change the protection strategy, and also change plan of devolvement,
and use button for change level of ground.
The main things that learned from the game in when we face the negative
shock we must make enough search to we can prevent the shocks by preparation strong
protection and provide the community by valid insurance.
If I imagine issue the new version from the game by change of the growing items
by true things like trees or plants and building to we can show true affect
the impact of chocks, and also I can add option like play the game on
the network with another gent.
