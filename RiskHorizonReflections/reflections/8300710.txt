Reflection on the Risk Horizon game.The game clearly shows how development is threaten by different kinds of situations, that if not properly prevented would endanger the quality of life of any human group. Risk is constant and it must be managed to preserve the achievements reached. Using the proper combination of tools is how risk is better managed. Non of these instruments is good enough by itself to hamper risk, specially considering that every risk management action took, distracts valuable resources slowing down the development process.In the first game, having insurance and investing in protection seemed like a good idea, but as it advances it´s more evident that resources won´t be enough to sustain such strategy, considering that neither insurance or protection can prevent risk absolutely and there will be inevitable loses and damages that will claim more resources and slowing development down.Despite the necessity  of insurance and protection, the most effective tool to manage risk is a combination of research and nets between the inhabitants of the game. Both elements allow to prevent risk and avoid damage most of the times and cost a lot less resources than protection and insurance. Knowledge produced by research provides with time to attend the risk properly and reduce damage.There is a direct relation between risk management and development. The accumulation of wealth allows the investment in preventive measures, and these preserve the process of gathering resources. If there is not enough investment in risk management in order to place all available resources to accelerate growth, the consequences of any risk event would be catastrophic and the aftermath negative. When it comes to decide how much resources put up to keep growing and how many resources should be invested in risk management the challenge is to achieve balance.Another important lesson to learn from the game is to take advantage of the good times, as if you reached the limit to go on to the next level and still have time left, it´s the best moment to invest in protection, that also requires time to develop. Well invested resources in protection would prevent a larger need of, on repairs or insurance.Finally, the simplicity of the game it’s a core virtue, but I would add another kind of risk that may combine with meteor hits to make things more interesting and complex, such as a disease or an economic down turn that slows the capacity of the population to build and repair, as it happens in life.
