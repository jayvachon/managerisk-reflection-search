The
role of risk management in the game is to allow the development of a community exposed to risks of different
magnitudes, caused by natural disasters, through proper balancing between the allocation of economic resources available to the community building, protection of all already built or
to the insurance to reconstruct
what was damaged in cases where the goods are not protected enough. 
The necessary choices during the game consisted of what to do first (build or protect), how much to build (depending on available resources and specific threats of natural
disasters) and how much time to
devote to research on the threats
coming, for knowledge allowing on the one hand to reduce investment in protection
and, on the other hand, self-protection by communities. 
The time spent on research is critical because its excessive use can result in
not being on time with acquayring the necessary insurance. Moreover, excessive investment in insurance and protection
can reduce possibilities of
community development at the right time,
making it impossible to meet the deadlines set for the development of communities. 
The game clearly shows
that if there is no preparation
for dealing with risk,  by  protection or insurance, either
immediately or after some time the
development is affected due to
the destruction of that built
or the lack of resources
to build in time adequately. 
To understand the mechanism of the game I had to play several times and by successive
attempts learned me that the best strategy  for  the first level was to build with the available
money, then perform appropriated  protections suited to the magnitude of investigated  threats (comets)
and then contract a some insurance of
medium value. With this strategy I
improved quite the performance of the following levels,
including the level four. 
Finally, if I could introduce new elements into the game I
would prefer to include  “the amount of money needed to invest in research and
development to reach each milestone in every different
game level”, as information provided while playing game .
