The major role of risk management was to develop Alora in a
healthy way whilst facing and preparing for the risk of comets.  I basically chose to develop aloha slowly
whilst taking more time to study the chances of comets hitting and their
severity. 

When the severity was low, focused more on developing Aloha
and once it became evident that the comets were to hit and the severity was
high, I opted for protection and insuring. 


My major focus was Knowledge, having the very accurate
information so as to guide my decision in whether to go for development,
protection and insurance.  

Preparation really made development not advance so fast but
it paid off when a risk occurred. 

If I played it again, I would focus more on research and
having more information as it is vital in knowing which decision to take.  This would help me spend money on insurance and
protection in a more rational way other than spending money that would
otherwise be used for development.  When
you do more research, you get concrete information and usually with enough time
to implement protection mechanisms.
