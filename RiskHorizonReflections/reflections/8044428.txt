1.- The role of risk management was to assess the risks related to meteor impact and lay out a strategy that would allow to keep the development of the community at a certain pace. After the assessment, in parallel to the development, the player has to take some actions to limit the effect of the risk (impact, reduced by insurance which would cover the losses but would delay development, limited by the prevention would would avoid partially or totally the damages but would reduce the resources for growth or reducing the effect by investing time in knowledge but which effect is limited) and being ready with enough resources to cope with the aftermaths of the shock produced by materialization of the risk (meteor impact).The strategy I implemented tried to minimize the impact in development (only way to keep up the speed required to finish the game) therefore was an immediate effect of slowing down slightly the development speed (negative immediate effect) but on the long run keeping an steady pace reducing the coping effect to almost 0 (positive delayed effect).2.- I played the game several time to learn the rules and sensitivities of all factors and the rules (the tutorial was not working). At the start the strategy was focused to reduce the coping effect (investing in insurance) but since the frequency of shocks was high this disrupted the development since the resources investment grew higher and higher and the time required for reparations was also avoiding to upgrade the facilities. After I realized that was possible to protect the village investing in resources which allowed to avoid time investment on reparations but also limited the access to resources since the required investment to avoid any consequences. Then I limited the investment into protection which allowed me to arrive to the last level of the game but the rare shock with great impact obliged to invest too much time in reparations.Finally I learnt about the knowledge which allowed to protect the village for the extra protection couldn't be invested due to development speed issues. At that stage the time invested in investigation did not delay the growth and allowed to reduce the coping to almost 0 in resources and time. That combined with a development strategy that reduced the initial pressure in the resources allowed to achieve the goal of completing the game.As a summary what I learnt was to apply a strategy that allowed to manage the risk and implementing measures that allowed to complete the game. This strategy was composed of different factors and dimensions that had to be taken into account simultaneously, and that was adapted to the particular case of this environment.3.- The simplicity of the game captures almost all the principals of risk management except one which is risk elimination (4 main strategies are: eliminate the risk, transfer the risk, reduce the risk or accept it which includes to be ready to cope with it). I would add the possibility to eliminate the risk in exchange of a considerable amount of wealth. Also would be necessary to change the sensitivities of the different parameters to adapt it to my environment.
