Risk management helps to avoid damage or at least reduce it, so recover and reparing are fast and cost will be less important. Sometimes by combining the knowledge and protection, insurance was not necessary. other times i had to take insurance even if knowledge and protection were high especially when the time between comet's falling is short.Risk preparedness can slow development, since all resources are directed towards the preparation. But once it's done, developing can continu. If i play it again, I'll learn from mistakes especially on the part of research and i will invest in it. And if I have to replay it several times after the first time i will try to accelerate development and build and develope more pods.The main thing i learned from the game is that the better way to confront risk is to combine different materiels (knowledge, research, protection , insurance).Â If i have to add one more think in the game, i would add a delay for everything: a time for research, a period to take insurance... if it's not so its too late. This is a big problem in my country, we take too much time to take a decesion so it often too late when we decide to act.
