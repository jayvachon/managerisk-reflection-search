     This game was so much  fun and also challenging. it was very helpful to get knowledge on risk management chain. A game is look like simple but it wasn't. participants should have clear understand about how to get information about risk, and how to prepare for the risk and how to mitigate damages. the knowledge that I gain from this course was very helpful to successfully complete the game.1. this game have considered on how to prepare for the natural disaster. Natural disasters are the main risk that whole world is faced recently in different conditions.most important thing of risk management is a knowledge about the risk.  I am highly considered about research on the combat. It was useful to get to know about possibility of hitting and also impact. According to game it was also made enough time to prepare for the waves and inform community about that. According to the result of the researches I increased the protection level.On the other hand it was not that much of cost.  So I gave priority to protection level. In the level one I reached to 4 degree of the protection level and after that I increased protection level based on the information that get from the researches.When it comes to insurances, in the first stage I got a Medium level insurance coverage but up to 2nd level I got full insurance coverage. It was worth because when community got damage two times it was very effective to recover damage by very  low cost. And also when the community get damage from the waves I gave priority to recover the damages rather than developing polls further.2. I play this game few times. Level 03 was more challenging and really it was a hurdle. Sometimes I got confused because even though I got enough protection level and insurance coverage, I lost. Then I realised I have to more focus on researches and it gave more time to prepare for the risk. And other Key thing was keep developing the community of the Alora. Firstly I tried to build as much as amount of buildings and got it those to next level.But then I realised building few and develop them further was much effective. Then I expanded community further while developing. Somehow keep developing community was critical. 3. I prefer if the game was related to risk that something familiar to us such as flood,landslide etc. We have experienced tsunami before but  it was caused of earthquake.This game can developed further by using multiple risks. As a example after hitting combat it can lead to earthquake and diseases can spread after waves. It would be helpful to enhance over knowledge on multiple risks. And also community development can also enhance further. Building schools,hospitals,canals  or other facilities based on requirement will be much more effective rather than just develop buildings.
