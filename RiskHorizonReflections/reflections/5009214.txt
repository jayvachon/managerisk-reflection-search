I find the game quite interesting and informative at the same time. The risk in the game is portrayed through the meteors that may hit your development. The player has to manage the risk of the severity, likelihood and the timing of the damage happening. All this of course while staying on a tight budget as well as a steep goal to reach in terms of the development to successfully complete the level. 
The player has to make choices as to what to prioritize: Knowledge of the meteors, Insurance, Safety, Opportunity of developing the establishments. Of course there had to be trade-offs for being able to finish the levels, and I played the game multiple times to find out the best approach to complete the task.

Initially I thought before the meteors hit me, I would build as many pods as possible and in their basic state without upgrades, My next priority was to keep an eye on the meteors severity and likelihood but not accumulate the knowledge but to focus on improving my safety by holding the protection bar. I also purchased the most comprehensive insurance available.

I quickly found out this wasn't the best method to avert the danger and at the same time develop my habitat successfully.
Next I tried out building a solitary pod, buy the same insurance as before, but this time raise my protection to 1 bar  only and then get the knowledge about meteor to 2 bars. Then upgrade my pod as funds are becoming available. If meteor isn't likely to hit me (likelihood is not higher than 3 bars). Then I would rather improve my protection than get more knowledge about the risk.

This method didn't work out as well as I would have thought, finally I decided to limit my pods to 3, get 50% insurance coverage, and balance my time and money between developing the 3 pods and improving my protection to 2 bars, and then get as much knowledge as possible for the more severe meteors. The preparation for risk initially didn't affect my pods development much as I focused more on development and less on the meteors. But my final methodology meant I had to slow down on development a little and focus on risk management to get my habitat to the highest level of development in the end (after the meteors hitting me and the time running out).

If I was tasked to change or add one thing, I would change the way the protection bar works, I would make it more practical / meaningful than having the player to just click and hold it or the way "make the connections" to improve safety works. 

Overall I think the game did in a simple, fun and an imaginative way ingrain the fundamentals of risk management in me. Kudos to the developers!
