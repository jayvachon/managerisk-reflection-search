Risk Horizon is a very well designed strategy game that
explains the importance of risk management for the healthy development in a
very simple way. I played the game two times. In the first run, I chose to
build all the Pods first and then upgrade them. Simultaneously, I attuned my
Protection level in-line with the maximum Severity of the meteor for the
respective levels. The chances of hit or probability of meteor causing damage,
also played a very crucial role. In round three, I faced one meteor with a very
high severity and chances of hit. Consequently I undertook an Insurance with
50% coverage which helped me a great deal in mitigating the damage. But I
lagged behind in researching and Knowledge front and hence reached only  till Level 3.

In the next run, I built 3-4 Pods and then upgraded them.
Connected community helped immensely resulting in minimal or no damage. I
observed  that when I was increasing my
protection level, my growth/game's progress came to a halt. Nevertheless, I
kept a very high level of protection which reduced the damages caused by highly
severe meteors with high chances of hit also to a very minimal level. Also I
noticed that once we incur damage, the progress bar also goes down, thus
mimicking the real life condition where our development is hampered
considerably by the risks. 

The major learning from the game are that if we stay united
and face the problem as a connected community, then the risk reduces considerably.
Insurance is also very crucial in coping with the risk by mitigating our
losses. I learnt that preparing for the risk by researching , thus increasing
our knowledge and protection level, might seem very costly before the risk. But
the benefits of Protection heavily outweighs the Cost of risk preparation.If I were to develop a newer version of the game, I would focus more on increasing the vitality of Knowledge and research in Risk Management in terms of effective preparation and coping mechanism for the risk.
