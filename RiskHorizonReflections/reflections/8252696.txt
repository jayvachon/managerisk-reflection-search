In this game, risk of being hit is the only danger threatening your gaining enough scores to win the game in limited time. So the capacity of risk management is crucial for players to win.Time management is crucial too. I always find there was not enough time to rise from the shock of hit. How to rank the priority and allot limited time to the three major tasks in order to reduce damage and gain more score, is decisive for success. But limited time often makes this three measures seeming conflictive to each other. They all need time, especially constructing the pods, raising the ground and researching. So you have to find a better strategy to arrange these three tasks.I played this game several times. In the beginning, I spent most time build pods to gain money and bought the most expensive insurance to reduce loss. The result of this strategy was that I invested too little time on researching, so the damage was so great that I had no enough time to regain sufficient scores to succeed. Then I made some adjust in time allotment. But this time, I spent too much time on researching, then I found the construction was too slow to gain the scores needed, too. So in the later rounds I constructed a pod first to gain start money, then I bought a low rate insurance to cover the possible loss. After that, I watched for falling stars to see how much time I need to research. If the chance of being hit is high, then before  investing much time to research, I started to construct several pods, so they could be built while researching. If the chance of being hit is low, I would continue to construct. And I found that if your preparation is enough, high rate insurance would be not worth it. And I found that use some time to raise the ground was worth your time. Raise the ground in precaution and research for enough long time, you wouldn't need spend much money on insurance, and you also save the time for reconstruction. Although I only make to level two, I still learnt a lot from this game. It forced you to choose something and give up something at the same time, and it made  me to discern the different natures of the three tactics of risk management. It's a wonderful and inspiring game. But if I could make a small amendment, I will make the research process a add up process rather than a always from zero one. Because in real life, if you keep on researching something, your knowledge and skill will increase, too. So you won't always start from zero. In this game, every time the stars threaten, research always begins from zero. If this feature could improve, I think it's more realistic and fair.
