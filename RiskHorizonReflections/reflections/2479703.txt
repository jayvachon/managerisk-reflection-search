Risk Management is one of the
most difficult and frequently required management in every walk of life. The
game of Risk Horizon smartly teaches the audiences about how to interactively
lead the village into prosperity by building the pods. At the same time it also
makes us aware of the natural shocks like comets that should be perceived. As
the severity of the comets varies, the game inherently makes the player avail
of methods like purchase of insurance, raise the level of protection, and
perform research on comets to deal with comets. Clearly building as many pods
as possible and enhancing them to higher levels is the risk in the game. It’s a
risk because the village is located on an island which is highly prone to comet
strikes. As the comets can destroy the village, all the equity that village has
built may be destroyed.

As a player I have to ensure the
bar on the left of the screen is at or above the white line to progress to next
level which is my goal. The risk horizon offered me different opportunities as
methods of risk management. One such method is Knowledge – research on the
comets that would destroy the village based on its probability to strike on the
planet. The more I researched, the more I could spread the awareness of risk
and the more prepared can the village was leading to minimum destruction. The second
method was insurance. The costlier the insurance plan, the more the premium and
the more the coverage. As a result, in case of destruction, I did not have to
shell out the money but my insurance took care of the damages. Thus, I could
either enhance the pods to next level or build more pods as development of the
village. The third method of protection lied in increasing the height of the
village to avoid the waves from reaching to the pods. While the level of
protection could be enhanced by increasing the height of the village, this
action stopped the development or enhancement of the pods.

Initially, I was unable to advance
to level 3. In level 2, all the development was getting destroyed by shower of
comets. I realized that the research was not enough to actually protect. I religiously
purchased insurance and built pods but once I started researching on comets
with high strike probability, I was able to succeed in level 2. In case, I plan
on taking the game again I would perform more research on comets, while
increasing the level of protection by raising the level of village above the
ground.

I found the game interesting as it motivates the
player to work hard and reduce the damages. Since the protection mechanism is
to increase the level of village as much as possible. In order to enhance the
risk management method, I would like to fix the rate at which the protection
percentage increases. I feel the rate at which I can protect the village needs
to increase. Increasing the rate would give a better control of the situation
to the player. It will help the player get motivation to use the feature of increasing
the level. In other aspects, I believe the game helps in learning the
objectives of using risk management methods.
