Risk management was important to ensure that the development efforts were not annihilated by the falling comets. It was very disheartening to finish building new pods only to see them destroyed when a risk materialised. I found that knowledge was one of the more proactive means of averting the crisis. Protection was also useful, but you could not further development and build at the same time. Insurance was a hefty up front cost, but I was glad that I had it when disaster struck. Overall, it was tricky balancing the needs for development with preparation for risk, especially as the payoffs we're not immediately felt.

I played the game twice. The first time I was too focused on averting risks, so I spent too much time and money on protection, insurance and knowledge and neglected the development of my pods. The second time, I realised that a more balanced approach was necessary if I wanted to succeed in the game. This helped me to realise that often we lose opportunities because we are only concerned about downside risks, but it is important to grow as we'll  otherwise risk management has no purpose. I also appreciated the importance of protection and knowledge over insurance as I felt that these methods were more long-term and yielded better results than simply insuring against the risk. 

In a new version of the game, I would highlight the community aspect of risk management. Although tis was somewhat included within the knowledge/ research  tool, I feel that it is a distinct part of risk management. Especially in small developing communities, social networks are paramount to survival and people and the ecosystem are one and the same. 

Overall, the game was a simple yet effective way of demonstrating how risk management integrates with development.
