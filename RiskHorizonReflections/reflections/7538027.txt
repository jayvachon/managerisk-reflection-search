There are 3 roles played by Risk
Management in this Exercise

·        
Knowledge:
Information gathering about the risk to ensure better preparation 

·        
Protection
- Preparatory Infrastructure improvement measures ( by lifting area to prevent
waves) and also upgrading infrastructure (pods in this case)

·        
Insurance
to minimize damage payment

Approach

·        
Insurance
FIRST – as there is only so much someone can do to prevent risk

·        
KNOWLEDGE
next – Gather basic information on the risk

o  
IF the severity or probability of the risk is
high, focus on PROTECTION first

o  
ELSE focus on building more pods or upgrading
pods

Money spent on Preparation
obviously meant less money for development in the short term. But in the medium
to long term we would have more money for development as damages are minimal and
payments reduced due to insurance whenever risk materializes

Things I would do differently?

·        
In the initial runs, I would pay
more attention towards development and less towards risk management  and this would curtail my progress

·        
I started using Insurance and Protection pieces
more but was not using the Knowledge piece to the fullest which I started using
it more.

·        
Using all forms of risk management is what I started
doing towards the end which provided the best results.

·        
One needs to leverage all forms of Risk
Management was one of my biggest learnings

·        
If given a few chances more, I would like to
understand or make an equation out the pros and cons of each solution

o  
Insurance – Should I go for Option 1,2,3?

o  
How much of an incremental benefit from
obtaining more info?

 

Changes to the game? It is a simple enough model which suits this game.

·        
 Provide
some form of calculator /  risk model to
help make the trade- off related decisions

·        
Explanations on the different risks and money
paid at the end of each round could have been more comprehensive

·        
From a logistics standpoint, the tutorial could
have been more comprehensive
