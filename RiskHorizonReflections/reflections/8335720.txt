In the game, risk management was used as a tool for sustained development. Engaging in research helped me obtain adequate information to predict whether or not the meteorites would hit, and which tools of risk management I should Utilize in order to mitigate damages caused by their occurrence. Insurance help in getting back on my feet after the flood easier and lessen the financial burden. The tradeoffs made during the game depended on decisions i made regarding the use of time and resource. Spending too much time researching on an incoming meteor resulted in less time to protect the village by raising the ground level when other high severity meteors immediately follow the one under study. Insurance put a strain on available resources for further development in the long run as it got more expensive. In general, measures put in place for immediate possible impacts, without regarding future impacts, stifled development in the long run. Planning for both long term and short term provided a more stable condition for development to progress steadily. After playing the games several times, i realised effective risk management as a tool for development can only be achieved when measures for dealing with risks are spread over a variety of tools for a long period of time, and not only focused on one tool. if asked to develop this game id add health insurance
