According to Hallegate, knowledge is understand as the actions which improve understanding of possible shocks and their potential outcomes; that is, contextualized in game, the knowledge of comets decreased the risk of floods in Alora's city; therefore, we can say that people must take in account, not only the challenges where people face them, also people must have an institutional support, because all projects for risk management, will have a satisfactory outcome due to strong institutional capacity. Therefore we can say that choices in managing risk issues are related to institutional initiative.First, use of tecnology in Alora can improve, not only reduced impact of floods in population, also improved their quality of life. The World Bank states that manage of risk can protect quality of life of people in terms of environmental, health, and economic concerns. Alora's funds should go to improve innovation and research in issues stated before; in addition, concerns as health can have an impact in Alorians, because floods could generate a spread that if city are not protected, the population could be affected.Second, we can see in the game a clear process of decisionmaking. In insurance, for example, actions for rebuilding are most important in long term because quality of life are affected; therefore, decisionmaking process in terms of insurance must consider quality of life issues. During the game, there were many options for rebuilding, or elevate plataform without reconstruction. That is, sometimes a risk manager must take in account the insurance variable, because it determines a possible flood in Alora.The game shows how a risk manager does his work; however, it does not show variables or concerns such as example, health issues or in a deeply way, the enviromental concerns. In other words, there is a lack of an important variable: the people's quality of life related to enviromental and health issues (as stated before when risk management must take in account these issues); therefore, in the game should have statistics which  people are sure with their health and enviromental concers, because floods not only destroy buildings and brings a big loss, also illness can affect population.To conclude, I consider this game as a creative way for learning how a risk manager has many decisions to take in account, and how people could contribute to development in terms of risk managing, not only financing projects, also people have the work to have conscience, which risk management can improve their quality of life.
