The risk horizon game is a unique game. At the first glance it looks like any normal internet game with levels, but as I dived inside it, the game became clearer. It represented the basic instinct of taking risk, let me say how, it takes guts to clear your balance to set up the base camps, but the more difficult it gets to protect them, so there is a simple trade off between the ability to take the risk and go ahead with the construction of the camps or else decide judiciously the direction of the attack previously and build the camps at the strategic places . Therefore, no doubt there is always a human desire to be protected , but it comes with a cost, either one needs to take the risk or be safe , this is the general misconception , but it should be in the human nature to have a balance between the two, he/she should take calculated risk (like done in the game), because nobody wants to be out of the game in a single round :). So, effective risk taking strategy comes with effective planning of your ideas and concepts. The game taught this thing very nicely, and i really appreciate it for giving me the insight into the core of the risk strategies. If i played it again i would plan more carefully when to build the camps and allocate the budget tactfully.If i need to modify one thing in the game, i would add more adversary conditions with each passing level , like addition of more attacks, however at the same time i shall include some strong mechanisms to combat those, but they shall come with a price. This addition shall reflect the decision making capacity of a manager at the time of heavy disturbance, and by taking a small risk he/she can go upto the last level, but by avoiding some thing it would be harmful for them, and they shall introspect their decision later on.
