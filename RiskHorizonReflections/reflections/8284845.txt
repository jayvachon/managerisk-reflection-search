Throughout the course of the game I had to weigh up costs benefits
of the different methods of risk management. For example, I found there to be a
significant disincentive to invest in both protection and insurance at the same
time. On one of my play-throughs, I invested heavily in protection keeping the
bar near the top, this enabled me to combat the vast majority of comets hits
without receiving any damage by researching them and using the accumulated time
to build community connections, meaning I had no need to buy insurance for the
most part, however, whilst applying this strategy on another play-through I was
hit by a series of very severe comets near the end of the round and was not
able to protect against all of them, as my defences were eroded by each comet
and I did not have time to repair them. Without insurance I lost a lot of
development and suffered a large amount of damage, which I was not able to
recover from. Like the example given in this week’s video lectures about better
flood defence making floods less frequent and making residents less likely to
prepare themselves for floods, I found myself preparing less for damage caused by
comets by not buying insurance and keeping less in the way of savings. This
ultimately resulted in a shock that I could not recover from in time. 

Additionally, I found myself trading-off between the formal insurance
offered by the game and informal insurance. Whilst the game offered a formal
paid-for policy that pays out in the event of a comet there was also the option
to delay some development spending and store some money as savings rather than
spend immediately so that there was some money stored for repairs. In this
sense there were immediate effects of risk management, in that not purchasing
insurance allowed me to immediately invest more money in development (the costs
of risk management were immediate), but longer term risks from not purchasing
the insurance, as the cost of not having insurance if disaster struck was a
higher cost of repairing the damage (the benefits of risk management are
uncertain and usually in the future).  In
the end I settled on a combination of the two: some insurance combined with
some savings. Overall this shift to a more balanced approach is what changed
most about my strategy from play-through to play-through. At first I tried to
invest heavily in one method of protection, but found it advantages to adopt a balanced
method using protection, insurance and research roughly equally. 

Were I to redesign the game to take account of the situation
where I live, I would take account of the possibility of risk management that
is not planned properly having negative consequences. For example coastal erosion
and flooding is a problem where I live and whilst properly planned coastal
defences have protected the local population from coastal erosion with limited
impact on the surrounding area, poorly planned defence measures have led to increased
erosion and flooding in areas surrounding the defences, but not protected by
them.
