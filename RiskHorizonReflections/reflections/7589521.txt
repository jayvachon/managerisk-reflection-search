The role of risk management in this game was to enable us to take informed decesion and learn from our mistakes. Initially when I played I put all the money in development without taking adequate insurance. Luckily a couple of meteors missed and I survived but not for long. After that I always took the highest insurance without realizing the severity of the meteors. So I spent more on insurance than what was necessary. It took a few iterations to find a good balance.After a while I found good balance between development, insurance and severity of meteors. At times I would stop development when the expected "chance of Hit" or "Severity" by a meteor was very high. But I still failed to cross level 2. I will play a bit more to find out the optimam balance between development, protection and uncertainity.I feel the game can get rid of the "Slider" next to Insurance button. Instead I feel you should add "coping" factor. "Coping" from back to back disasters is much tougher both in terms of emotions/physic as well as finances.
