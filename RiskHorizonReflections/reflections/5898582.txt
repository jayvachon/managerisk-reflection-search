1) Risk management
in this game manifests in two ways one is building resilience (the ability to recover
from sea waves generated by the comets); the second is building prosperity
(being able to use money to build and upgrade plots).

The key point
here is being able to manage both time and money (resources).

What I
really focused on was knowledge and tried to use protection and insurance minimum
time. This technique saved me a lot money in which I built more plots and
upgraded them.

This gave
the opportunity to have a good development is some time.

2) As one
plays more his experience grows; the same as real life risk management where
time after time knowledge and different techniques to attack the risk is occurred.

 If I played the game I would invest more in
knowledge rather than protection and insurance in the early stages.

I have
learned from the game that managing resources (time and money) are very important.

3)  The change I would propose would be introducing
more than one risk, which one can encounter in real life. This would be challenging
and more life realistic where good risk management practice is needed to direct
the resources to the right time and right place.
