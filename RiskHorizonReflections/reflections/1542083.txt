When i started to play the strategic game i knew that the resources available for building a project like this are scarce and the risk is high. Not only do I have to research and learn the threats to the project, but also to protect and buy insurance for what i already built on the island. And doing all this while the main resource - TIME - is running out quickly !!
At first try i started to build only part of the island, because i was afraid of the risk from incoming comets and the damage they will cause. Then i understood the importance of community connections ans restarted to build with all the available money (hoping that if i run out of money i will be able to lend money from the World Bank). Then i protected the island from the invadind comets while studying the comets for better protection in the future (knowledge is power).
The role of risk management in the game was to balance between all the available resources: Money to build the island, research of the comets that threaten to destroy or damage what has been built, protection of the buildings and finaly buying insurance that will reduce the cost of damage because protection is never 100%. And all that with time running out quickly.
To prepare for good risk management you have to research and study the risks. Preparation for risk affect development  because this takes time, money and efforts - on the cost of developing the project. So one change i would propose to better represent the risk management choices in an improved game is that the comet research phase will run in parallel to the development, because in reality the research group of people is not the same as the building group and they can run in parallel time (not  in parallel money). Another change  i would propose is to give more time to play. 3 minutes is too short time to take serious decisions in a strategic game although you can repeat the game over and over again.
