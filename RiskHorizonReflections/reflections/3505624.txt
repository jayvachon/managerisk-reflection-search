Firstly, I would like to say the risk management game was
thought carefully and was a good easement of our knowledge on the course martial.
The purpose of the game was to see our understanding of risk and the necessary
step required to overcome the difficulties that were encounter in the game. For
example, I had the knowledge of comets hitting my town (that was the risk) and
insurance was my protection. By spending extra money to insure my properties instead
of building more, I was able to protect the properties I build instead of
losing everything I had due to the comets. 

                If I only
played the game once I would only build few buildings and spend my money only the
research because I’m trying to last us long us I can without taking many risk. This
is due to the nature of the game. If I take lots of risk at the end I might
lose everything I had and would have to start from the beginning again. But if
you get to play the game again and again, I would take many risks, for example I
wouldn’t spend money on research, instead I would buy insurance if something
happens the insurance can cover me and my losses wouldn’t be much.  From the game I learned that taking risk advancers
might have high rate of return, and that a calculated gamble should be taken.  

One thing I would change about the game is to show the
player the abound percent they would lose if comet hit there city. By doing so,
each players will have better understanding to how they should strategize to an
outcome the favors there path. Out I found was when I ignore some comets, there
affect was very high.  All and all the
game was good, and enjoined playing it.
