Begin with developing all your resources into pods as soon as the game starts.My first objective was to research and
assess what kind of damage a comet could cause. Knowing the severity
of the hit, helps to determine the tradeoff between protection and
insurance.I am not sure by how much does the
preparation of risk actually affects actual damage. As any kind of
damage does drain the green energy bar.

I did play the game several times. The
objective was to get development fast enough to clear the level. And
this requires a mix of insurance and protection. At this stage,
research time was immaterial, just assessing the severity of the
impact was good enough to choose between insurance and protection.As the game progressed the main goal
was to mitigate the severity of comet impact either by protection or
with insurance.
Ideally at higher levels the success of
the game was to get protection, as it could nullify comet impacts.The tradeoff at the higher levels was
to choose protection and allow for sufficient development to raise
the green bar to clear the level.I would add a coping mechanism, that
allows the planet to recover dependent on the level and research on
the pods. This would be the additional component I would add to the
game.This can reflect the fact that lesser
developed economies are more severally affected while more developed
economies are less affected
