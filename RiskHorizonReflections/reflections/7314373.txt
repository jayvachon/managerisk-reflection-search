During the Risk
Horizon Game, as the Luminator of
Alora, I started to develop our community to the best by building the first
pods in the middle area since it did not usually affect by the
wave. I built the following pods starting from the inside part of the shore
toward outside in order to minimize the damages. The area which is closer to
the shore suffers the highest damage of wave. While I was building the first 3
pods, I bought the insurance 33% package.  Since I was planning to do research on Comet
and to take other preventive mesures, I expected that the damage would not be more
than 33%. Therefore, purchasing 33% insurance package is a realistic and cost
effective opportunities to balance retention programs of growing community with
commercial insurance. 

I would do the
research on the comets as soon as it appeared until it hit or missed and
prepare the shock based on severity and chance of comet hitting and the time
until impact. By accumulating the research, I was able to receive more time to
create community connections right before the comet hits. I found out that, in
some case, having enough time is very critical to raise my island upward to a
certain level for long term protection against the wave.

During developing the community, all
sources of risk, including flooding and coastal erosion, the probability and consequences
of the risk are important to identify specifically. The type of receptors or
researches for wave and comet are also proceeded. All preventative measures for
potential shock such as updating the building system, buying insurance and
implementing proper evacuation plan should always be taken in order to reduce
the impact severity of the wave. For instance, having the insurance for
building at shore will help the wave’s victim to repair the building at minimum
cost.

If I am tasked for a new version of
the game, I will add the process of adding wetland.
