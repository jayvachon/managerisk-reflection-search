Risk management is the process of confronting risk, preparing for
them and coping with their effects. In this case, the risk is provoked by the
possibility of a comet crashing. In order to pursue this goal it is necessary
to carry out an effective management of risk; combining the capacity to prepare
in advance with the ability to cope afterwards. To achieve the goal, the game
provides us with three instruments: protection, knowledge and insurance.At first I was really focus on knowledge because I thought that
knowledge was the most important part but I soon realized that the knowledge
was not enough: I needed protection. I started with protecting the village from
the waves that were caused by the crash of the comet in the ocean. With this
technic I could not pass level three. That is why I started to protect the
village upgrading all the pods. I became obsessed with saving money for
repairing and upgrading the pods because it coasted a lot. I also started to
invest in insurance to avoid big damages in the village.

It all worked until level five, when I suffer from huge comets
crushing in the village. That is why I realized that I had to keep up with the
insurance part because it saved me a lot of many and time in reparations. I
also realized that I had to match more precisely the protection level with the
severity of the comet. That is how I managed to succeed at the game and reach
level six.

Finally, I came up with the conclusion that it was necessary to
maintain equality between the resources I was given with: protection, knowledge
and insurance.

 If I had to change an aspect of the game in order to represent in a
better way the risk management choices that matter in the place I live, I would
add the evacuation fact because no village will exist without residents. This would mean that people
who played the game had to spend not only a lot of resources but a lot of time
in the evacuation.
