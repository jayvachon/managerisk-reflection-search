The role of risk management involves capacity building,
accumulation of the previous knowledge for pro-activeness and building new for
forecast, insurance and protection for the probable losses and casualties.
Basically, knowledge provides a medium or channel for protection through
insurance. Sometimes the knowledge of exact happening (result of research)
helps to reduce the insurance cost. Hence, investment in research can lower
down the insurance cost and build terms for effective protection. Preparation
for risk affects development through change in focus and context. It might
change short term and long term goal while change context for investment,
re-investment, and protection costs and level of protection. 

Playing game once gives us the situations' overview and actors
that can change the course of situation. Infact, it does not ensure “why and how”
to act in a particular situation. While playing it again can provide brief
explanation but does not support estimation of risk and investment.
Alternatively, playing game more than once will enhance experience has provides
accurate bases for risk estimation and preparation for mitigation of risk
through observation. The main things about the game are that observation skills
and research skills helps to create focus that leads to timely decision and preparation.
Similarly, it also help to allocated resources for value maximization through
prioritization in protection and investment. I would like to propose the shift of insurance cost
and investment dragging facility to the area that is more prone for risk in
short term. This helps to inject out investment at high risk area and push
insurance to more risky areas.
