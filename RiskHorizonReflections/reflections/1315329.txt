The role of risk management in the game is that
you must weigh all options: saving vs spending, development vs insurance and/or
prevention and/or saving for repairs. Acquiring knowledge took valuable time
away from development and prevention. Risk management slowed development as
resources (time and funds) needed to be diverted. It made clear the
importance of resource availability in order to have higher levels of
development while also allowing for risk management. I
played the game 4 times in order to reach the 4th level. I learned that you
need to maintain some funds in reserve for repairs, develop early on because it
takes time, and make larger investments in insurance when you have higher
development. My initial attempts failed after level 2 every time as I
was too conservative with my investments in development and spent too many
funds on insurance, regardless of the likelihood of a comet impact. My 4th
attempt was unique because I ensured that I held on to reserve funds in the earlier
levels to invest in further development and higher insurance coverage as the
levels continued. If I were to attempt for a 5th time, I would be
even more frugal in the early levels to encourage more development later on,
have funds available in case of an impact, and spend less on insurance. The
one change I would make is for location to affect the outcomes of the natural
disasters. The area near the water should be more costly to insure, cheaper to
build perhaps, and more susceptible to damage. When I started to
play the game, I assumed this would be so and focused my development on the inland
areas. I live in East Asia where we can see even now with the Japanese typhoon
that proximity to water for certain types of disasters vastly increases risk.
(Of course in this game, the area is not actually that large so all of the
areas would be hit fairly equally. But to demonstrate a point it could be
modified to my suggestion.)
