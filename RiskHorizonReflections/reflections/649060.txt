The role of the risk management
is to minimize the damage that caused by those comet to the pod. During the
game, I used all three tactics (knowledge, protection and insurance). I think
all preparation will help to preserve my pod development. Preparation for risk
won’t affect development immediately. We can only experience the usefulness of
the preparation for risk is when the risk comes. Preparation of risk helps us
to minimize the damage or even prevent from any damage.

I have used too much time to
observe every comet and build as many as observation in every comet in the
first time. At second time, I will observe every comet first and build up
enough protection regarding to their severity. If I noticed one comet can cause
severe damage and I don’t have enough time to build enough protection, I will
purchase insurance and then observe the comet as long as possible to gain full
mark in the observation then I can have more time to play the connection game
when that comet hit my planet. 

The main thing I learn from this game is that we need to adopt knowledge,
protection, and insurance to
achieve the best result from the game. We need to use knowledge, protection and
insurance at the right time to maximize our return. When the damage is too
high, protection is no longer the best strategy for the game instead of
insurance. Sometimes, we just cannot avoid all risks but to face them. In this
situation, insurance would be a better way to minimize the damage caused by the
risk.

The
technology level of building a pod or the resilience level of a pod can be
added to the game to make it more realistic. For example in real life, after
many earthquakes in Japan, Buildings in Japan are more resilience than before.
