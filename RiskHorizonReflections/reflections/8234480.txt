Risk management played the most important role in the development of Alora world. There was no way the illuminator would have achieved the milestones set along the way without risk management. In managing knowledge, protection, and insurance, She was able to increase the rate of development, hence raising the bar.To achieve this, one had to balance the delicate act of growing the community and preparing for the potential threats. The use of research was paramount in guiding the type and amount of development. Research provided the information on the probability and intensity of the hazards, and in turn gave an indication of how much insurance was needed. Many are the times that one had to spend more time on research at the expense of development -reason being that there was no point in investing heavily on what could be at risk without proper insurance. By doing research and predicting what was coming/what was known, one was able to pick the right insurance, hence cushioning the needed development.Community protection offered the last layer of protection against the intensity of threats. Risk management in the long run was responsible for the vibrant development experienced in Alora. Each of the four components of good risk management was costly in terms of money or time, but failure to manage would have had dire consequences.(Remember the Oh No! expressions that escaped your mouth every time your ponds were destroyed by the comets, and you didn't have enough insurance, and you had to start all over again--the frustrations!) To pursue opportunity, in this case development, one had to confront risk.2-   In playing this  game, I learned the importance of keeping a balance between research/knowledge, insurance, and protection. All these components are essential in managing risk and creating opportunities.3- I would probably want to represent some of the choices that people faced by these threats have to make when buying Insurance. It is not just a matter of how much you want to get but whether you can afford it. These are choices faced by many people not only in the developing world but the developed world as well.Secondly, I would incorporate  coping as a component of good risk management. I feel that this component was not well exemplified catered for in this game.
