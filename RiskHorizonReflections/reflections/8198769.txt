Risk management in the game was so helpful as it help me to reduce the severity of the loss that was incurred as a result of the hit of a comet. The choice i made in the game was to secure my pod with the plan to buy an insurance cover. My preparation for the risk really help me to reduce the effect of a loss and evenÂ  if a loss a occur i was indemnified due to the insurance cover. after my first game i bought a highly priced insurance cover so as to cushion my from higher loss suffered from the hit of a comet. Moreover i did not realized the need to buy an insurance cover until i lost my first game. the game really did captured various area of risk management in the sense that i was able to really have a practical experience of risk management were i had the alternative of buying an insurance cover at different prices. Also one addition i would have made to the game was to add popups so as to help give some clear cut instruction on how to play the game and which step to take at any point in time.
