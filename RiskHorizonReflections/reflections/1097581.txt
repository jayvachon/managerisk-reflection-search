The role of risk management was very critical in the game in terms of evaluating the risk and managing the potential after effects of the meteor strikes on the pods. The choices that I made involve conducting the maximum amount of research possible into the effects of the meteor strikes and the chances of a strike. I realized that there was only so many resources available to allocate between the knowledge (research into the meteor strikes), protection (raising the level of the island) and securing insurance protection against the strikes. Preparation for risk affected development at a somewhat delayed stage and was not always a direct effect.If i played the game only once, chances are high that I would try to spend all my resources on building as many pods as possible without paying much attention to the effects of meteor strikes. What I did differently when playing the game a multiple number of times is to take into account the potential effects of the meteor strikes and start spending a lot more resources on the research instead, in order to have a better risk management plan in place. The main things I learned from the game were the enormous benefits of having advance knowledge about the threat of risk as well as the level of the potential damage, along with the need to have insurance in place in the event of these strikes actually taking place.If there was an additional way to factor in the behavioral responses of the residents and possibly to alter them, leading to better risk management techniques in the future, this would be a more realistic way to represent choices in real life.
