The role of risk management in the game is based in some decisions we need to take in several ways:1 – The probability of an accident;2 – The insurance we take;3 – The protection we have.For all these issues we need to combine the development with the prevention and preparation for the disasters. We need to have money to combine these two crucial issues. The 3 factors (prevention, preparation and money) are the major keys to success in the development.I played the game 3 times and all the times I had different strategies.  I learned what I referred above. We need money to develop but also we need a good prevention to prevent damages like insurance with 75% of protection and watch the probability of disaster. In the last game I played I developed faster and the goals went rapidly in the target.After played the game the improvement I suggest is to make some input like temperature or flood because can be other variable to make more complex the game in the last level.
