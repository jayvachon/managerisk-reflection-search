The
role of risk management in the Risk Horizon game was to prevent Alora city to
be destroyed by the arrival of comets. The risk of the impact of comets was
decreased by building pods and using the powers of research, protection and
insurance.

To
keep the city safe I used all the three powers. There was no way in which using
them individually the city would survive. Sometimes I got caught up on giving
protection to Alora and forgot about the other two powers I had in hand,
research and insurance. The power of insurance was the one to be overlooked by
me. And evidently it is a very important and effective way to address risk
management. 

As
the game shows is a very costly enterprise to manage risk, but the exercise
also shows that as knowledge, preparation and insurance are address in a timely
manner at the end it pays off the cost of investing in advance to manage risks.

One
thing I found particularly interesting is the aspect of risk management that demonstrate
how connecting with communities helps increase protection and prevent damage. I
think that it is a stage of risk management that is constantly ignore in many
countries and from my point of view is as indispensable as the other three
powers of the game. From the very center of family communities to the big
picture of governance they lack of vision towards the union of people working
for people as a team. Especially if governments truly believe and act  in favor of managing risk properly and involve
the citizens in decision making and brainstorming of ideas to solve the issues
that would help enormously the impact of risk management.
