                The role of risk management in this
game appears to be obvious. To win the game it is necessary to build, building representing
development. However they are comets threatening to destroy what you are building.
To prevent destruction you have different possibilities. It is important to
choose the right amount of each possibility. The major dilemma is that when you
are protecting your buildings, you are not creating new ones. It means that
protecting from risk completely impede you from developing at all. In this game
if you do not develop you lose. Moreover, if you use all the money on creating new
buildings and not protecting at all, they are great chances that they will all
be destroyed and that the money invested will be wasted. In the first levels,
by dividing your money in an even way between development and protection,
reconstruction and insurance, you succeed easily. There is also a “luck”
component depending on the strength of the comet and the time it chooses to
hit.

Lessons
learnt from this game is that in order to develop it is necessary to face the
risk by building even if they can be destroy, to prevent the risk from having disastrous
consequences thank to research, protection, and insurances, and finally to cope
with the risk by repairing after destruction. What I believe I need to do
differently if I have more time to continue playing the game is to prioritize
construction, while minimizing the consequences of the comet falling, so that
coping with the disaster will be easier. 

If I could
change simple things on this game to make risk management more understandable
would be to give a little more time for strategy building. In the game there is
no time for recovery, no time for learning from previous mistakes. In reality I
believe the difference is that there is nearly too much time and that
populations or authorities forget the lessons learnt previously. I strongly
believe that risk management should not be done in contexts of emergency but
prepared when there is no risk ahead. Moreover this game encourages me to
question myself on the necessity of constructing in a hurry as the best image
for development. In my opinion it is better not to develop at all then to develop
without thinking about it. This game might be a little too simple in its
conception to illustrate a dilemma that is much more complex and which integrated
many different components.(On the first assignment explanation it is written that we must write 400 words, which I did. I think my essay is a good resume of everything I needed to say!)
