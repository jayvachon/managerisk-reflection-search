Risk Horizon was a practical way to confront and apply the
components of risk management, as policy makers are similarly tasked.  I tended
to build first, then do research to determine shock imminence and severity.   Each action
had a true cost and an opportunity cost, so doing more research meant less time
for building, upgrading, repairs, or protection.  The game definitely showed in real money terms
that good preparation for risk, produced immediate effects in development, and
long term effects in mitigation and coping of the communities.

After using the tutorial and playing the first time, I
learned that research was pivotal to successful risk management.  If research indicated that shock severity and
imminence were low, then I would buy insurance, because it proved cheaper than
when a shock was perhaps 80-90% sure to happen. 
I would also continue development, upgrading and protection at these low risk
periods.  Research was not stagnant and
sustained monitoring produced changes in knowledge, to better inform choices regarding
protection, insurance, building, upgrading and repairs.   When
Research was at maximum capacity of 10, damage from shock was
significantly lowered, driving repair costs and time frame downward, sometimes to nil.  Building and protection went hand in hand
with direct, positive and immediate effects on development. 
When a shock was imminent it was too late to protect development and too
expensive to insure against its impact.  Insurance --especially the maximum packages available -- really helped to keep repair costs down, and smaller repair costs translated into less extensive repairs, and thus faster recovery.  Also, the more advanced the stage of development, the more important Research became in mitigating repair costs, which were rising with every new level of upgrading.  Protecting the community was expensive from an opportunity cost
perspective, but it was very useful to have invested in such research, because
it also helped to drive down shock impact and  repair costs, and made coping easier.  Sometimes though, even when insurance was in
hand, protection applied and research efforts sustained, damage was still high
perhaps to demonstrate that information can still be imperfect, and that high
damage may not necessarily indicate poor risk management.  Ultimately I learned that risk management can be low pressure during low risk periods and high pressure as risk probability and severity rises.  Successful risk management calls for striking a balance between choices made  for development, upgrading, protection and resilience building activities, during low and high risk periods, all within a context of limited resources, changing information, and time sensitive development goals.  

If Risk Horizon had to be altered to simulate
the risk management choices in my region, perhaps I would change the shocks to more
than just one type.  In the Caribbean
region we are affected by hurricanes, earthquakes, severe flooding, landslides
to name a few, and sometimes one can follow or cause the other.   I may
also change it so that a player who has successfully navigated up to level 2,
does not start again at Level 1, if unsuccessful at Level 3.  My rationale is that attaining Level 2 means
some success in risk management – community linkages and strengthening,
development and  upgrading, and continued
research and protection.  Resumption at
Level 2 may simulate more real life scenarios in that, not all shocks return us
to ground zero – the place before any risk management strategy was applied.
