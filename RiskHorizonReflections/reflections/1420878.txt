Risk management had very critical role in the development of Pods. Risk management helped mitigate the  risk and allowed development to continue. Research provided knowledge to prepare against the comet. Protection provided physical protection for minimizing the impact. Insurance took off high costs for repairs. Knowledge of the risk i.e. severity of the comets, potential damage covered by flexible insurance cover, and protection measure to increase the platform height were pivotal. I utilized little knowledge,  more insurance and lots of protection to mitigate the risk. Preparation paid off after sometime as first comet caused damage but pods were repaired before next comet hit. Costs were taken care by insurance. More research allowed more time to update communities which was very crucial to minimize the risk.If I played game differently, I would try to do more research and start applying protection immediately. I would choose minimum insurance plan at the start and change it before comet hits based on severity and possibility of hitting. Pod development would continue meanwhile. I would develop existing pods to next levels so that green barometer levels are achieved faster and development momentum is maintained.I learnt that effective risk management for development is right combination of knowledge of the danger, protection from potential damage and proper insurance to cover monetary losses. The concept can be applied for all kinds of risks we face in our lives. Preparation is the key!One change I would like to have in the new version of the game is to have coordinated system for doing research and applying protection accordingly. So that I can put resources for doing research while utilizing the real-time knowledge to apply protection measures accordingly well well within time.
