I played the game for several times, until I succeeded the round four. It is not that easy as I thought at the beginning. It is a combination of strategy (risk management), and luck , just as in the real life.Resource is limited, as always, limited time, limited budget, danger is constant hanging around. In order to survive, one should have himself good prepared and protected. I started the game without reading the instruction, as a result I lose very quickly. With no knowledge, protection and insurance I could not expect more. After I learned all the tricks, which are, getting closer watch to each star, knowing its intense and possibility (knowledge); constructing the city (protection); buying insurance. All three thicks enhance the chance of survive, but all of them consume the limited resource: constructing the city needs a lot of time, so that you will be short of time for the buildings and for watching the stars; buying insurance is so expensive and gets more expensive in higher round that you have to wait for long to save the money, waiting eats up your time. That is a good trade off among these tricks. Sometimes luck play another important role. Even if you got good prepared and insured, the star can hit much heavier than your research showed; even worse, it hits after you finished some really expensive buildings, remember that insurance pays you no more than 70% lost.Â From the view of game design, it is almost perfect: simple to understand but covers all important concept of risk management. Technique seen, it can run quicker, especially calculating damage could be quicker.
