1.    By the help of risk management I was able to cope up the damage and instability caused by the natural occurring disasters.Choices and tradeoffs         - In terms of knowledge Whenever the severity of the comet attack was high the research was required as it gives you more time to create community connection right before the comet hits, helping boost your protection. Also when the severity was low or the chances of hit was low, research was ignored as the society was already prepared for these level of shocks.         - In terms of protection Whenever the severity was high it was important to match the level of protection, indicated by the meter to the right of the slider, with the severity of the comet, as it prevented the pods from being damaged. It was the best way to protect from the attack effectively.         - In terms of insurance  Whenever the severity was very high and the research and protection was not enough to overcome the shock (I mean whenever the damage was guaranteed ) it was best to have the insurance as by having insurance, pods damaged from flooding were rebuild quickly and cheaply. Insurance also helped to recover the lost development time after pods were repaired.       Preparation was very important because if you are not prepared for the disasters you can never reach the desired level of development. Also it was important to reduce the adverse effect.2.    I played the game four times. What I learnt was high level of development was helpful in everything be it having more money for insurance or for raising the platform to desired height. But the main thing I learned was by using the three powers (knowledge, protection, insurance) in concert with development, I was able to create a healthy community. Also I learned that the only way to succeed is to find the perfect balance.3.    Demography as well as topography as it will give the game a real time reflection.
