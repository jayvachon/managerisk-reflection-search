Risk Horizon is a simple but a very interesting game that helps us to obtain some practical knowledge about importance of risk management to succeed. The main role of risk management in the game is to identify, evaluate and reduce risks of damaging the growing city by objects from the space. And if the damage was happened, repair it cheaply (with proper insurance police). In the game I made many choices based on knowledge about space objects (probability of hit, power of posible damage), level of protection (upgrade or not the landscape) and the price for insurance (what policy to buy) to get the best result. Olso, need to mention, preparation for risk affected development immediately in this high paced environment.Each time when I played the game again I tried different strategies in risk management to achieve the better result in development. I paid mone attention to knowledge about space objects and tried to calculate quickly what type of insurance I need to buy (if anyone).There were many thing I learned from the game:- you need to be highly adaptable for changing environment to make right dicisions;- all risks must be properly evaluated;- gathering a required amount of information is very helpful for risk analysis and continious development;- information about past events can be very useful as well as for insurance decisions and for the risk minimization;- the more we prepared more benefits we will obtain from risk management;- insurance can be very helpful when it used with reasons and clear reasons;- anyone can achieve good results with proper risk management;- the fourth planet is the deadliest )There are many uncertainties in the place where I from. Therefore I would propose to add to the game some unexpected events for each level with some limited time to choose from proposed variants for solving them. I my opinion it will help not only better represent the risk management choices but also approximate the game closer to our life.
