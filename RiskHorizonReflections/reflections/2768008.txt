A comet or a meteor is going to strike creating a direct
impact on land through direct hit or the waves which in turn will cause a
calamity. The role of the risk management was to create an adequate
infrastructure to deal with the impact of the natural calamity.

The choices in the game was to do the research on the
meteor, get insurance and make pods which will help protect the living population
when the calamity strikes. The trade – off which was controlled by us was
getting an insurance. Building of pods was a time consuming process and the
idea of the impact of the meteor could not be easily justified.

The knowledge was through the research regarding the meteor
striking and its impact, the protection was undertaken to build the pod and
upgrade to various levels, the insurance was acting as the cushion for the
risk.

The preparation for the risk in terms of building pods was
important and the impact after the calamity was over the recovery became the
immediate concern. It did stall the process of development but it was extremely
important.

 I did play game more
than once, and there were different permutation and combinations were tried in
terms of building pods, doing research and developing the area. The insurance
was utmost necessary and it was bought as soon as it was available. It speeded
the process of recovery.

The main things learnt from the game were that knowledge is
important in order to plan and strategize, but the back up plan must also be
ready to deal with the impact of the natural calamity. 

The game did capture some aspect of risk management, the one
thing which I would change is the information available in terms of topography,
pods needed to be built time taken and once the level is not cleared the
explanation for the same. So that we become much more aware about the dynamics
for solving the problem or the situation which we will encounter and rectify
the plans as per the situation demand.
