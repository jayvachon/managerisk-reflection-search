As I started  playing the game and got a jest of  the situation at “alora” I realized that it was endangered by the risk of comets falling in the sea nearby  and how that opened “alora” up for many risks like high waves  which could devastate the city with its by effects but as I continued the play in the game I realized that how the effects of the disasters could be managed by us with the help of effective tools of risk and management like research, protection and insurance, with the help of insurance I could insure the pods and even if the disaster occur I could benefit with the less rate of development of the effected pods and by increasing the height of the surface I we could sometimes avoid the high waves, also with the help of the tools of risk management I realized if we are completely prepared for a disaster in every way possible we can fully escape from its effects.
As I started playing the game I faced a lot of trade-offs between research, knowledge and protection as sometimes I had to concentrate more on the development of the community and not on the research of the upcoming risks but with a proper balance between all the components of the risk management I was able to effectively manage the risk and reduce its effects to the most.
There were times when focusing on protection of “alora” and researching about the upcoming comets reduced the level of the development of the community and the pods but at last it was seen that though the rate of development of the “alora” was slow at that time, the effective protection and research helped in a great extent to avoid disasters and there devastating effects.
I played the game twice and the thing which I did differently from the first time was to indulge in all the key factors equally unlike the first time when I concentrated majorly on development and in a way sided protection and research about threats which led to devastating effects later, the next time  through a proper balance between all the three allowed me to utilize all the resources properly and effectively reduce the effects of the disaster and accelerate the development of the community.
The main things which I learnt from the game was that keeping an effective balance between all the components of the risk management would help us to escape the devastating effects of the risks and also helps us to successfully develop the economy the game made me realize that there could be sometime in the economy when the growth rate could be slow because of the more  concentration on research and protection from the upcoming risks but it is equalized by the less effects of the risks on their actual arrival on the economy.
One thing which I would add if I had to make another version of the game to represent the risk and management choices that matter in my place would be conservation of rainwater, in the game there could be a section of rainfall which could be saved by the player if has good rainwater saving infrastructure so if he invests on conserving the rain water he can later benefit with it during the time of the drought when there is a lot of water scarcity and the development rate is low this way the player would be effectively prepare of drought and help the community to overcome it successfully with the proper risk and management measures.
