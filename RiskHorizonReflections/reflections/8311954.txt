KNOWLEDGE: (1) Research was
only as effective as the time and resources invested into it (2) Research needed
to be prioritized in accordance with set priorities in terms of urgency and
importance (3) Even if an asteroid was thoroughly researched, the outcome was
sometimes much better or worse than anticipated due to unknown factors (hence
it's critical to always be used in conjunction with other measures and not
accepted as the complete truth) (4) Having sufficient knowledge beforehand
improved the response time to the shock, and thus could be proactively used to further
reduce the impact (5) A quick assessment of a risk could sometimes give
a good overview of potential outcomes but was not sufficientÂ  in an environment with various threats to
which appropriate priorities had to be assigned.

INSURANCE: (1) Insurance
definitely provided more benefit than cost (2) When insurance costs were high
and threats could be predicted well ahead of time (ideal world) it was better
to rather focus funds on productivity and allow sufficient time to earn enough
to pay for insurance just before a shock was encountered (the game was relatively
predictable in terms of when shocks would occur, however, it's not always so predictable in the real world) (3) It was better use of time,
finances and even emotional energy to pay for the best insurance the first time
(4) Paying for insurance after a major shock was not efficient use of funding as compared to immediate purchase of insurance (5) Unlike other
protection measures, insurance was easy to measure in terms of how much money
was saved.

PROTECTION: (1) Building up sufficient protection had financial implications but took even more
time than funding (2) Even shocks that didn't damage permanent infrastructure
could damage systems that protected this infrastructure (3) Protection measures
did not increase financial gain exponentially, as did other business, and as such
it was tempting to leave this lengthy activity until it was too late (4) The
simpler the protection was, the easier it was to maintain amidst many shocks (5)
In the absence of shocks, even a complex protection barrier could be easily
maintained (in real life this is more of an active process than in the game but
still holds true).

Though there is room for improvement, it was a useful tool for demonstrating the principles of knowledge, insurance, and protection and definitely adds to the course - Great Initiative!
