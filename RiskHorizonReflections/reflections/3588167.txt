1.a)Risk Horizon proposes to model an exercise of risk management of natural disasters in terms of:      repair costs      interruption/lagged interventions = LOSSES ↔ downtime      effects on the environment      insurance costsAs in the case of INTEGRAL Risk Management schemes it assumes that:     -risk is inevitable therefore risk taking is ever present ↔ risk taking is essential     -Illuminator’s profile risk-taking/aversion may render ↑hazardous an scenario and is different amongst participating subjectsIt aims at systematically select cost-effective approaches for minimizing the effect of threat realization to the island.Alora’s primary threat are comets  NOT famine, drought, economic collapse or unemployment. It was the pioneering advantage of the first Illuminator, a relentless observer of Alora’s beautiful sky at night, which made an allowance for development. When meteorites collide with Alora, devastating floods ensue posing great danger. Such powerful natural disaster is therefore systemic and, imposes the risk of flooding. A plethora of opportunities challenge the dangerous situation of these uncertain, negative events and subsequent associated losses. Recursive procedures set forth good risk management reportedly addressing the severity and chance of a hit thanks to the achievements of advanced technology. Alorans pride themselves on efficiency and the beauty of design.  Idiosyncracy henceforth increases resilience making it easier to repair less damage in good value (Coursera Code CJKP7XZ / 151st Illuminator (Coursera Code dwsEUBp)). Greater chances of survival are presumed via sharing of resources; connected neighbours and community organizations help each other, pods get connected as floods come in. Forming and sustaining connections is of relevance. The need for greater accuracy due to imperfect information  fosters research and the offer of various types of insurance. Missed opportunities to otherwise address incoming shock by non-discriminating attention to research results, as characterized in terms of severity (highest impact simulated at level 10, current sample exposed to a level 6 at highest), probability of impact and, reported damage ex-post (%) -both upon impact and at the end of trials- by constrast to paid insurance, afforded protection and accumulated research, bring forward a ‘cost of reducing risk’.The WorldReport2014 points to natural disasters as the most common disadvantageous occurrence across countries, in its time series 2005-11.The prioritization of tasks at perceived critical junctures, while at times under the threat of incoming shocks and a cofounded risk to accidental vulnerability generate as such strategies that may entail credit risk and the transfer or sharing of liabilities appurtenant to the uncertain occurrence of meteoritic events: building, restoration, renovation, refurbished shield support, risk sharing via insurance and building up research are the various listed tasks to manage.b)Frequent options were entertained between building additional pods and its subsequent upgrade, while exposed to meteorites of varying destructive intensity and, the availability of both resources and protection to be shielded from hits. The net ‘trade-off’ was level attainment, proportional to the timely and balanced allocation of resources to successfully develop.c)It may have led to an alternative –discriminative- pattern of –perhaps equally random-  allocation of resources; it is not all that clear in what order concord may have been advanced in Alora.2.a)Would review instructions, switch browser, mouse and keyboard. b)Discontinue idle time as much as possible.c)forward pruning is of the essence,  overfitting may occur, the underlying relational design may be  somewhat imprinted by indication for the purposes of this course (and exercise).3.a)҉ unrivaled multiplayer overlapping patterns of decisions may lead to unpartitioned critical routes of valid discernible intervention.Flooding is not the most severe, high impact/low frequency, naturally occurring hazard in this area though urban localized ‘flood-pools’ have been gaining press coverage. The deep-seated sliding Boconó fault system is a major NE-SW, right-lateral strike-slip tectonic feature at this location. The  stopdisastersgame.org in which each scenario takes between 10-20 minutes to play, depending on the disaster and player’s skill level, is known to be appropriate to address similar queries by laymen, including Civil Protection beginners and volunteer candidates to search and rescue organizations .Sources: Wikipedia, RiskHorizon, Course materials
