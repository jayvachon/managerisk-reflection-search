1.Risk management in the game was about investing initially limited resources in development that could sustain comet hits and subsequent flooding from waves. The choices I faced were how much to spend on building communities (pods), on upgrading life quality, on insurance, and on structural mitigation versus how bad the impact of a comet may be. The trade-offs were: 1) spending resource on protection when a threat was detected and forecasted to be oncoming instead of spending resource on upgrade, and 2) spending resource on upgrade while there were no threats on the horizon.2.i played several games. I learned early that I mustn't let development of pods slide in favor of spending most resource on protection. I also learned that one should buy insurance with maximum coverage as soon as possible, as it was a cheaper than to wait when more upgrades were made.3.If an advanced version is possible, I would add public opinion as a layer of complexity, that one would not gain as much resources if people feel unhappy with their level of development, and also add public awareness programs as a form of protection to improve the public's understanding for why it is necessary to invest in protection.4. Although there is no question on the game itself, I would like to say that the game is very interesting for me, and I congratulate the development team.
