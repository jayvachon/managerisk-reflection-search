The role of risk management in this game is to show that given scarce resources of financing we have to do the most of existing funding to built, maintain, repair and if possible develop land under the constant threat of flooding.During the game I tried to use most of the resources for development and when funding was insufficient for building I was using it for knowledge and insurance to the existing at that time level.Later on during the game I realized that money spent on knowledge had a great impact in the future development of the game because the risk was getting lower when there were no collisions or the outcome of the collisions was minimal.The preparation for risk through knowledge and insurance had a great impact on development because the damages were reduced and the available funds were increased so the could be used for upgrades of the development project.After a couple of tries of the game I realized I was not using the community help at all and therefore I could not get passed level 1. Community help decreases consequence of flooding and some times the negative outcome after a collision is minimal.When Istarted using it I was able to reach higher levels.The main things learned were:1. The more we spend on development, the more we need to spend on maintenance, insurance, upgrading therefore there should be an upper limit of how much land should be developped.2. Funding of a knowledge base may not seem to have immediate results but in the long run it greatly diminishes the outcome of future threats and therefore contributes to sustainable growth of development.3. Insurance is necessary to help repair future damages when they arise, but the level of coverage has to be considered in cooperation with community help and building of the knowledge base.4. Community help although not directly associated with available funding, helped minimize the outcome of collision when they happened.If I was to to propose some sort of improvement to the game I would add the possibility of lump sum funding from external sources (grants, donnations) that would be specifically used for risk management versus additionnal funding for new development.
