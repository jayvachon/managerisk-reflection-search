*Safety and economic development*
*Learning the difficult equilibrium from the game “Risk Horizon”*

As my fictitious country slid once again into a safe but stagnant economic depression, I began to reflect on the difficulty of finding equilibrium between the different elements of risk management.  The game “Risk Horizon” demonstrates the four aspects of risk management as described in the World Development Report 2014 Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development.  The four aspects are knowledge, insurance, protection and coping, which in the game have to be in balance with investment for economic development.  As I played the game, I bought full insurance, which seemed inexpensive in relation to its benefits.  I increased protection to the level of the highest threat, when it was possible to do so without undermining my economic growth.  As for knowledge, I prioritized the most dangerous of the meteorites.  What was difficult for me was finding the balance between protection and economic development.  In the short term, protection reduced the rate of economic development of my small country, but it allowed me to avoid the drastic costs of large scale disasters.  The second time I played, I tried to be a little less cautious, and although I advance further in the game, it turns out I still invested too much in protection and ended up failing.  The lesson I learnt was that taking too little risk was at the end a larger danger than the risks I had avoided, as I lost the opportunities to promote progress.  
 
I enjoyed the game, although if I could change one thing in the game, it would be the coping mechanism.  I believe that although coping is linked to knowledge of the threats, effective coping requires preparation before a disaster occurs, and that the game could reflect this with a series of activities such as organizing, awareness raising and planning that would make the coping activities more effective later.  The player would have to choose between using their time for gaining knowledge or for preparing the communities.

“Risk Horizon” allowed me to reflect on the diverse benefits of knowledge, insurance, protection and coping to risk management, and my failure led me recognize the lost opportunities that occur when we invest too much in risk reduction. I look forward to a more complex game in the future that includes, at least, a mechanism to prepare communities to be able to better cope in disaster situations.
