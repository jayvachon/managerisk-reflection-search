1. My roles in managing development is judging the trade off of spending time on research or protection as both of them are time consuming and can only do once at a time. Insurance is good when you know there is high chance of getting hit by a comet with higher damage than your protection. On the other hand, with lower than your protection comet, insurance is not good enough as it doesn't make up for production time lost in repairing. In short, protection and research are better options to spend resource on than insurance.2. I play it several times with each time I tried to specialize in one methods: either researching only or improving protection only or buying insurance only (spare resources were used to build). The conclusion is protection is the best option while insurance alone is the most ineffective.3. The proposal is a combination of researching about risk to match with adequate protection and buying insurance for severe damage risks only.
