The game  Risk Horizon is a very good strategy game to learn about risk management.By playing a role for developing a community in space which is frequently exposed to risk of comets collision Through  effectively managing risk  we can protect our community and keep its development going.The choices in the initial stages i have made includes spending money on protection as it is very important because in the game proper protection will all together save the community from getting effected.At the same time gathering knowledge about the comets are also important as it will give time form initial collision to improve the protection  I used to develop community as big as possible at the start of first level and the next thing I will s to give proper protection to the huts so that they will not be effected by comet strike.This will cost some money to acquire 4 point protection which could be spend to build or upgrade the hut's but the benefit comes when the risk materializes (when the comet strikes) we protect our hut with little or no damage so that there is no need to spend much on repairs and we can finish the task easily.but there are situations  in game where we will get too many comet strikes one after other in such situations insurance comes handy. It will help to recover form hit with low cost.so in long run risk management prevents the development from drooping and help's reaching the targets.                                                       I played the game more than once in the initial phases i used to develop only few huts and i used to develop remaining in the second level but this type of approach of slow development will not end-up in good results as game progress the later stages we will have higher targets and we can't reach them.then I corrected that mistake and started developing as much as possible in the initial stages as comet strikes will be less at that time.                                                        I used to buy higher insurance initially than giving adequate protection.Buying insurance will help us a lot at the time of the need but if we can get protection from the materializing risk in the first place then we can spend more money on protection than on insurance.but insurance is also required in later stages when there is a frequent comet attacks and repairs are costly.                                                    finally  If I develop the game then I will add and additional type of risk which will come suddenly and we don't have knowledge of it at all.so when such a risk is there which people will gain knowledge only through experience and can't protect them self's until they first face it then there will be a sense of uncertainty which is important component of risk and risk management.
