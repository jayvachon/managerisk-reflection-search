The main role of risk management in the game is to confront
risks (comets), prepare for them and cope with their effects in order to invest
in economic growth. In my opinion the game needed strategic planning to be
completed. Therefore, I have pursued a specific plan. When starting the game, I
have noticed that protection is the most important tool to have an effective
risk management and that protection and insurance depends on the knowledge we
have.In other words, I have increased the protection level and
bought a more expensive insurance only if I knew that the severity and the
probability to be hit by a comet is high. During the game I have confronted
only one trade-off: Balancing. To be successful in it, I have chosen to
constantly upgrade my pods to earn more money but at the same time I was highly
protecting my land, and buying moderate insurance. Because I came up with a
conclusion that if I have a high protection level, then I will not need an
expensive insurance to cover my losses, since comets will not or will rarely
hit my land. But on the contrary, if I buy the most expensive insurance and
don’t increase my protection, then comets will bomb the land and I will be
loosing a lot of money by repairing my pods.As far as I am concerned, in real life, preparation for risk
doesn’t show its positive result until a risk emerges. And that can sometimes
take years. Whereas in the game the preparation of risk affected development
immediately maybe because of the short time we had in each level.

 I have played the game several times to reach the 5th
level. What I have understood is  that spending more money on protection is more profitable rather than spending
an important amount on insurance. Moreover, I have noticed that when I reach
the next level, I am always broke. Thus, I have decided to save some money in the previous
level once the development is accomplished, so I can enter the next level with money.During the video talks I have gained a full understanding of
risk management but I have never implemented it in the real life. The game has
helped me to focus and think more about the importance of risk management in
our lives. And I am now convinced that the delay in development in some "countries in development" is due to the fact that they don’t spend enough time
on the implementation of risk management or they just try
to ignore the future. The most valuable think I have learned from this game is
how to choose the right balance by having the right strategic plan. At last,
the game has widened my knowledge about risk management and now I have an idea
how to implement an effective risk management in reality.

 If I could get the chance to adopt the Horizon game to
people living in my country, then I would like to add one thing: A Second Land.I am actually living in a war area where preparing and
coping with risk is certainly not enough for us to survive the daily shocks. At
this point, I would suggest adding a second land where we can build our pods
away from the war. The second land will not be available before the 4th
level; the player will immigrate when he or she cannot support the large number
of daily comets and will have the opportunity to move to the second land after having a full knowledge about the risks that can occur there.
