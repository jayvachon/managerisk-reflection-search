I was pleased with the game experience. It was both fun and educational.  I was impressed with the level of nuance built into the game, requiring considerable skill to balance the needs for knowledge, protection, and insurance in order to further development. The frustrations of losing the game were also a poignant reminder of the frustrations that many individuals and societies experience in real life. There is a lot of luck built into life, and it is important to beware of and take advantage of uncertainty in order to improve one’s life.1.  Risk management played a role in the game in two ways: 1) it was necessary for preparing for crises and then for coping afterward, in order to avoid a “poverty cycle,” resulting in loss of the game, and 2) it was necessary to take risks in order to develop opportunities and advance in the game.  Trade-offs were key to success, especially in light of changing circumstances.  For example, insurance was more important when an asteroid was certain to strike; and less important to buy near the end of a round.  More { knowledge, protection, or insurance } allowed for smarter choices among the other two aspects.  Preparation for risk affected development immediately by disallowing new structures to be built, which represents an immediate certain cost for a future uncertain benefit, similar to the political barriers faced by many risk management programs. Over time in the game, more risk preparation helped development by making shocks easier to bear and allow for more risks to be taken; however, too much risk preparation could starve development and still result in poverty and loss.2.  One adjustment I made in subsequent plays of the game was to buy more insurance.  Once I realized that losses in later rounds were quite severe (a 25% loss on a mature capital stock in later rounds is more costly to rebuild than a similar loss in an early round), it became useful to buy a higher level of insurance, especially at the beginning of a given round when there was more time left during which the insurance would be active. However, I learned that too much insurance can starve development and sometime be unnecessary, so that combining some protection with insurance is more ideal. I learned that a balance of risk management techniques is best.3.  The simple change I would propose would be to have insurance prices vary according to a) the amount of knowledge that I have or that is available, and b) the amount of protection I have.  In real life, the insurance market updates prices in real time to incorporate new information about incoming risks (like asteroids). And those purchasers with more protection may require less insurance (or be able to pay less for it) because they are less susceptible to damage.All in all, a very well designed game!  Thank you for the experience.
