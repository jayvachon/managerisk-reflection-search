Risk management in the game was important in the sense of
evaluating the impact and takes some measures as a conclusion of the assessment
of the risk even if that means to prepare for the impact or to ignore the
impact and take the opportunity to continue to construct (develop). Depending
on the situation and of potential damage that was estimate during the research
of the comet the game learn you how to play with measures even
in the real life, because in function of the situation you could take measures
in terms of knowledge an protection, or protection and insurance or knowledge
and insurance, and so on. Because preparation for risk has an immediate impact on the
budget then the development is affected immediately then if for example we
don’t take any preparation for a risk.

 

First time when I played the game I was focused in prepare
for the risk, and I didn’t pay attention to development, and in level 3 when
the treats are multiple I’ve failed to touch my objective which was the
development. Then in second attempt I’ve tried to keep in balance the
assessment of risk and the development with my main focus oriented on
development. So, what I’ve learned from the game is that you have to keep a
balance between assessment of the risk and development. If you are focused on
risk too much you could loose yourself in preparation for risk and forget about
your goal.

 

I think that in order of understand better the risk
management it should be more obvious what are the opportunities, because risk
doesn’t mean only treats (and thoes are very well represented here by the comets
which you could translate in any kind of real treats from natural disaster to politics
or economic ones). Should be more obvious related to opportunities how to evaluate them,
how to catch them, how to accelerate the apparition of opportunities.
