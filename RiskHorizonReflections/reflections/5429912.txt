This game is an extremely useful example for understanding how risk management is applied in a small scale.Our goal was to deal with the phenomenon of falling comets, which is a systemic risk.First of all, we can perceive the whole game as a process of effective risk management.It would be impossible to reach high levels without taking useful tips from the tutorial.This is the very first trace of the ''knowledge'' component of risk chain.Our goal was to reach level 6 by building and  upgrading pods simultaneously. As far as the game is concerned, I had to follow the exact same strategy as I am currently learning in this course.Observing comets was a key to success.It was a time-consuming process but the longer I observed a comet, the more accurate my predictions were.I had to know about the severity of comets and their possibility of falling and causing waves.Moreover,I had to invest money  in raising the village above the ground in order to protect it from harmful waves, of which I had the knowledge that they will possibly hit us. If our preparation for protection was deemed inadequate to save the village from the waves, I had to perchase some insurance in order to mitigate the costs of the damage.All this process was a slight obstacle for development, because I had to spend a lot of money and time in order to take all these precautionary measures.Finally, I believe that balancing development with protection is a key to success not only in this game but also in a realistic systemic risk.I played the game more than once  in order to come to the above conclusion. I gained significant experience from this simulation because I understood the importance of following the steps to confront a risk.At my first try, I did not concentrate on both developmet and protection.This was the reason why I reached level 3.At my next try , I tried to follow a more balanced strategy.Developing my village, while observing the comets and raising the ground, lead me to reach level 6. A very useful lesson I learned from this game, was to spend more time on understanding the shocks and reducing the size of losses than on trying to buy an insurance without doing all the appropriate personal preparation for a risk.To conclude with, I would put behavioral obstacles as the luck factor because I think behavioral biases and stability are very important aspects of managing risks successfully and efficiently, if I could make a change in this game.
