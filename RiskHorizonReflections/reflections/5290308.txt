The risk is to prevent the pods from damaging from the comets. I choose to spend more on insurance, protection than I expected. If I spend more on insurance and protection, it will be less for the development for the pods, and vise versa. I paid too little at the first chance. I knew that I need to be aware of the risks, and risks are uncertainties. Risk management is like an art of choices.
