the game is like a business. some risk events occur and often we know them but some are fast and some slow. we can ignore some because of the damage is not large but for some we can not and should use insurance. by play the game more and more, i can learn patience like chess and pay money for growing the business and buy insurance only when i need it.i suggest in the new version, it is better we can do some tasks to change the risk events for example by changing strategy, we can transfer some damage from event 1 to the 2 or make 1 slower by increasing the speed of 2.
