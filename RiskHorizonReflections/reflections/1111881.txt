I failed the game twice after playing it 4 times, 2 of each
for both levels. The second time I played level one, I spent more on research,
which saved me from huge losses after the shocks. Each time I played, I spent
huge amount buying insurance. Sometimes it helped but other times it didn’t. Something I learned from the game is that doing research and
repairing quickly on risk management are important. I don’t quite see the power
of knowledge here because the shocks are pretty much un-preventable. I feel that
building at the right time to avoid huge chances of getting hit is helpful but
it’s totally out of my control.  To sum up, the role of risk management in the game is to set
up prevention, coping and rescue mechanisms so that we can minimize losses. The
second and third time I played the game, I invested more on research and
insurance. As a result, it cost me more but reduced the damage. Preparation happened
immediately the shocks worked more effectively.  When I played the game the second time, I tried to build
less pods but updated them more frequently. Because the bigger the community
is, the more money and much longer time it costs to repair.  
































My new design of the game would be to add a function with
which I can evacuate (or move) the pods. If I can, I’d also like to add a
function with which I decide whether to repair the pods or to tear it down and
build a new one.
