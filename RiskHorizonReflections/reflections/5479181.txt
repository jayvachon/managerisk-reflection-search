Risk management was the essence of the game. The key strategy is to sustain development while managing the risk due to external calamities like the comets here. The risk management is done by taking into account different factors like protection, research done on the subject, insurance against damage due to the calamity.The game was a simulation of real life scenarios where adequate research will help avenge the damage due to the calamity, which is the key takeaway from the game.I played the game once to reach to the desired level. I focused on the overall development of the bots to ensure development as well as keeping my focus on taking care of the obstacles by increasing protection and adequately researching on the obstacle. If given a second chance I would focus more on increasing the protection to help increase my resistance to defense.The disaster management community help feature could have been bettered to include the most hit plots only.Â
