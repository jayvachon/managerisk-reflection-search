Reflection of the the Risk Horizon GameThe goal of the risk management in the game was to build a resilient
community and promotion of sustainable development. In the game to attain this
broader goal of the development, it was necessary to monitor the risks or
threat on a regular basis to know the magnitude of vulnerability. To avoid or minimize
the risks, protection like, employment or economic development, raising the
community areas, and obtaining insurance are necessary. This means, it has
considered that development will face risk but we can manage our development in
a way that it would be sustainable and risk will be averted or mitigated if
right strategy of risk management initiated. Besides, regular risk monitoring
(research) is a key pre-requisite to know about the risk and its magnitude and
it helps a lot to communicate about the risk which help to comforting better.     



I tried to concentrate on risk monitoring (research) and
accordingly I played the game and promoted ad equitable development so that
economic opportunity is sustained and all members are getting equal access to
development.            



I will add how multiple options can be done at once. Because risk
management and development is a simultaneous process and all community members
are needed to work together. Therefore multiple options/task needed to perform
at once.
