In the game, risk management makes it less likely to be hit by a disaster, and made the negative consequences of disasters less severe. I made the choice to invest early in insurance, then in knowledge and finally in protection, which means that I made a trade-off in between those various sorts of risk management approaches. Preparation for risk affected development insofar as it slows down development in terms of the time one can devote to it and the money available to development.I played the game several times. After the first time, I invested more in risk management. What I learned from the game is that being willing and prepared to invest in risk management, and prioritizing such investments is necessary but not enough - much is still left to chance. For example, if one is hit by a disaster just before the time of the level is up, then one can't really win the level because there is insufficient time after the disaster to repair, and this is the case even if investments in risk management has been maximal.If I was tasked to develop a new version of the game, I would add the political dimension of risk management - it is frequently politically expensive for elected officials to invest in long term risk management, while election cycles are typically short.
