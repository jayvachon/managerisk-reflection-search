The risk management helped in preventing damage to pods,and if there was any damage then insurance recovered all those damages.At first i was focusing more on building pods, but then i stopped and started gaining knowledge of the comet and simultaneously increased protection and bought insurance. When preparation was more for risk, cost incurred after damage was less.I played the game for more than once,in the beginning i bought expensive insurance policy which reduced my resources and i was not able to complete the level.Then from next attempt i built pods and then learned about severity of comets and chances of hit, based on that i bought the insurance and raised protection.In the meanwhile i learnt that not only building pods, and insurance helps in fighting risk but developing community and upgrading the current protection helps to stand in tougher and riskier situations.No doubt we sometimes fail in lack of resources but this does not happen all the time. We have to keep resources anticipating for future uncertainty.According to my place,where there is possibility of terrorist attack,there is a threat to common man's life , i would add more resource and protection element in the game, in the lack of resources the government is not able to stop such incidences and risk to life is increasing day by day. Everyone has knowledge about risk but resources hold back the hands ,hence susceptibility of life has increased.Â
