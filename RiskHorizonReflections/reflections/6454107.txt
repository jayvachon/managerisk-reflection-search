I couldn't get the game for the first time. Every preparation for risk except insurance worked after a while and indeed affect development in high extent. The higher level of development the longer time to recover somehow after shocks.Playing for the first time I tried to built the pods as fast as I could and as much as possibile, but it turned out that due to high risk of shock it wasn't the best strategy. Then I tried built few pods first, develop them enhanced them and if there were no much shocks around for some time I tried to built a few more. Meanwhile I invested some money for protection which of course slowed down development overall, however the damage after every shock was smaller.I had no infulence to comets itself I could only observe them and based on information and especially on 'chance of hit information I could adjust my development depend on risk whether is high or low but even this wasn't a good source to trust. After all it turned out that the most important was first eliminate the risk and mitigate it to the lowest level and then development speeds up. On the other hand I couldn't completely restrain the development the village had to thrive.In my place where I live the risk of natural distater is rather low, there are some other risks like financial crisis which affected us all in some extent. Nevertheless the biggest issue and obstacle to development is rooted somewhere deep the fear of failure and complexes. We are also not taught to insure ourselves or families or housholds. I would recommend to learn and teach how to become and be more resilient person itself. We have all needed and required resources to do so but education has gone in some different direction.
