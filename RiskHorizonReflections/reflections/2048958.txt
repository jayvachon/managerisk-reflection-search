Risk Management has been a very essential entity for the progress of the community. This is what the game symbolizes and makes us realize the importance of the Risk management. Development  for a nation or an entity needs research which in turn is dependent on technology which also is based on the resources. A developing nation or community cannot plan to focus on research avenues available for development mainly because of high investments. After surpassing the initial stage, resources can be utilized and invested in research avenues. On the whole, the game paid importance to between the growth in development percentage and the level of the ground barrier to be made. Also the research was essential for the community development and overcome the losses occurred during the period. The more time spent on each , the more data gets gathered. Planning and preparation towards research enables the community to showcase better communication and quicker rehabilitation. An arena which needs to be developed, also needs better communication network. For example Disaster Management Devices need to be used in disaster prone areas to save humanity and life stock. A better insurance needed to cope up with losses and essential for minimum investment. Insurance provides a better outlook and more opportunities for development. An insured person can do more work and utilize better resources in better manner. A real truth is that shows that time and resources utilized. That resulted in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I kept some resources for research and preparedness also. Most important, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community.
