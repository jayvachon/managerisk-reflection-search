The game stresses the necessity of taking into account all the basic components of the risk management process in order to avoid numerous negative consequences which may hapen to be destructive. The various aspects of risk management, which plays the role of the basis for saving the results of the previos work and efforts taken to achieve a specified aim, should be regarded in a system. It is crucial, for example, to evaluate how much effirt should be devoted to the accumulation of knowledge and to research activity in order to understand and evaluate the possibility of danger and the probability of destructive consequences of a certain kind. The game also stresses the importance of insurance as a crucial element in risk management. the trade-off between the increase in the level of protection and nsurance is however not that easy to find. Development is affected by preparation to risk not immediately, but after a certain eriod of time in future.I personally played the game more than once and learned a lot form the very first efforts. For instance, I understood the importance to invest more time and money into research. This was what I chaged in the consequtive efforts.If I were to introduce changes into the game I would try to make the situations more variable trying to illustrate different types of risky situations. One more idea to think of to improve the game would be to introduce the human behaviour factor into the risk mangement process in the form of illustrations that people do not always behave in the way they are expected to do when they have the knowledge.
