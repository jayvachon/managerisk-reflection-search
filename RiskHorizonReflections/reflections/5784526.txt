Playing the game has not only been a great learning
experience, but it has also enabled me to be confronted to keys obstacles to
risk management.

In fact, the cash offered to build the development community has been a welcome incentive that induces you to take more risks of upgrading and
building as much pods as you could. 
However, the lack of information on how to prevent comets hitting the pods or to better
protect the development community from such a devastating natural disaster has
been a great challenge to overcome during the game.  Moreover, the warning system in place was not
sufficient to limit the damage.  Although I could purchase insurance to mitigate the damage of the development
community when the comet hits, but the time constraint to upgrade the pods, the
availability of financial resource and the shock created by the damage gave me
no chance to recover.

I have played the game several times hoping to advance to
level 3 with no avail, just to realize that my failure has to do with the fact
that at some point of the game I became overconfident.  For example, I wanted to build more pods with
limited insurance. As the result, the cost of paying for damage on the pods, exceeded
the benefits of paying the insurance in advance.  

Due to the uncertainty of risks that the comet hitting our development community might cause, one should always  “combine the capacity to prepare and
caring in advance and the ability to cope afterward” as the World Development Report 2014  has well
stated.
