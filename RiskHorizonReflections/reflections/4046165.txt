1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?The game was about the importance of Risk Management in the development of Alora. The community is exposed to potential socks (comets that might hit the water and cause waves) that would suppress development. Just as in the real world, each nation should inevitably confront potential shocks (idiosyncratic or systemic).The role of Risk Management is clearly seen in the game. A balance should be determined between developing the community and preparing for the potential shocks, given a specific set of tools (research, protection, and insurance) and resources. This balance would mean that to obtain one, another should be forgone. I was made to choose whether to utilize all my resources in building/ upgrading pods, spend time on research to acquire knowledge, invest on protection, or invest in insurance. I chose to develop the community progressively, building up a few pods from the start, sacrificing income and investing on protection/ insurance (if the situation permits) at the same time.Preparation for risk affect development immediately during the start of the game. This helped cushion the potential shock caused by the comets. However, during the succeeding levels, I just need to augment my protection with insurance to absorb the damages caused by the comets.2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?I made several tries of the game, hoping to beat Level 4 and reach Level 5. I got the hang of it and I did reach the latter. Of course, this entailed changes in strategy in order to move to the higher level. The following is a summary of my choice of strategy: At the start of the game, during the establishment of the community, instead of using all my resources to erect pods and fill all the spaces quickly, I chose to limit my structures (the trade-off would be the fast income generation due to a great number of pods at the start), progressively upgrading them one by one and successively filling the spaces; constantly keeping in mind to increase my protection, research, and buy insurance if the situation permits. This was no easy task since choosing one would mean foregoing an alternative that could bring about an increase in development/ milestones.I learned that while the desire for improvement is strong, the changes needed to bring improvement can entail substantial risk. However, the reluctance to take risk would be more costly in the end. Risk management can help manage the potential downside from taking risk. 3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?Personally, instead of comets, I would propose typhoons affecting the agricultural lands and flooding coastal towns in the Philippines.
