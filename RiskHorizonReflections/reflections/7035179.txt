Reflection On the Risk Horizon Game :The Game Risk Horison is a well designed Strategy Game meant to realise the importance of Risk management in Different Circumstances. The clear goal of the game was to put emphaisis on the prevention of the risk if its minimal or to mitigate it in the best possible way keeping pace with constant development . To do that we had to make clear choices with the resources and fund avaliable to confroant in knowledge, protection and insurance. The Game shows that a constant balance of focus and Investment in either knowledge , Protection or insurance  is to be maintained all the time while looking foreward to the development of the society in whole , also that with time the Risks tend to be more alarming and they are in increased frequency. ( as in thre game with increasing levels).In Alora the prime task was Development of the society : Building pods and upgrading them will increase the Development bar.but the Risk here is falling comets which are of Different Chances of hitting as well as the different damage capacity ( knowledge of the Risk is very important as it helps in fighting them) and if they hit can cause damage as well as hinder Development(reduction in the development bar) .here, being an Luminator we have to balance our resources in three powers given as Research; to know the comets and damage capacity ( to know about the risk) , Protection ; to protect  from the waves by raising the island ( risk mitigation process) and third is Insurance ; cheaper repairs of the pods if comet hits (The Cost Reduction in rebuilding of the society in case of damage).                 These powers if not used in time or improperly used then there can a shortage of funds for other requirements that follow..eg. if We used all resources in Developing pods then we have no resources to protect them and neither for insurance .    also if we used up all resources in Mitigating risk , protection or insurance then the development would be slowed and hindered.So as the game progresses the task of keeping up the process of Development with increased risks can be achieved by proper resource allocation and creating a balance between the three powers given to us used sustainably at proper time.(This is exactly what needs to be done i.e proper prior planning and efficient implementation when fighting a Risk in real society.)
