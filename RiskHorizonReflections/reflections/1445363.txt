The whole
game is around risk management. In order to survive and achieve development you
have always to choose among several options. It was really hard to choose
between knowledge, protection and insurance. For what I saw, preparation for
risk diminished the damages significantly, but their costs in terms of money
and time would likely prevent you yo achieves the goals of development. I
noticed to that premature development could also be detrimental in the long
run, because more developed structures were always more expensive to repair.

It took me
a couple of tries to capture the essentials of the game. After my first attempt
I started to pay more attention to the external protection. I also expected
just before some imminent impact to buy some insurance. 

I did have
a couple of suggestions to improve the game. First I think that the revenue
should increase as you improve the structures. In the real world the
improvements in an area usually produce an increase in the welfare and the production
of that area. Another thing that I would change is the observation velocity. As
you achieve development, the study of the comets should go slightly but
increasingly faster. 

Overall, I
had a good time playing the game, and I think that it’s a great tool to teach
some basics about Risk Management.
