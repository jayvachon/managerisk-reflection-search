the role of risk management in this game was knowledge. i was confronted with not having enough understanding of how to protect my place, after a couple of tries then it became clear to me that i need to protect by insuring my place after my first build. then implement the knowledge of developing a property at a time, which made complete sense  because when the comet drops the damage was less and it was insured by the insurance company which mad it easier to repair and less costly. In this game if i had to recreate it id implement more time, even though that situations comes without warning sometimes some places and people need more time.Also i would add more ways to protect the place. at first this game had me confused i almost give up until i realize i was trying to build all my properties at once and hoping for rise in money then to protect. but the team of knowledge, protection and insurance was the key to maintaining and passing level 1
