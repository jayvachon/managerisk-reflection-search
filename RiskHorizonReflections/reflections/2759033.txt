I found the
game a little confusing at the beginning. Did not quite understand where the
rule of managing risks in a situation such as the game. I'm more accustomed to
direct discussions about the real problems in our world, such as economic
crises, natural disasters, in short, all the sudden changes that cause negative
shocks across countries. 

 I had some
difficulty coordinating set tools by clicking on the comets to increase my
level of research, and the protection and safety measures that were available
to ensure the sustainability of the planet.Comments on the oil sector in BrazilIn general, the government of underdeveloped or developing countries,
as is the case of Brazil, has a strong
presence in "key"
sectors of the economy, such as the oil industry in order to make with its economic policies act by these companies.The freezing of prices of
petrol and diesel Petrobras made
by order of President
Dilma Rousseff, had
the objective of contain inflation, which is a consequence of the increase in prices of petrol and diesel in the international market. We can say that the higher consumption of oil and its derivatives in emerging economies (such as China, India, Brazil
and others) and developed countries are
responsible for this.We can also observe that after
the financial crisis of 2008-2009, many countries adopted expansionary
fiscal and monetary policies with
the objective of heating demand
and avoid recession, among these
countries include Brazil, the United States and others. The automobile sector in Brazil, along with several other sectors, has obtained an
incentive to reduce taxes.Another point that we should note, was the explosive growth of the middle class in Brazil,
which boosted demand for both gasoline, diesel and other petroleum derivatives that are present in our entire economy.Petrobras has greatly increased the level of investment in exploration and production, yet in President Lula. In
2006 arrived at achieve self-sufficiency in oil from Brazil, but this victory was subsequently suppressed by the strong
growth in oil demand, a
consequence of the growing middle
class in Brazil which was also favored
by government policies of the Lula government.With the discovery of pre-salt basin
between 2006-2007, a great expectation arose from the federal government, by the size of oil reserves (about
12 billion barrels of oil), and the complexity of oil extraction in high depth (about
8,000 m below of the sea), a fact
which undoubtedly increases the cost and
time of production in these
regions, but did not appear as
an impossible challenge, since Petrobras
is a world leader in deep water exploration.The company has been conducting a
high level of investment to
accelerate oil production in
these regions, but there is a
period of time for the investments
to start give "visible fruits" in our economy.While oil demand is not fully supplied by
Petrobras with the increased
production of the pre-salt
basin, the government, through Petrobras, imported part of petrol and diesel in the international market at a higher price, and transferred
in the internal market to a lower price with
the objective of  contain inflation,
making an impoundment of market prices, until the growth
of production in pre-salt basin can supply all
the demand in the country.I believe that with the growth of production in pre-salt basin,
and subsequently, self sufficiency in oil in the Brazil, the Brazilian economy will be less vulnerable to price fluctuation caused by the import of
gasoline and diesel.I also believe that the presence of the government in this sector will be crucial for the establishment
of a stable economy, with economic growth and the use of the profits of
oil royalties being used in sectors like education, health and others. 
But still, the new
investments in renewable energy sources
should always continue in order to obtain energy
alternatives that will reduce in
the long-term high demand for oil
in the world.
