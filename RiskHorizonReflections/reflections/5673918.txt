The role of Risk management in the game was in building and making it sustainable throughout the time. Floods and meteors are constantly coming so you have to defense yourself and keep building your community. I found that insurance is most important and I immediately bought insurance level 3, that will protect me in case of emergency. After that against floods I kept fighting during the whole game. Regarding the meteors it was the most chalengable, because it took some time to do research and therefore I didn't have time to complete community.I have played the game numerous times and I have reached Level 3. If I played the game only once I would immediately focus on insurance and building community. Main things that I learned are the complexity of every project and in order to succeed you have to pay attention to a lot of things.Â If I have been tasked to develop a new version of the game I would try to reshape the research factor, because it seems a little bit complex. Some other form of research and some other form of battle against meteors would be nice. Perhaps to divide that two things and make them separate. That would increase the speed of development of the community and would be more clearly who does what.
