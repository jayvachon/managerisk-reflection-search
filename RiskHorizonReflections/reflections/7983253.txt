The role o risk management on the game was crucial as the every thing comes out of shock, the negative shock. Knowledge, insurance and protection was also important during the risk management. between the three,i saw knowledge as more important as it channels the its impact to protection and the insurance package and how to trade between the protection and coping.Also knowledge through research reduces the impact of the shock. Chance of hit is not always 100% as the risk might me higher at first but as time comes the possibility of hitting decrease but it is not the reason to stop protection. However, protection is very cost full and undermines development but the more protection gives back the damages which might be done in the future without re investing again. Also as you invest in protection of higher risk when the information from the research is highly sufficient, it reduces the damages of higher risk in front  and other small upcoming risks with similar features. It is like killing more than one birds by a one stone. I played the game more than once, and each time i played i learn new tactics. First i learn the important of time during in the whole process. Hurrying for development in higher risk environment is not a good option. I also came to learn that building community cooperation is important as it reduces the stress of the shock and help during in coping with the shock effect. However, both expanding the community and improving the styles and benefits is important but it depends on the levels of the community. In developing community more important is to spread the community and improve the cooperation among them. In developed community the styles and building higher is essential and there should be higher insurances for such community.The setting of the game is good and represent many aspects in the community building. If i have a chance to develop next version of the game i will decentralize the setting to more social elements such as roads, market places, schools, and other social infrastructures. However, i will increase the reality of the community shocks such as floods, unemployments, political criss and change of the technology. Also the player will have the option to choose his position as the character. For instance a policy maker, local citizen or a business owner. The other setting of the current version will remain the same.
