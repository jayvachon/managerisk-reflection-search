My Reflections about Risk Horizon gameRisk Horizon is
an online game which can be played on Pc with a simple web browser. The
Creators made this Game in order to illustrate the basic mechanism of risk
management.In the game the
player is a governor of a small city which is located on a planet and he’s main
quest is to save the city from natural disasters (In this case this disaster is
an asteroid which can hit the surface and if that happened the nearby river can
flood the city and hurt the buildings) and increase the city’s economy.The player cannot do both, because of
limited resources, so the player must choose.To save the city the player can investigate
the asteroids (which do not have a direct impact on economy) which do not cost
any money, but it take time, so if you scan the object you cannot do anything.
You can also build Protection (Which reduce growing immediately), but this is
not cheap, so you cannot buy or improve pods. Thirdly, you can use some
insurance, but this is not prevent any crises, it cost a lot of money, you have
to spend a lot of time to rebuild your pods and the insurance does not fulfill
the whole cost, so it has an impact on your economy when you buy the insurance
and when the disaster happen and you have to rebuild your economy.            I
have played the game for several times. The first attempt was not a long run,
because I did not understand the main mechanism of the game and because of that
I did not spend time with scanning and the impact of the asteroids were
especially huge. The second and the third run was far better than the first and
I have reached the maximum point for two times and I believe that the best
tactic for risk management in this game to avoid insurance at any cost.I think that if you spend money to prevent
these problems by improving protections and collecting knowledge then the
actual risk of a natural disaster is relatively low and in this case you still
have money to improve your pods, so your economy will work. I do not say that
insurance is useless, but if you play this game as I did than you should act
like me.I believe the most important thing I have
learned from this game is that everything has a price and you must know that no
matter how hard you fight against something there will be sacrifices and the
only think you can do is to lower it’ effect as low as possible.           First
of all, if I can make some improvements for this game then I would make a
mobile app for this game, because it’s much easier to access to a game through
smart phones and if we do that then more people will understand the importance
of risk management.Secondly, we all know that If there is
place which is threatened by natural disasters for a long time then the effect
of a disaster is the highest when its happened for the first time, because
after the first crisis most of the people will know how should they act in a situation
like this.I know that if we introduce this function then
this game will be easier and easier every turn, so if we want to prevent this then
we should introduce more types of natural disaster.I have
written down my opinion about this browser based game and I hope all of you have enjoyed my reading
