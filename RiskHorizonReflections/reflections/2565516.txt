The game captured four aspect of risk management, the fourth aspect being resources. I would like to elaborate, you need the backing of resources for all three steps of risk management:1. Knowledge accumulation is needed to predict the timing and consequences of the risk more accurately. Knowledge accumulation need time, and other resource expense including monetary2. Protection is needed to avoid or reduce the loss that could happen in case the risk materialize. But one should know how much protection to provide, less than required protection, in case of risk event the loss will be significant but if you take more than required protection, though in case of risk event materializing you wouldn't face any loss but you have already faced losses3. Insurance. One need to know the possibility of the risk and the potential losses in case the risk materializes. These two information you would decide how much of insurance you would need or if you want to take the insurance at all.As we have seen in the game too that in order to protect oneself against the risks, you would be spending your resources and hence it would slow down your development to start off. But since you have spent in managing the potential risk, at time when the risk materializes your losses would be much lower or in other words your development will be hampered by a smaller quantum. Or in other words, in longer term because of the risk mitigation your growth will be much better.I played the game twice, and in my second chance I didn't over spent my resources in protection. I spent minimum what was needed on protection, and spent much more time on research. This gave me much better picture on the possibility of the comet hitting and the devastation it will create. It helped me to decide at each level how much insurance I should take. Also in case of a hit it gave me more time to manage the colony.
