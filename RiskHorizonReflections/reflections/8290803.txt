Risk management plays a vital role in the game. I read How to play carefully, looked out for what will happen, react immediately. I tried to build as many pods as I can and do not focus on the risk. Than, I realized that protection is useful (but It can get expensive).If I played the game only once, I would pay more attention to How to play, learned from classmates' experience. The main things I learned from the game is everyone should be ready for take the risk, we should better save money for some serious situations, so we can use it to buy proper insurance package.I wish my pods could be moved to avoid the damage in a new version of the game. The position to build up the pods can be not the good one. This change make a better present the risk management choices that matter in my life.
