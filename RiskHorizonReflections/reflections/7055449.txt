As it was presented in the game, the role of risk management is huge. If a person knows more about the danger, it allows to make more reasonable decisions about protection and insurance.  It allows to develop settlement and infrastructure more effectively and rapidly. Speaking about preparation for risk, it affects not immediately, but always after some time, but effective risk management allows spending less money in long-term perspective.Playing a game more than once allows to implement different strategies to choose the most effective one. It was told in lectures but the game allows to feel in more or less "real life" how knowledge, protection and insurance affect each other and searching for ideal proportion between them.Speaking about developing the game, I would suggest different ways to make it better:1. If a person fails on some level, option to start with the same level, not from the beginning2.  Option to research, protect and develop settlement in the same time3. Different options of protection from meteors4. When a pod is damaged, but upgraded, turn it to previos level of upgrade, but not repairing it.5. Explain the meaning of the graphs when settlement is damaged from meteors.
