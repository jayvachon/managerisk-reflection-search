1) The role of risk management in the game was saving the projects and maximising the wealth and saving life.The knowledge has a direct relation to the time we had at the time of disaster. Certain things cannot be insured. Protection requires lot of resources and also time. Striking a balance between these three was a challenge.2) I have played the tutorial version multiple times before actually playing the game. I have played the game more than once but could not succeed. Both the times I played differently. i.e, First time i was taking maximum risk and invested minimum in the research. In the second time and third time I invested Insurane and protection respectively. But still I could not succeed. I feel the balance should be striked between all the three.Â 3) I feel the protection i.e, the elevation part the consumption of resources for elevating the island is consuming the disproportionate amount which can be revisited. Further one aspect which I feel to add with respect to my local area is floods and drought condition may also be added to the game.
