This game was about development in the the time of uncertainty. Development of a settlement was challenging because of constant threats from the meteorites and damages they cause through I assume floods and earthquakes. The game is in line with the real world, where development of societies in hindered by natural disasters. It reminds me of an example given in one of the videos of week 2, where speaker talks about Mumbai and constant floods and also mentions Haiti earthquake. Our role in this game was to become "Chile", to make development possible even when the disaster strikes. This could have been achieved through buying insurance or raising the ground of the settlement as a way of protection. In my opinion, research we had to conduct about the meteorites was also the way of protection because it enabled us to better know our threat and prepare for coping with it. To achieve that we had make certain trade-offs. Most notable ones are tradeoffs in resources, where to allocate them, and in time, how to use it. When it comes to resources, we could have build or protect ourselves. The tradeoffs I made were based on the information I got from the research of meteorites. Depending on their severity and a change of impact I made a decisions either to buy an insurance or to protect the settlement. Here I noted that in case of great severity of the damage meteorite will cause and in times when this impact was certain, the best way to protect yourself was to build a protection. However, this approach took me time and resources I could have spent on a development. That is why in my second attempt I tried to balance between protection and an insurance, in a way that I was trying to get protected just enough to stay safe from the mediocre dangers that will cause me small damages, which are easy to repair and will not take a lot of time to repair. But, at the end I did make a mistake, where I allowed too much of damage that took me a lot of time and resources to cope with, and eventually cost me progress to finishing the game. To summarise my finding, I learned that investing too much on a protection and insurance will cost me a lot in terms of development, but not investing at all would not allow development to occur at all. The right approach would be to find a resource and time balance between protection/insurance and development, and that could be achieved only with the right amount of knowledge. The game actually did show this value of knowledge through this game of connection of green dots after the impact, and it proved that more research leads to better protection.In conclusion, this game shows the challenges people face in a real life and is a offers a good basis for understanding risk management that will lead to opportunities. I believe that this game could improve if developers would add unexpected events in a way of a third party help in terms of resources, or the event that might also slow down our development. This would better simulate the real world, where this unexpected events do occur and are usually very significant. Good examples would be change of political parties or sudden donations/help from let say Red Cross or United Nations.
