1.Due to poor internet connection, I could go only till
level 2 of the game. Not much to understand the game fully. Though I think that
the role of risk management in the game was to protect the pods from damage
from the falling comets without spending much. I spent more on building pods
and bought insurance. Preparing to overcome risk affects development as you are
using up some of your resources for backup when risk strikes. You may not be
able to use all your resources for development.

2.If I were to play the game again, I would keep the
instructions simple and easy and give an idea on how to play the game.
Tutorials were not clear. On my second attempt, I spent more on building pods
and upgrading them and bought an insurance but did not have any idea how to use
it! From the game I learnt that we should try to keep balance between risk
management and development. Spending too much in risk management will hamper
development as resources will be used up and vice versa. Both should go hand in
hand for better stability in life. 

3.Current assessment by various organization shows that
Nepal is vulnerable to earthquake and health risks. A major earthquake in the
 capital may result in the deaths of many
 people, hundreds of thousands injured
and close to 1 million displaced. Risk management may include building
earthquake resilience building through retrofitting, training, awareness
raising and safety measures that ensure these buildings are operational even after
a major disaster. Health risks can be better managed through awareness and
spreading knowledge with availability of necessary medicines in the remote
areas.
