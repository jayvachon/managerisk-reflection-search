1-The role of the risk management in the game was to give a importance to what you already achieve and try to kept it facing the comete falls. In each case u study the risk, the possibilty of hitting your buildings and try to cope with, made decision such: if the risk is not very high and you haven't enough solde you can let it hit yours and then the damage will be reperable easily, also you can buy an insurance to amortize the effects. The preparation for risk affects development after a time.2- After the first time playing (losing at first level :) ), I made a short concertation with my self: I must made an insurance for the buildings, I must let some solde used as prevention for  the next comete hit. Playing this game teach us that we are always fronted to a risk, and we must always keep it inti consideration by preparing for it: making insurance, studying the degree of risk and make decision to continue or changing the way of playing, which component of the game is to be used in a specific time of the game.3- Other type of risk could be added that influence also the insurance, it may be ana insurance that can be affected with a risk of losing it.
