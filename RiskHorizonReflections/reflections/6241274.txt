Manelisi Klaas's reflections from the Horizon gameThe role of risk management in the game was to ensure that all risk avenues for the ponds that had to built were secured, insured and properly built for coping mechanisms.  I had to make choices based on the budget funds I had for all the risk management activities which had to be done, such as, research of the past natural disasters and forecasts of future natural disasters.  All that information was then a starting point of knowledge we needed, on how and where ponds had to be built.  Among other things, after the structures where built, we then had to ensure them, to ensure that they were protected and a back up plan was setup.Upgrades were made on the pond structures and, land surface that they were built on was also worked on to ensure coping and effective risk management mechanism leading to prosperity after disaster.  Having insurance for the ponds affected development immediately after the comets strikes earth and caused a disaster. Houses were managed to be built at a low cost, due to the insurance doing the work. I played the game a couple of times and unfortunately I could not finish the levels because, I took the game for granted while I had to imagine a real life situation.  It appeared to me that more research on how to protect my pond town had to be made.  With limited funds, different types of options to be taken from the insurance companies, I had to strategise to aim at reaching my goals in a more effective and efficient way.  I also learned that the more the community was increased the better the funds were.  That was a confirmation of one of the video lectures, which mentioned sharing of responsibility in risk management.  I did not think I was going to survive the levels of the game played without having as much community members as possible.  The game design itself made it difficult for one to pass one level to another without having a full community.I would imagine in the future I would like a game that has more clear graphics in terms of the set up of the land surface where the ponds must be built, with a clear view, when conducting a research on where the comet roughly could hit the earth, something like being granted a telescope for looking at the sky and a timer.  At least if there is a feature such as research, then I would expect after paying my funds to have access to that equipment and other things I need to access information for.  The funds provided for building ponds and insuring them at the beginning of the game, maybe players can be offered sufficient funding, and then, design the game with strenuous avenues and tactics the player need to discover for his budget to increase afterwards.  The insurance purchased should give outlined costs of the upgrades should a disaster occur and ponds are damaged severely or partially.Upgrades to the ponds and the vicinity should include interesting materials, such brick fencing, steel poles and other infrastructure materials that would give confidence if you build with them then, you are much more protected than having a pond on the field. These would include roughly, in the case where the comet hitting the earth may push sea water to the ponds to drown the community, having proper drainage systems, to remove the water from the settlement. All in all the game scenario was a good skill practize for risk management and coping mechanisms.
