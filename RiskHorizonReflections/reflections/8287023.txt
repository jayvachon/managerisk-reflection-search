Risk management is quite important in this game. You need to balance
your research, protection and insurance. Research plays an important role which
helps you to access the severity and the chance that the comets hit and damage
your pods, then you will decide whether you need to either increase the
protection level or buy insurance to mitigate the risks. I normally chose to increase
the protection level first before taking the insurance. I did not pay much attention to research work in my first time play so I
wasted the resources of protection and insurance for the comets which had only
small chance of hitting my pods or the severity level is very low. From the second
time, I pay more attention to research work and balance the protection level
with the severity and chance of hitting. What I learnt from this game is to do
research, have better understanding of the risk so that we can better mitigate those
risks.  I also need to consider the factors that assist me in the risk management process, such as: cost, timeliness and preparation for the risks. 

If I am tasked to develop a new version of this game, I
would add the function that allows the capacity buidling function
for risk management. This means the capacity of the community to confront the risk and to
mitigate the risks. The community also need to understand about the risks and train
to prepare to take risk and learn how to mitigate the risks. For example, for a community who is living near the coastal area, it is not a good idea just build the infrastructre, because the infrastructure will be washed out by a tsunami, the fund should be spent on a soft side of risk management, such as: better forecasting system, better training for the community how to confront with the risks and how to better mitigate the risks when it happen.
