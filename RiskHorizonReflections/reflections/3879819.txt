The role of risk management in the game was to construct buildings in an area that was prone to comets. Developing a strategic plan to develop the city in a manner that prepared it for future possible disasters was key. It was essential to know when to invest in research and when to opt for insurance. There was also the choice of 33% 50% or 75% insurance coverage. The price of the insurance was correlated to the value of the buildings. Whenever you upgraded buildings, insurance increased.
Being well prepared, meaning having a good insurance, enough research, healthy buildings, and a city at a higher altitude, avoided any damages when comets hit. Preparation for risk was not truly evident in the very beginning of the game, when comets missed or had a severity level which was very low. Often times it was unclear whether I avoided being hit by a comet and consequently being affected by damage due to the fact that  I was well prepared or just had very good luck. However, when more and more comets of high severity appeared at very short intervals from each other, it was clear that preparing in advamce for risk was the right thing to do. I played the game more than once. The first time of course I approached it as a game, without really thinking much. I got as far as level 2 with a few damaged buildings, which I quickly learned I needed to fix right away given that the comets continued to come regardless of the already damaged city. The second time, I had a very strategic approach to the game. I would develop my buildings right away, upgrade them, making them more secure in case of a comet disaster. But i was also very risk aversive, and then imvested a lot of money in research as well as purchased an insurance in order to be fully covered in case of disaster. I learned that if you dont take the right measurements in providing insurance, knowledge or protection later down the road the costs are much worse. You then require more money for repairations and it sets your development plan back a few steps.
Being prepared in case of a disaster always had its benefits! One thing I could propose to add to the game would be an agricultural aspect. Perhaps a few farms with different crops. Planting the crops and making sure that they continue to successfully grow until harvesting time. Taking into consideration sun, rain, soil, pesticides, etc.
