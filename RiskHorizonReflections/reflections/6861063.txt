I believe that in this game risk management has the role both of preventing the negatives effects of a shock, by building connections, elevating the terrain and upgrading the pods, and coping with the aftermath of the shock, by having insurance.I played the game once, and reached level 4, having successfully completed 3 levels.After building the first pods, my first concern was to buy the highest insurance, and I also did research for as long as possible so that I could have more time to build connections in order to minimize the risk. On the second level I upgraded the pods and did the research but I didn't buy the insurance and as a result when the sock it, it coasted more to repair the pods and my development level fell. On level 3, the last one that I completed successfully, I bought the insurance, again the highest and elevated the terrain as much as possible, I also did the research for as long as I could.On level 4 that I didn't complete, if played again I would spend more time upgrading the pods, so that my development would rise faster and less time elevating the terrain.As to the last point on the assignment, the only thing that occurs to me now is making the elevation of the terrain faster, and not as detrimental to the development.
