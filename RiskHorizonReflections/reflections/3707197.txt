Risk management was
utilized in the game when the player had to prepare for the inevitable comet
disaster to occur and to cope with the aftermath of the comet crash by
repairing the developments made on the planet Alora. One of the choices I made
was the type of insurance that I would purchase for protection. I had to make
the decision based on the money I had left after making primary developments
and the knowledge I attained about the first comet. I also had to constantly
check on the given information, like the severity of the damage and the
possibility of hitting Alora, of the upcoming comets to decide whether I would
allocate more resources in adding protection for the planet. I had to confront
constant trade-offs between designating my time and money on protection and precaution,
and allotting resources on reaching the necessary amount of developments to
finish the level.By purchasing insurance in
the early stages of the level and making other preparations against risk, I
managed to reduce the amount of damage received by the developments on the
planet when the comet crashes. I also get to raise the bar of my protection in
a less urgent manner when a comet comes near. And after getting hit by a comet
I would make the necessary repairs on the pods, which are significantly cheaper
due to insurance, and then replenish the protective shields of the planet at a
more casual pace. Â When
I finished playing my first game, I stopped placing all of my money on buying
the most expensive insurance which provides the most coverage. Though purchasing
an insurance is vital if I wanted to reduce my expenses if a comet crashes, I
opted not to purchase the third insurance since it was dramatically curbing the
amount of developments I could make on the planet. Furthermore, the most
expensive insurance does not necessarily mean that it is the best investment in
the long run. It would be useless and a waste of resources when the planet does
not actually get hit by large comets especially in the first three levels of
the game. It would be best to buy the first or second insurance in the
beginning levels and allot the extra money on making developments especially
since it is harder and more expensive to make improvements as the game
progresses. Managing the resources you have is the key to the game. You need to
know when to make developments and when to restock the protective measures on
the planet. If
I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would create more
scenarios where choices are made by the players since decision making in the real
world is more often than not complex and diverse in nature. I would place more
options in deciding the type of developments the player would want to make in
the planet. Consequentially, one particular development will work well against
certain types of danger and the player would decide which threats the planet
would be guarded and vulnerable against. This of course would mean that there
would be other forms of danger aside from the comet seeing that risks comes in
various forms in real life. Keeping up with the space fantasy theme, the danger
may come in the form of alien assailants, meteor showers, shocks from a nearby supernova,
radiation and other threats from space. The sites where the players place their
buildings would also have different sets of pricing, corresponding effects on
advancement, and amount of money garnered after finishing a certain stage in
development.
