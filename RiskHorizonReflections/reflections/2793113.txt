What was the role of risk management in the game? What
choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of
knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk
affect development (immediately, or after some time)?



The role of risk management in this game is (1) to determine
how much money to put into development versus how much to put into protection
and (2) to determine how much money to allocate between the various alternatives
of protection, insurance and research. 
When faced with the threat, my first step was to provide the level of
protection to match the treat. Then purchase the medium level of insurance.
However, as the development expanded, purchasing insurance became extremely
expensive, and I dropped to the minimum level. Having information on severity
and probability of threat was extremely useful.  One of the learning was as the development grew the cost of
providing and insurance became extremely expensive. Preparation for the risk
limited the amount of money that could be put into development. But long term
it is likely better to put some resources into preparation versus constantly
rebuilding after a disaster.  This
simulation was somewhat unrealistic since the cost was in money and did not
take into account the loss of lives and disruption of people’s lives due to
disasters.This game did a very good job of presenting the trade-offs between doing development and risk mitigation preparation.



If you played the game more than once, what did you do
differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from
the game?



I played the game several times.  After the first time, I changed my approach by continuing to
spend on development but upgrading the preparation for a disaster – meteor
hit.  At first I would purchased
insurance. But I then figure out that the information of probability of a
meteor hit and the severity was extremely important in determine the amount of
preparation needed.  When there
were multiple meteors, I would quickly determine the worst case and prepare for
that case.  The hints that were
given after the game were extremely helpfully. This would be similar to a
critique session that would be conducted after a disaster occurred.  The game was setup so that one could
respond fast to an incoming meteor. This is unlikely the case in the real world
since government and communities usually don’t act fast. 



One of the main things that I learned from game was the
value of having information about the impending disaster such as severity and
probability.  Information is critical
in preparing for any risk.  



The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of
risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the
game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you
propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the
place you live? 

I would change the game to make the disaster mitigation
opportunities through insurance and protection more realistic. The game allowed
one to purchase insurance and increase the protection after it was found out
that a dangerous meteor was heading for the development.  This is unrealistic since no one will
sell you insurance when you are about to get hit by a meteor.  And the prevention alternative such as
raising the level of the development takes time to implement. I would install some type of limitation on when you can buy insurance. I also would install a time lag on how fast the protection can be implemented.  This would make the importance of having information on potential disasters extremely important.
