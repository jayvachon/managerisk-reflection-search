Game code: VEKYQ8K1) The role of the risk management is very important, because each participant have to develop a strategy in order to balance the between the cost and the benefit of buildings new pods. In my case, I played the game as 6 times. At the beginning, I did not make good decisions. For example, the first time that I lost, I just tried to build the village and I did not realize how important is the protection. Then, I became aware of that. At the end, I understand that knowledge is the most important in order to take a decision, because if the risk and the severity were not higher, I could still invest in the village. In that cases, protection was not important. However, if risk and severity were higher, I had to invest more in protection. The equilibrium between cost and benefits it is a complete challenge.2) I could say that I have learnt in the game that knowledge it is the most  critical path in risk management, because base on knowledge I could decide between the money to invest in protection and in to build the village. Finally, I could say that invest in insurance always helped me to reduce the losses. The thing that I did different between all my attempts would be more aware about the knowledge of the meteorites in order to take better decisions. 3) I would add the probability of the meteorites to hit the land, in order to make better decisions.
