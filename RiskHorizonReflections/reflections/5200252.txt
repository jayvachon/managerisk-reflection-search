For the first two-three attempts I concentrated more on protection and insurance, and I did not take the risk of developing the city. Even though I protected the city from the meteors, and did not take any damage, I still lost. At the beginning, I focused more on protecting, and did not asses the knowledge, therefore I lost.  After a few tries I realized that I should balance my resources between building and developing the already existing constructions, but also I payed more attention to the comets severity and chances of being hit. By doing enough research, and gaining more knowledge,  I was able to prevent the damage the comets  would have caused otherwise. I still purchased the insurance because, even though it doesn't seem that it makes that much of a difference, it helps you rebuild much faster.In my final attempt, I balanced the knowledge I gain from researching the comets, I tried to match the protection level with the chances of being git,  but at the same time, I continued to build and develop my city.
