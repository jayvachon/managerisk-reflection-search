What was the role of risk management in the game? What
choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of
knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk
affect development (immediately, or after some time)?

If you played the game only once, what would you do
differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game
more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the
main things you learned from the game?

The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects
of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the
game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you
propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the
place you live?
