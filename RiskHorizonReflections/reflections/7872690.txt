ROLE OF A RISK
MANAGEMENT

The role of risk management in
the game prepares for possible attack on the pods and measures to manage the
effect of the attack if occurred.

CHOICES MADE

The choice made was to adopt
insurance policy of 75% coverage for the repair cost of the pods and for the replacement
of my lost development. Of course the consciousness and awareness of the
possible attack also helped in the preparation for it and also protecting the
pods from being attacked.

HOW PREPARATION AFFECTS DEVELOPMENT

Preparation for the risk
prevented the country (pods) from being wiped out. Sometimes due to the
preparations, the possible attack did not have any effect on the pods. The
awareness and consciousness of the attack provoked adequate preparation both on
the insurance policy. The preparation policy 75% coverage also saves the
country enough funds to manage the possible effects of the attack.

PLAYED IT MORE
THAN ONCE

What I did differently was to
increase the protection rate often enough to prepare for the possible attack. In
the first attempt, I hardly increase the protection rate and this often prone
the pods to possible effects of the attack. This explains that in risk
management, the protective and preventive measures should be strengthened and
revisits concurrently to prevent future attack and reduce its effect if occurred.


DEVELOPING A NEW GAME

What I would like to add is, in
case of flood, I would create room for drainage creation. This implies that how
drainage would be constructed to prevent possible flood.
