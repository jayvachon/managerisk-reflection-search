Essay about the Risk Horizon Game.


 

By: Juan David Arenas
Bermúdez.

 

The Risk Horizon Game challenged players to develop an
assigned village. To achieve this development it was required an important
balance with an exact proportion of the components we are working on the
course:  Knowledge (got it by the
research, it let us know about shocks and reduce uncertainty), Protection (to
minimize the size and probability of losses) and Insurance (to back up the
development we had reach in the moment). Also copying (the last component) was
necessary when the meteorites hit. I believe this balance was the role of risk
management in the game, without the RM concepts things could get complicated
since the start and this could have been reflected in the tradeoffs during each
level. 

 

Choices have to been fast and profitable, because time
and money are also influential keys (or obstacles, according as you looked it)
for development. They even, for me, are part of that suitable combination or
balance target previously mentioned. These decisions also were mainly aimed to
knowledge tool to know the severity of the problems and what sub-decision was
convenient to make. However, like in real life, you cannot neglect the
development of the locality for being busy just researching, just protecting or
building, etc… (I mean, agents can't focus all the forces just in one tool)… So
the best option is combining: while you research the problems (meteorites in
this case), you should also begin the relevant constructions (pods’ built) or
buy some convenient insurance (especially if you would deal probably with
systematic risks).

 

During the times I tried the game (3 times), I changed
my strategy: I started to research more and protect a little bit less,
considering that firstable I had to know which was the problem to face,  in order to confront it; and secondable, that
it allowed me to save more money.

 

I learnt the importance of making decisions trusting
in your capacities and looking for efficiency. They weren’t bad or good
decisions, they were just decisions, but while you integrate the topics that
have been learned (in this case, RM theory) it becomes easier to advance and
these new sets of decisions are more efficient, allowing you to get benefits after
having faced the risk (in this case, reach the next level was the reward). This
efficiency is also achieved when you manage your resources well, in this case
time and money. When you don’t warrant its proper use, they become obstacles,
as I had previously mentioned on paragraph two.

 

Finally, if I have to add a new aspect or fact in the
game to deal with, based on the place i live (Medellin, Colombia), it would be
illegal payments known as “vaccines”, which are payments made by people with
own business (even big companies) to gangs or some criminals sporadically. In
case the person denies to the pay, retaliation is taken by the collectors; so a
percentage of the entrepreneurs decide to better pay it, while another
percentage request help to the authorities. This is a hard phenomenon to
control because some gangs have too much power in here. In the game context,
there would be a kind of thieves or gang that often takes a little part of the
money you have.
