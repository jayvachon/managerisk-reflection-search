The role of risk management was quite simple and clear in this game. First of all, you have to build the pods and then manage them. you have to manage the risks by observing the comets, for example how fast is the comet, what is the severity, and how much research is needed. The way i tackled it was based on the severity of the comet. If it was very severe i spend my every dollar on insurance, i researched it thoroughly and kept the meter on the right on its pace. The more time i spent observing it, the more time i got in the end to recover it which reduced my damages very much and in some cases very severe comets did not affected my pods. The trade-offs were obviously money, to upgrade my pods or buy insurance. In some cases, the speed of comets was fast and i did not have much time to gain knowledge about it. preparation for risk helped very much. If you have enough resources and you are efficient in managing those resources the effects of these comets can be minimized. The main thing which i learned from the game was how to manage the resources that i have. Initially i was not spending some time on research and my recovery time was only few seconds. Then i spent time according to the severity of the comet and same is the case with the insurance. I bought expensive insurance which covered more for severe comets and vice-versa. I also learned that we can upgrade the pods the second time i played. It helped a lot in recovering fast. A person may not see a comet hitting earth in one's life, but if it would be an earthquake or a flood it would be more realistic. The pods can be changed to a house, or something valuable for us. My point here is that a person should feel the "what if" scenario here. What if he was there in a situation when you know a tornado is coming to your town. From my point of view it would be more realistic.
