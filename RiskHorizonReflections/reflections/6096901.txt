Risk management is part of most, if not all, strategy computer games. In playing Risk Horizon, I found - after many times failing at level 1 - that insurance is very, very useful, in recovering after a comet strike. I found that in order to achieve success, I had to prepare for that occurrence, and invest in insurance, even if it seemed to be  a loss at that moment. I gladly gave up knowledge and was happy to slow down the development of the pods in order to make sure that I had the best kind of insurance that I could afford at any given time, knowing that even though the probability of being hit hard was not that big, it only takes one heavy blow to make me lose the game. One of the features that would make the game more realistic would be to not take the whole amount that is due for building or upgrading right after you've selected it, but gradually. It would be more realistic to be asked for an initial investment, that would be a portion of the total cost, and then the balance to be taken as the building progresses. I would also allow to pause the building and the development progress, but I would penalize for the pause accordingly (a smaller amount, of course).
