   Playing the
game Risk Horizon the goal is to build water ponds and upgrade them in order to
help my community. To achieve that i needed to take some decisions about the
threats that exists like falling comets which can damage the water ponds and
stay behind the schedule.

   During the
game I had to make choices about the right proportion between knowledge ,
protection and insurance because the budget is tight and the threats are
getting bigger through the time passing 
by. In the beginning of the game I bought the best package of insurance because
you cant always avoid the threats and so i wouldn’t have to pay for the whole repair
cost. As long as you play the game, the threats are coming faster and they are
doing higher damage to avoid this i had spend money on knowledge and protection
in the right proportions to keep the cost low and avoid the damages. Knowledge
let me get a closer eye of the threat so i could use right way to avoid it and
with the help of the protection i had low damages or even avoid the threats.

   I played the
game more than once in order to achieve higher levels. Practicing to avoid
threats and managing better my budget i achieved to build high level water
ponds and help the community to succeed its own goals by supplying them the
sources the needed in right time. The main thing i learned from this game is
that knowledge comes with practice. The more i was playing the better i was becoming
in managing my budget in order to avoid the threats and help my community.

   Risk Horizon
captures many aspects of risk management with this three basic ways to avoid
threats such as knowledge, insurance and protection. If was in position to
change something in this game i would only add one more measure and that would
be a way to control the threat when we know that we are not in position to
avoid it so the damage wouldn’t be so big .
