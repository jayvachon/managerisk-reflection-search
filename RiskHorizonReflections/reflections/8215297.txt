Most importantly it teaches you this simple game is to be able to find the balance when allocating scarce resources to be able to grow, protect, or minimize the impact and cost by hiring safe. In addition, we can also understand that the experience helps you, once you've received the first impact, you are able to learn and know how to react to future impacts. I've played several times; I have not spent the first of the second level ... I spent too much on growth, not ready for the risk; I even hired a safe. So I learned from experience, and on the second try I found a balance, considering it better to grow slowly but being prepared to defend the risk, and also face the consequences. Then there was a time when I did not grow enough and also not passed the level ... It follows that Balance is the key to the end and grow successfully. To complete the game a bit, which basically would add would be to have to do some kind of work to increase my resources, and the management of this work depended on the speed with which my resources increase (this would represent productivity), an important aspect and key developing countries.
