Well, I
think this game is a good model regarding risk management. The good think about
this is that it helps you to understand the main factors implied in the risk
management process: Research, Protection, Insurance, probabilities and also
Time!!!. Time is a crucial variable in this matter, as in the real life.

What I
tried in the game was to invest as much as possible in research and in
insurance. I understood also that when your civilization is very developed you
need to invest more to rebuild it.

If playing
again I would invest a bit more in protection to check if in that way I could
get better results. I only got level 2.

Of course
is a very simplified model but, well, models are models!! The main drawback of
the game/model is that is based in probabilities/weightings that could be
different in the real life. 

In order to
improve the game I would include different types of risk (with different
effects). I know that in fact that is modeled by the different meteors (with
different probabilities, effects, etc.) but I think that a different visual
representation would help people to understand that it is needed to take care
of different risks at the same time.
