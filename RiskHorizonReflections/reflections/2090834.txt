Effective
risk management was half of a two- pronged strategy that was essential for
success in the game, along with growth and development. Every possible action
had a cost attached. Risk management took the forms of knowledge, protection,
and insurance, while development took the forms of developing new plots, and enhancing
and repairing damage to existing ones. The costs of the elements of risk
management added up quickly; at any point in the game, to have full insurance
coverage, protection and knowledge likely meant little or no development was
going on.

            I played the game multiple times, to
get to level 4 (and 5). The main things I learned were that development and
risk management must be equally weighted, and also be coincident; resources
sitting idle were as detrimental to being able to advance as extensive
development with no risk management.

            The game is great. But, for
improvement, I would have the knowledge graphic a bit smaller and off to the
side. Another level of detail could be added such as infrastructure, like basic
roads. Damage could be to the roads, or power station, airport, etc. Furthering
that idea, the setting and overall theme could be slightly more “earth- like”,
while still being abstract and alien, to be a little more engrossing.
