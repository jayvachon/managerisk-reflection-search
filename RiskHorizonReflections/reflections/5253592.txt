For me the role of risk management in the game
was the reaction, the planing and the coping from some shocks that might hit with
some probability of damage, gaining expertise level by level, deciding the
trade-off between the level of the ponds, the research of the meteors and the
amount of coverage in the insurance. I played it 3 times, and I lost each time
in the fifth level, changing the coping each time a highly deathly meteor made
me lost, even though I improve my methodology. However I lost, in the last
attempt (in which I bought the highly coverage, my ponds had a good level, I made
the highest research that I could from the meteor (the meteor that hit me were
flying very fast), and I had money for the repairs), comparing with the first
attempt (in which I didn’t spend many time researching the meteors and didn’t cover
myself with the expensive insurance), I score significantly higher, which means
that although I
lost the game, the damage that suffered the planet was reduced significantly each
time that I played.

For me the
game have three shortcomings, first of all it doesn’t matter how much knowledge
you’ve learned from the meteors in prior levels, so the knowledge doesn’t improve
even though the meteors were similar. Second I didn’t have some vital
information like the information about how much better will be a pound when it
get improve. And finally that it doesn’t matter how you will prepare, if a
meteor with a high level of damage and probability of occurring flying fast
toward the planet and it hit it you will lose the game.
