Risk
management played a crucial role in the development of Alora. Without
confronting the shocks in the form of comets, preparing for them by undertaking
enough research protection and insurance within a protracted time frame,
development of Alora became virtually impossible. I think the key here was
developing a balance between developing the community and preparing for these
shocks.For example in situations where the severity of the shock was potentially
high ( In the case of a fast moving comet with very high severity and potential
for hit) a tradeoff had to be made between research and protection as there was
very little time before a hit. As such as such a little research was made but
very high protection was undertaken to counteract the severity of the shock.
Initially there was not enough money to generate or amp up enough protection in
which case a little protection was generated, some insurance bought and a lot
of research done in order to create community connections if and when potential
shocks hit in order to avert or reduce the potential damage. Of note in situations  where the severity of the shock was very minimal to none much more
research could be done as opposed to protection, Thus generating more income
that could be used in more development. Insurance was only bought only when and
if the severity and chance of hit was very high. Thus freeing up more money for
development. I guess the risk management undertaken in each circumstance would
have to be adapted to each individual shock.Thus underscoring the
importance of research.How one adapts to each individual shock also depends on
the amount of money available. I discovered that the more I played the game I
became more adept at averting risk, the more risk I averted  the more money
I had for more development. Overtime the more I developed and grew the
community more money was made such that there was more than enough money for
more and more development as well as enough to handle the potential shocks that
came with it.               
                                                                                                                                                                              When playing the game
the second time it was more beneficial t upgrade already existing pods than to
build more individual pods. Time was of the essence I had to balance the speed
at which I upgraded and developed pods with research protection and insurance against
potential shocks by making use of every little opportunity I had to increase
development. What I learned from the game was in this delicate balancing act
between research protection insurance and development, time and money were
potential game changers. If managed well they would become very powerful tools
in risk management and thus open up more opportunities for development. However
every little opportunity for development must be taken advantage of for any
substantial development to take place.                                                                        Nigeria for example is a country blessed with abundant
human and natural resources . Despite our country being declared the largest
economy in Africa worth $510bn over sixty percent of our population live in
extreme poverty. We are consistently plagued with a myriad of problems such as
poverty, inadequate healthcare, problems in education, youth unemployment, lack
of adequate infrastructure and most recently terrorism. All due to inadequate risk management. So if I were to change
one thing about the game it would probably be confronting the risk of poverty
through developments in agriculture, by researching, protecting and insuring
against potential shocks such as climate change that threaten destabilize such initiatives. For development to take place a crucial balance must be maintained between managing risk and taking advantage off opportunity for development.
