Yes it was a simplified game. I do however get the meaning of the whole trade offs/ protection/ insurance. The role a Risk management is to balance all of the choices as best you can to maximize coverage and limit the damage at the same time, while rebuilding your encampment or whatever it is you are protecting quickly as to limit costs, downtime, labor, liability, and the total human impact. I played the game 3-5 times, and I did not make it past the first round, due to limited time for the day. My first game I did quite badly, and did not get more than two pods build and just assessed the game. Once I had learned thru that first initial play I thought for a minute and planned.  I did learn quickly you must make quick decisions on the comets based on a quick assessment, research them better to limit the damage they cause, and prepare for the impact. Fast planning was another key, I did develop a quick plan based on the game itself and every play after that I gained knowledge. After the first round of play I grouped the and built the pods quickly and tightly, bought insurance, scanned the sky, made assumptions, and made protection in between as fast as possible. I did upgrades in the later rounds to the pods as it helped me improve my encampment faster thru increased revenue. Movement helped, If I did one thing to long I paid for it, if I watched the sky, I did not protect as well, if I built to much I could not track the sky. If I could add to the game or develop a part of it I would add more of the ability to multi task. You can watch some things and slightly monitor others at the same time, while every thing else is going on. We all do that in life, it is part of it, the problem is we only get one life, we must maximize the knowledge earlier to get the benefit in the end and along the way. To much fun, not paying attention up front, means years of work later for most of us. The game and theory can be applied in almost any model for a newer version to the game, where I am at instead of comets and waves it would be rock slides, floods, falling trees, just to name a few. This really add's to the fun on your way into work in the dark.
