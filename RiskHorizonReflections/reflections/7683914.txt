Risk Management lesson through game quite innovative but not as much effective.Even though it is capable to  inspire us to some fundamental risk management principles.I can say that there was some role of risk management in the game where we have to face the comets,check its severity level,chances of hit etc and the most above all was the time factor which according is the prime factor not only in the game but also in majority of the real life situations which forces us to take risk.Things like insurance,various steps of protection which were available in the game were able to explain the importance of such factors in the real life situations which empowers us to take calculative though somewhat bigger risk for particular situation or problem.Hence the factors which were present in the game were able to provoke nuance thoughts towards the all kind of various criteria over which a problem depends on such as importance of upgradation of existing technologies,insurance,study of factors related to the roots of the problems and understanding how it can effects the outcome as well as the amount of work done by the user towards the problem.I played the  Risk Horizon game twice.During the first attempt i was able to reach the level 2 which unfortunately i was not able to fulfill the requirements for that level.I tried it twice and from prior attempt knowledge this time i was able to complete the level 3 ad reached level 4 and i was defeated by the narrowest margin possible.During first attempt all i tried was to improve my level by upgrading it as early as possible without giving any importance to the security level as well as the the information regarding the comets.Though i completed the level 1 by whisker and continue implementing it in the 2 level also but that did not worked this time and i was defeated.I tried the game again this time with a different approach.I gave the importance of the security level as well as the insurance and this time i was able to reach till level 4 and was defeated by the slightest margin due to ignorance or mistake by me as i was hit once severely and after that in order to achieve that level faster i invested in upgradation which took much of the remaining time and meanwhile i got hit by another comet which just broke with severe damage overall.Hence i figured out that my mistake was the only investment in upgradation and no focus on the insurance as well as the level of security.So it teaches me the importance of the insurance as well as the level of the protection which can be so helpful in the worst times and ensures speedy recovery after any disastrous effect.I would like to sum up by having some comments on the game.Game has many fascinating features although it looks to simple and not much creative.It implies and can have negative impacts on any one's mind.It needs major overhaul maybe you can just change all the background plot and make it more creative or catchy.As far as the game from point of view to teach some basic factors of risk management,although it had all factors but it explicitly mentioned.All I meant is that no one can understand the major motto of the game if it was not mentioned by Coursera as Risk management game.Time can be more and speed of the comets if increases much more than the game along with decrease in the rate of money then it might have been the real test for the users.
