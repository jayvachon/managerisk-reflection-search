The role of risk management was to avail important information about   an impending risk through timely and extensive research on the possible dynamics of the risk. through this knowledge protective measures  are put in place in order to completely avoid the risk.However, some risks cannot be completely avoided as witnessed in the game,for instance other measures such as taking insurance cover to cater for  the feared outcomes of the risk are immediately taken.Due to this nature of some  risks ,with the aid of research information gathered earlier about the risk other coping measures are taken such as community networking to deal with the aftermath of the risk of the risk are taken. As it is the case with reality situations,it also proved difficult to deal with risk management preparations as well as  carry out development projects that are necessary. This is due to lack of resources or availability of very  limited resources. All of you must have realised this from the game.Building as many pods as possible proved too challenging when the impending risk clearly manifested itself and needed extra attention and resourcesThe amount of resources available for development greatly reduced as strikes from the meteors became very frequent,repairing the pods was almost impossible with this situation.Playing the game once was very difficult as i had little information about the nature and severity of the risks. So i kept on failing and i had to do it again and again and one thing i realized was that the more i kept on trying trying the fewer  the causalities i suffered hence the lesser i spent on repairing back the pods. This was evident  because as i think you also noticed this in the game the characteristics of the risks kept on repeating, this way it was now easy to combat and deal more precisely with other coming risks due to earlier  comprehensive and accurate knowledge.This explains the reducing number of casualities in every next attempt.From the game i have grasped fully both short term tactical moves to combat risks and long term strategic measures to be taken to avoid future crisis from same repeated risks and even new ones.The game is good but i think it should be made real with daily life situations like resource variances  at different times of the year ,a population that has normal characteristics of human beings like refusing to migrate when a risk alarm goes on,also institutions such as governments and non governmental entities  should be considered and may be included in the game.
