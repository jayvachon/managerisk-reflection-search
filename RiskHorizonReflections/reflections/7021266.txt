Game Reflection :

The role of the risk management game was to teach how and why risk management is important for healthy development in a specific community with specific needs and urgency. In terms of knowledge, I made sure I understood shocks that may happen or hit an area, prognosticate different types of shocks, following very closely their vicious trajectories, their impact, and possible after effects which may force people to live under harsh conditions for a very long period of time.

In terms of protection, I had to envision the immediacy of negative impact on the environment, how to reduce the probability and size of losses, and increase the benefits to be derived from the efforts, risk management initiatives taken to ensure viability of decision-making plans, and sustainability. Prepare those who are vulnerable to build resilience in the face of tragedies. 

In terms of insurance, I took great care to consider the transfer of resources across the people within the concerned community, from good to bad status of  the country; cultivating a proactive attitude, taking positive, energetic actions to prevent occurrences, and/or reducing devastating impact on development was my aim objective while playing the game, because I strongly believe that whether risks are systemic (natural disasters, earthquakes, flood/Tsunami), imposed, or idiosyncratic, development can occur only by successfully confronting risks and pursuing available opportunities, making efforts, such as updating technology, making up to date equipment more accessible, in addition to helping the people recover from losses and derive the most benefits. But in the context of the game, pods damaged from flooding can be rebuilt quicker and at a less expensive price; insurance also covers lost development time after the pods are repaired.

Actually, I played the game twice, but not completely the second time; so, if I had played it fully the second time around, I would have moved in a more swiftly manner, clicking on the comets that were advancing one following the other before they reached their targets; moving in a swift manner, being vigilant, well prepared, and being proactive, while using the three powers ( Research, Protection, and Insurance) in concert with development to help create a healthy community, in addition to finding the perfect balance, are the main things I learned from the game. In fact, balance risk preparation is very important, seeing that the community falls victim to these falling comets, and we know that the shocks resulted from these comets creep into the water and cause waves that hinder development within Alora.

From a risk management perspective, I would recommend the use of larger images with more specific captions for a new version of the game; and this would fit perfectly well, or best represent the risk management choices that matter most in the community where I actually live.
