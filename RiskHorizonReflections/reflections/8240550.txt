The role of risk management is very important in the game because if choices are made without a plan the result will be a rapid failure. It is important to balance knowledge, insurance, and protection and not base everything only on one of them.Despite what it seems, take actions immediately is not always the better choice and sometimes, despite the great efforts, the adopted solutions can be revealed as looser.Knowledge is very important but in no insurance and protections are activated is not enough to result winners. Insurance is particularly useful in case of damages, but it happen to have several level without damages, so if the protection level was quite strong, and many connections were created, the were no damages even when hit.Compared to reality, the time available to take decisions before a negative event occurs was much shorter than in reality, and even the time required to raise the protection level. But if taken with the proper time protection saved the island. Proportionally, also in reality is important to understand that often there is the time to take measures (e.g increase the protection level of an area or activate insurances), but in order to do this is important to gain the adequate knowledge in the proper time, and take decisions based on this.The change that I would made at this stage is an improvement related to the communication of the costs and the effectiveness of the adopted measures. While playing could be seen how much was spent for constructing renewing, rise the island and so on, while at the end of each level could be given a percentage of usefulness of the amount spent on each measure. This would allow to better understand the result and improve the management choices for the following attempt.
