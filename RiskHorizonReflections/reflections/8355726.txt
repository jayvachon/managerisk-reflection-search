Essay about
Risk Horizon

The games
history base and story line was to present the choices you as a community have
to choose between. Is wealth the only way to go or do you also need knowledge
and preparation about the dangers to come. My experience with Risk Horizon was,
as the video lectures, that preparation is key. If the community isn’t prepared
for a disaster then you’re really in trouble. But preparation can stand-alone;
a community can’t put all of there resources into preparation because how are they
going to survive then? So I learned the trade-off’s the community faces when a
disaster occurs. The best mix of goods is in my opinion 40% preparing, 30%
growth in wealth and the last third is knowledge about the disasters. This is
not only the order they should occur, it should depend on how urgent the
disaster is. If there is time for growth in wealth and knowledge before the
disaster occur it would be the best solution but again wait and se how the
scenario develops and react on the base of that. 

My own
performance in the game was level three and I fail to make the society grow
enough so along side preparation I couldn’t make it to the next level.

The game
was surprisingly true to the hard choices the community faces when a disaster
occurs and I have learned to use the tools given by the MOOC.
