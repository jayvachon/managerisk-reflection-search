Risk Management help me to confront the risk of comet and destructive waves in Alora Island while developing.To do this I chose to allocate my limited resource among; research on comet hitting and destructive potential predictions, procurement of policies, raising the elevation of the Alora and speed of development. Community connection increase our shared comet experience and resilience. determination to continue after the hit. Preparation for risk management enabled the development of Alora despite the risk of comets and destructive waves.I played the game and won stage one many up to ten different times, but was deprived of progression to stage two by destructive comets and accompanying waves that forces me down on the performance bar below stage one. This makes recovery difficult.I explored the options of heavy initial investment on development, research and insurance to heavy investment on research, scaled development or building of pods and relative investment in insurance. I also tried heavy protection and research with scaled development and insurance. But was not able to progress to the desired stage.I learned from the game that we need to confront risk in other to develop, as encapsulated in the comet and destructive wave risk of Alora. One  comet after another keeps emerging from the Horizon as our development effort bring us face to face with different risk scenarios. This impress on me that risk management is a continuous process.Investment in research pays off; that was an unforgettable lesson for me.the perfect balance required to build and develop Alora was difficult to achieve as real life situations may be difficult. Will power or determination is required to elect to follwo the course of risk management.I would appreciate the risk gamoe make available review of what one has done wrong after a stage is lost.
