The role of risk
management in the game was to reduce the effects of negative shocks from the
comets on the development of the alien community. In the game, I focused on
development first, then when comets started appearing, I found out more about
each of the comets (knowledge), put some resources into protection, then bought
an insurance plan right before the first comet hit. As the game progressed, I tried
to develop the community whenever I had the resources, all the while, kept an
eye out for incoming comets. Of all the risk preparation steps, I focused the
least on protection, because I felt it was the most expensive and least cost
effective (it consumed both money and time). I realized that when I spent my
resources on preparation for risk, immediately, I had less money for
development and I had to wait a bit before I had enough resources to develop
further. The lag in development also reduced the growth in speed of
accumulating wealth. However, when a comet did hit, the preparation for risk
paid off in that it reduced the likelihood of the development being damaged,
and even if the development was damaged, it reduced the cost of repairing.

I played the game more
than once. After my first game, I spent a lot more time on researching as
opposed to building protection. From the game, I learned that (a reasonable amount of) knowledge
of risks should come first before pouring resources into building protection. For
developing countries/communities that have less resources, they cannot afford to
have all types of protection. Since resources are limited, it is important to
know what types of risks (i.e., earthquake, hurricane, flooding, diseaseâ€¦ etc.)
are more likely to happen and have more severe negative shocks to the
community. Then after knowing which risks are more likely to cause (severe)
negative shocks to the community, they could allocate resources to provide
protection for those types of risks. (E.g., for a place that is prone to
earthquake but not likely to have flooding, instead of pouring their limited resources into drainage system, put it to use in enhancing structural integrity
of buildings.)

I live in California USA, one of the current major risk is the shortage of water. If I were to change the game to represent the risks in California, population would decrease and people would grow unhappy if there's not enough water to use, knowledge could be new research on technologies to creating potable water or water conservation technologies, protection could be enforcing a water quota restraint and insurance could be building plants that convert seawater into potable water.
