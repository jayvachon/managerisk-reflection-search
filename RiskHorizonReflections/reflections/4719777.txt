My reflection on the Risk Horizon game is that risk is everywhere.Things change, and so do risks. Success in business often comes down to recognizing and managing possible risks associated with potential opportunities and returns. The types of risks faced in most businesses are quite varied and far ranging.Risks typically include both financial and physical categories. Types of risk include sometimes apparent hazards, such as safety and health risks associated with operations, as well as financial risks from exposures to market price volatility, counter party credit defaults, and legal liabilities.Effective risk management (the game) requires that one reevaluate risks on an ongoing basis, and forecasting future exposures is necessary since hedge decisions are based on projected risk (the game) levels.The organizations that are the most successful at project risk management have both a top down and a bottom up approach, so risk management is mandated and supported from senior management, and each team member is empowered to speak up and take action. Employees who identify risks early are recognized and rewarded.Hence, all risks should be identified, analyzed, and prioritized, the risk response is the activity that adds value to  the project. The right response can prevent a risk from occurring or minimize its negative effects. Our responses should include risk avoidance, risk minimization, risk transfer and risk acceptance.By implementing risk management into a project early, and ensuring risks are openly communicated throughout the project, teams can be more successful in delivering on time and on budget, by avoiding unexpected risks and sticking to the project timeline. And last of all, share what worked – and what didn't, throughout the business so the future bids and projects have a library of best practices to call onHowever, if I am tasked with developing a new version of the game, to change or add one simple thing, I would propose to better represent the risk management by making it part of a whole project embraced by all team members. This step (in the place I live) will be better rather than teams looking only to the project manager and assuming he is managing all risk for the project, the entire team must be involved.
