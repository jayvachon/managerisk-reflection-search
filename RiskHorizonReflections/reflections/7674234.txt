The role was to understand the balance needed to confront different reality and risks.I start choosing to be very careful, i want to expand and increase protection, but i did all of  that with no plan, unbalancing my preparation to an eventual impact, this often reflect negatively on the development of the community and i can see that after some time the preparation for risk effect my community.I've played the game more than one time and i try different approaches, focusing on each aspect  too much, this teach me how some tasks must be prioritize and, like a gamble, it teach me that risk management is not only preparing and coping with risk, but also taking risks,being aware of the possible negative results, accept losses and damage, learning from them, and try to be always a step forward, sometimes we look at the pods, the comets and the protection and we think is going good, but the real question in risk management i think is; will it go good in case of xxxx ?i will add a "knowledge bank" where i can build and store research made holding a button, that will make recovery from an impact much more faster, because my community have learned how to react to those damage.It was an interesting exercise, not so difficult, not so complicate, on the forum i saw people complaining and playing like is a game and they want to win, this, i believe, bring them out of the main reason this game was proposed. I have played just few times and i have enjoyed to learn how we can set up our mind to act or react, to prepare, manage and gamble, to create and plan life, my objective was not to win, but to understand, i did, i won.I believe that since most of us come from different reality, culture and want to achieve different target, we all react differently to the game and the course, i wounder if you prepare yourself for some offensive comment, critics, and complaint, i prepare to those with one single question for those people: Were you ready to face a simple game?I believe they were not, we discuss and we study risk management with real risks and disaster in our mind, typhoon, earthquake, tsunami, financial crisis, and so on, but are we ready to face those events when we are not even prepared for the tasks ahead?We start to build from the us up, we will never be able to effectively manage risks if we cant manage ourselves.
