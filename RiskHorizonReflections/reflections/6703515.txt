1. During the game the role research/knowledge played in the game was of primary importance. As is so often in the world, humans tend to rush in without the correct knowledge of a situation. As the game progressed I learned to be a bit more diligent about the research aspect and to take more time in the research component and then assess the potential impacts, in the game's case, would a meteor strike?I found that insurance plays a key role in risk management; in this case having a provision for repairs after a meteor strike. One also needed to retain funds to allow for the shortfall on insurance cover. Sometimes, development took place too quickly, leaving a shortfall for repairs after insurance paid out. However as time progressed and the requisite knowledge research was acquired, development was maximized to its full potential2. Main thing learned from the game: Conduct the research prior to purchasing insurance. This allowed assessment of potential strike impacts. I didn't particularly enjoy the game as I found it a bit cumbersome and the protection component wouldn't activate.3. One of the biggest risk areas where I live is the risk of Bush Fires. I would like to see a component added to the game that allows you to choice more realistic risks than meteor strikes. For example, flooding, earthquakes, fires, etc.
