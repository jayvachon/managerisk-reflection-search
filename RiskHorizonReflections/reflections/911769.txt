1. The role
of risk management in the game was to find the balance between the resources in
disposal for enveloping the infrastructure system and their costs in face of
coping shock’s afterwards.  It was necessary
to combine the capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope
afterwards. 

In the
first line I paid attention to the protecting measures to lay the first stone
in the colony safety.
Then I took construction measures and insured my buildings. Certainly it was
very necessary to do it time-bound and under the taking researching of comets. 

Like in a
real life the whole development of the colony was possible only in complex
trade-off-measures. It was very necessary to research an approximate cycle of
planet life to understand the cycle behavior for “predicting” the investment
sequence. After the comet-damage the cycle began again for taking protecting and developing measures.
 

2. If you
played the game only once, it would for me hardly possible to understand the
planet life cycle system and then to develop my strategy. My first playing was
devoted to get the play rules and to get some experience in planet life-cycle.
The main things I learned from the game, was to understand, that a rapid
development without (long term) investment in protection, knowledge, insurance
and coping the afterwards is impossible.

3. For
better representing the risk management choices that matter in the place I live,
I would propose to integrate the weather and seasons changing, that could influence
the behavior of player, the objects and magnitudes in combining with the risk
evaluation, shocks depth and coping measures.
