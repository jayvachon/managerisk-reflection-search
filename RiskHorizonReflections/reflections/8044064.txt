I
must say I really enjoyed playing the game, it was more like a simulation of
real world. Initially it took me a while to understand and then I developed my
strategy. I maintained a balance between confronting risks and working ahead to
establish pods. I invested almost equally on insurance and protection. I
realized that if I spent more on making and upgrading pods, I would be more
likely to have greater loss when hit by the comets. When you sustain damage
from comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if I
spent more on preparation for risk, I would not have enough money to develop
the community, which was required to pass the level. I had to stick to the
balance policy, having limited resources there was a tension of making decision
between spending on risk management or to spend on other development
priorities. Later I shifted my attention on building pods as fast as possible. I
made use of insurance only when there were chances of all comets hitting at the
same time.
