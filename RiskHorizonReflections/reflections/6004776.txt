The
role of risk management in the game was to achieve a certain level of
development for the community and at the same time protecting it from risks which was natural disaster in this case. Also
having proper insurance hence a coping mechanism in place. From the knowledge I
obtained from the research, I had to decide how much money is to be spent on
insurance, for protection by elevating the ground and the remaining for making pods. This was done after evaluating all the
risks. Proper preparation for risk management insured that the damage from the commits crashing into the community was minimized and the level of development that the community had already achieved was not hampered.  After playing the game once I choose
different insurance from my previous attempt  for different levels as per the requirement. I also learned to manage my time well by letting the pods develop while researching the severity of the commit and accordingly elevating the ground. I learned from my mistakes and made better choices in the next attempt.The game taught me to consider all the factors before making a decision, achieve a balance between them, use different tools available, not compromise on the development and have a proper coping mechanism in place just in case. It teaches how the inability to manage risks may lead to crisis (the commit crashing) and missed opportunities (damages that could have been reduced or avoided altogether with proper protection).  I would
purpose more risks to represent the place I live and not just the natural disasters like corruption, which is a common problem in India. Also more methods of providing protection to the community and not just the elevation of the ground.
