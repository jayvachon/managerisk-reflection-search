the role of the risk management in the game was balancing  the three concept of knowledge, protection and insurance. i tried to know the saverity of the risk and the probability of occur and then invest some cash on research and make appropriate insurance level.i played 3 times and i managed to reach level 2, i think i could do better if i try few more times in the next time by trying to balance and  make the best possible mix for the three.i bought a 75% insurance plan which is not a good idea since the probability of the damage was less than 50% most of the time. so i think the best insurance plan is 50% for the first three level. as well not investing too much in research.if i play the game next time i will invest 50% insurance plan and try to invest 3 level research up the 4th level of the game as well as building more update buildings. i will just try to balance the three concept. trying to know what is coming first before building and research as. i realise that the knowledge is the most important part in the game if you. you cannot invest randomly or you will suffer a loss or high damage. that is what is happen to me in the first level. so the main point is the knowledge and based on it make investment.i will recommend different new risk types in the new version instead of one risk which means multible risks like floods, earth quake and etc. which making it more interesting.
