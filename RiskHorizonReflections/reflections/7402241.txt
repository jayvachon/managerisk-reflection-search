Playing this game was
very challenging. The instructions were not precise enough. At first, I did not
understand the risk management aspect; I was too busy trying to understand the
game itself. But after numerous tries, I was able to have a better
understanding of the risk management aspect that was presented. The role of
risk management in this game was presented through the different options
available towards one single goal, a sustainable development. The latter was characterized
by combination of knowledge, growth, protection and insurance. It was important
to find the right combinations to ensure a continuous growth of the community
after the different obstacles.

At first glance, it
seemed obvious for me to increase the protection, in order to nuance the
impacts and prepare for the next comets. However, I quickly understood that it
was not an effective long term solution. Trade-offs was highly important. My strategy
was to start by building the community (three at a time), then add an insurance
to lower the cost in case of an impact, and finally raised the protection.  Preparation for risk, as it was presented in
the videos, included different factors such as knowledge, insurance and
protection. 

If I had played the
game only once, I would have start paying attending to all the other options.
It is easier to just focus on the obvious option (which was enlarging the
community) than to think outside the box and incorporate all the possible
factors that have an impact on the final result.  On the other side, if I had played more than
once I would have strategically combined all options. Combine the option also
requires a precise timing. I had a very difficult time, understanding when to
act and when not to act.  But overall, I
learned that different factors get involve to produce growth and I also learned
that community support is majorly important. Resources, as we might thing, are
not always the only problem; therefore as a risk management agent, I should
look more closely in all factors. 

It was a good game;
they were able to present a close version of a community struggling for
economic growth. However I have some recommendations. First, to have a more
detailed instruction on how to play the game; then to explain how the community
supports work and allow the support to happen even before the shocks and
finally to allow the community to be relocated(far from the border) as a
preventive action.
