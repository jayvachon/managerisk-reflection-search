Research,protection,insurance and building were 4 ways to
cope with the collision risk in the game.When I started the game, first I built
as more constructions as I could, because with more buildings we could connect
together and made the insurance effective.Second, I kept raising the lever of
protection before the comets came, which could reduce the damage while collision
happened. Third, insurance was so important and I got that before we
researched.Finally, I started our research as soon as comets emerged, the more
research we did, the safer we were, even with a star whose severity or chance
was small, we believed sufficient preparation could promise our safe. The truth
is I successfully protect my territory after almost ten times’ trying, which
means every collision made no damage, so I felt confused why I always stuck in
Lever 2, I guess maybe the lever of my constructions was too low.

 

During the whole game, time and the growth of money were
the biggest obstacle for me, even though I know how important to develop our
building, I went out of money very time. In this case, financing and resourses
had to speed up with risk management. 

 

Even so, the power of risk management had make an deeply
impression to me, no matter how severe the collision is, we still can protect
and save our home from damage. I have to say, we had to keep risk management in
mind every step. Because if you were damaged in the first beginning, you will
fall behind and it’s hard to catch up. If you made your losses when your cities
are developed, your loss will be higher, and you had to spend more money to
reconstruction.

 

For me, the comets’ collision represented all kinds of
risk in our real world, no matter how many more ways or more means to manage there
will be, if we could use it right and use it  in time strategically,
we could protect our home effectively.
