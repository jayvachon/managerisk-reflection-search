The game illustrates very graphically how preparation for risk pays off in the long run, even if it may seem costly when things are moving smoothly and shocks are not materializing. Indeed the game exemplifies all four elements of risk management, including the three proactive ones of acquiring knowledge - by scanning the sky for comets and studying them -, building protection - by elevating the surface - and buying insurance - to partly offset eventual property damages -, as well as the reactive one of coping - by moving quickly after disaster has struck -.A few conclusions can be derived from the game, which serve as reflections for real life:- A good combination of knowledge and protection building can effectively avoid the manifestation of damages altogether in a wide range of circumstances, by either ensuring that the threat is known in advance so that specific protocols can be adopted before the shock or by putting protections in place that will avoid or minimize the damage resulting thereof.- In case of unusually large shocks, it may not be financially viable to build matching levels of protection or the early warning system may not give enough time to implement the combination of high knowledge and high protection that would completely eliminate the manifestation of losses. In such cases, some degree of insurance may be necessary to mitigate the impact in development of the shock.- Allocation of resources has to be optimized across various risk management elements and with development... developing too fast or investing too much time and money in one particular risk management element may come at the expense of having sufficient funds or time to develop the proper risk management mix.- Running particularly low levels of financial reserves introduces the further risk of not having the flexibility to react to new information and emerging requirements.While I think the game is great in its current format, a possible upgrade could include making a set of specific programs available at each level that the user can selected and invest a certain amount of money on while expecting a return, such as investing X $ in upgrading the knowledge acquisition tools so that knowledge can be gained faster, or implementing special retrofitting program to make pods less prone to damage, etc. Another addition might be the ability to purchase a report providing an estimate of the likelihood of receiving strikes of comets of different intensities in a given year.
