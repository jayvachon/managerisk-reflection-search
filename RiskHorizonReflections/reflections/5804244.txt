The Risk Horizon game was an interesting way to illustrate
how risk management can be done through a combination of knowledge, protection
and insurance. What is important to note also is the objective of the game,
which can be translated in real life situation in that the player/policy maker
would like to go for rapid development and growth whilst also mitigating for
risk of a negative event from occurring. The resources, in this case, the
finances are finite and need to be balanced between the use for development and
risk management. Risk management in this aspect includes three components which
are (1) knowledge, which in this case is research to understand the possible
impact of a disaster; (2) ensuring protection which are actions taken to reduce
the level of losses from a negative shock or improve benefits from a positive shock;
and (3) purchasing insurance which is a transfer of risk to the insurance
provider when negative events strike, by paying a premium at good times, prior
to any negative event.

With increasing level of research, the knowledge of the severity
of the disaster and its probability of hitting the area is enhanced and
therefore it is expected that precautions or mitigating actions are more likely
to be in place. From this game, there are two mitigating actions, which are
building protection against a disaster and also taking out insurance to protect
against the cost post-disaster. Protection takes a longer time to build and
costs money. Given the time to build protection that is sufficient to overcome
the severity of the impact, this is the best mechanism to go for to adequately
protect an area from disaster. However, if there isnâ€™t time to build sufficient
protection, insurance could be purchased to limit the post-disaster rebuilding
costs. However, insurance usually does not cover 100% of the impact and the impact
post-disaster is not often only financial but also emotional. This often times is
not considered in the cost-benefit analysis. Therefore, protection is better
than insurance, but both should be implemented in balance. Having too much
insurance and too much protection is ideal, but this needs to be balanced with
the finite finances and the need for using the finances for development.

If development is coupled with good protection and risk
management, then the rate of development may be slowed down. However, in the
long term, this not only is better from a financial point of view, but it
becomes a culture of society to appreciate good risk management. By playing
this game a few times and experimenting with different strategies, I realised I
needed to find a good balance between developing, ensuring protection for the
severity of the hit and getting sufficient insurance. At first, I always went
for the insurance option and over protected, but that affected my development
and slower development led to lower replenishment of my finances. In the later
rounds, I ensured a balance of these aspects, but most importantly I paid
attention to the level of protection to match it up with the level of comet and
the probability of that comet hitting the area. The main lessons learned is the
balance that is needed to ensure healthy development, without putting too much
at risk and this is directly translated to how risk management should be
applied to in real life.

I live in London, where a lot of the risk management are in
place, in regulations and in everyday lives. Although important, many people
who I have spoken to have always complained about the rigour of some of the
things being implemented and the inflexibility that these measures have caused
them. Hence I think the sharing of the knowledge and the reason behind why some
of these are important should be more widely available to not only allow a
better understanding by the community, but also trigger behavioural changes
which will incorporate risk management.
