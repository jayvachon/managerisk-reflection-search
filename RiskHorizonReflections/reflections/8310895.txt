The
role of risk management in the game was to achieve a balance between risk
preparation and a healthy development of the Alora community within the set
milestones. The choices and trade-offs I made in the game when preparing for
the risk included getting information on the eminent risk, using that
information to make judgments on obtaining protection to influence both the
impact or probability of a shock, or obtaining insurance to deal with the
aftermath of the shock.  The immediate
impact of preparing for risk was the slowing down of the pace of developing
pods when the needed limited time and budget were depleted when they also had to
be used for preparation for the risk.

What
I did differently was to play the game with an improved confidence, and putting
more time on researching the risk, in this case the comets, also develop the pods faster and knew when to protect the development on time before the comet fell.
I also improved on the use of budget, especially on using it on necessary things
like protection at the right time. I learned three main lessons from this game.
The first lesson from the game highlighted the importance of information obtained
through research as well as time management in risk preparation. The second lesson
is that risk preparation appears to be highly
correlated with the budget, preparing for risk involves costs. The third lesson
is to never underestimate preparing for any risk even if available information
points its severity to be low because when the shock happens its damage could be
as huge as the one with a predicted high severity.

The
change I will introduce into the game is an element of people for the purpose
of demonstrating how they cope with the after effect of a shock. I will also
introduce an element of  involving local
communities in the preparation of the risk as well.
