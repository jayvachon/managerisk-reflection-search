The role of risk management in the game would be to provide      a methodology to identify and analyze the financial impact of loss. Making necessary risks to obtain an opportunity, prepare      risk management and insurance budgets and allocate claim costs and      premiums to the buildings. I made a choice of building as many pods as I can along with obtaining insurance and improving ground level which put me at a high risk through level one but in the end i made it. I would say that the risk for preparation came in effect after sometime.If I were the play the game only once, I would concentrate more on the protection of the land and building more pods to raise the development bar.I learnt that we must balance out the protection and development of the organization/business etc. to achieve the best results and also to improve the reputation that also increases the development, also the fact that there should be a good awareness among the community in order to eliminate risks that will improve the development of the community as a whole.I would put in a location add-on, that is, you can choose the location where environmental risks are low but at the same time other risks can be faced like economic risk, if a wider variety of location risk are involved we can expand our thinking skills and understand at which are we able to perform the best. Adding a technology add-on would also be good in such a way that it can allow us to speed up production in an easy, less time consuming and efficient way, also in this there should be counter-productive challenges that would enable us to find a way out of it and improve the critical thinking skills that is vital for actions.
