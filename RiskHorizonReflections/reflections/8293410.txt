The role of risk management in the game was to reduce the
risks caused by the falling comets while trying to enhance development as much
as possible within Alora’s community, thus, by trying to balance between growth
and preparation for shocks. In terms of knowledge, protection and insurance I
tried to balance the three aspects trying to also spend on development of the
community although I generally spent more on protection and insurance thinking
that if on the one hand protection would avoid damage while if damage occured
purchasing insurance would then allow me to spend less to recover from damage.
Risk management definitely affected Alora’s development by positively
influencing its growth and this was evident right from the beginning. For
instance, the fact of successfully managing the shocks caused by the comets
would avoid coping costs which could instead be used to further develop pods or
to start new ones. 

 

If I were to play the game again I would probably spend more
money on protection since it seemed to me that I could have further avoided
risks related to the falling of comets into the ocean. Also I would probably
spend a bit less on insurance and a bit more on knowledge so as to balance the
three aspects a bit more and be more prepared.

 

To better represent the aspects of risk management of the
place that I live in, I would add a warning system button in the game. This
could allow the player to understand the benefits of a simple but effective and
efficient mode of protection which is very useful where I come from.
