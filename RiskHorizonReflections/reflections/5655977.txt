 The role of risk management is the game itself. It is
necessary to continuously evaluate where your community is standing in terms of
development, preparedness and safety. The first choice I made was to focus on
developing and creating the community while there were periods of no meteors.
When the meteors started to come more often, I decided to focus on their
research, which gave my community more knowledge and tools to prepare. In the
cases where the severity and the chance of a meteor hitting the community was
high, I immediately bought insurance and raised the community to a higher
ground in order to minimize the damage. I did not fully understand the reason
to connect the yellow glowing structures together, but I always did it and
ended up minimizing the damage. At the time when more meteors came, the
development of the community became jeopardized and this eventually stopped me
from reaching level 6, particularly because of the frequency of the meteors and
the time I wanted to spend on researching their potential damage. 

 

As I mentioned, earlier, I did play the game several
times and really did not understand. When I finally understood the game, I
played it once and was able to reach level 5. If I were to play it again, I
would keep a closer look at the development bar. At times I was so worried abut
the damage and the frequency of the meteors, that I forgot about making a
better and more developed community. I also was concerned about trying to keep
my amount of money at a decent level of savings so I could further develop my
community in the future, and this kept me from developing. If I were to play it
again, I would spend more money to continue developing.   

 

I would add a public services variable (health and
education). In addition to building the pods and a community, you could also
have the choice to enhance the public services that are offered to the
community.
