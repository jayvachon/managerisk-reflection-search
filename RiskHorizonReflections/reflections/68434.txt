Its only one way to win in this game - to use risk management tools. Because destruction are always happen.At first stages i more invest in pods, because cost of mistake is pretty low (but you should look at meteors (risks) when you see any with high probability of high destruction - buy 75% insurance immediately!) And sure i always have protection on 4 marks level at least.I played twice - all that i changed next is that i never accumulate a lot, always reinvest But i dont finished 6 stage because pods did not have time be repaired until deadline.Its funny. but after 2 week of course I thought about buying insurance and general health check. in the new version, I would add different mechanisms of knowledge management - now its only to observe the meteorites, but how about accumulate the knowledge? At the beginning of all meteorites are same and only after the observations for the level to level they came more predictiable.Plus it will be better to make some kinds of cycle events - lots of risks are cycle (such as financial crisis)
