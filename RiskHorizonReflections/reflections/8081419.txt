This game was very difficult for me to start playing and figure out. I was only able to reach level two and it took me 6 ttys to reach level 4. You had to be very care and make sure you where protected and also did your research on asteroids. This game taught me that you can never be to careful when buying protection for yourself. In the end I figured out that I needed insurance and research in order to win, where as in the beginning I thought it was very trivial. If I was to try this game again I would make sure to purchase everything I needed to be safe first, except for the first round because the chance of damage is very low due to the low risk of level one.Â The key point that I took away from the game were how protection is key as well as research. You can't have enough of any and that applies to the real world as well. I need to protect myself from outside forces such as natural disasters by purchasing insurance on things like cars, homes and then buy health insurance as well. I think it is very important to be prepared and protected in every area of your life. This is because in todays age the unexpected happens daily.If I where to add a piece to the game to make it better I would defiantly add earth quakes. Being reminded yesterday of how earthquakes can rattle cites and disrupt life. The earthquake that happened in Guatemala was a reminder to all of us living on faults that it can happen any time.In conclusion, this game has given me a broader understanding of how immanent danger may not seem to scary now but when you are faced with it in the future you will be thinking why didn't I just protect myself. If that means moving or buying insurance its up to you but the most important thing is to always be safe. I believe the premise of this game allows us indirectly see how things can affect and disrupt our lives very quickly. Now its up to you to protect yourself, your family and your belongings, make sure to do it in the smartest way possible and all will be fine. Never forget that danger is lurking in the waters.
