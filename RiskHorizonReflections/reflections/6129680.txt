Risk Horizon requires the capacity to consider the main elements of risk management: knowledge, protection, insurance and coping. Furthermore, it provides for the ability to conduct research on impending negative shocks, and allows the player to build community connections after a meteor struck - thereby increasing coping mechanisms and decreasing the impact of the negative shock.I played the game multiple times so that I could better understand the ratio of development and necessary protection in the face of adverse events. Firstly, knowledge was needed - provided by 1) the green light indicating adequate development, 2) information on incoming meteors, including their level of severity and the chance of of hitting or missing the community, and 3) the level of protection through building flood barriers for prevention, and insurance for incurring costs for fixing damage and decreasing the amount of time necessary for rebuilding. I found the following strategies helpful and necessary to risk management as exemplified in this game:Factors Allowing Success: The first few times I played this game, I dealt with building pods and researching incoming meteors as they came. I would purchase insurance only if I saw an incoming meteor with high severity ratings, and tended to keep the flood barrier between a certain level (4 and 5 bars). The idea was to be flexible to execute necessary responses, but the usual result was depleted finances and the inability in finding a balance between building and protection. Deciding what to do as the risk appeared, resulted in a greater possibility of an emotional response. In this way, I gained familiarity with the various aspects of the game, and then decided on what baselines I would always execute (for example, prior to Level II I would build up the flood barrier; after Level II I would buy Level 3 insurance), and what the various indicators would be to signal development or protection. As a result, my knowledge that meteors were a constant threat and could impose severe negative shocks led to my decision to build and maintain a very high flood barrier. This would only be possible, however, with a strong green bar indicating development measures were being reached. Therefore, I focused on building a strong flood barrier in the earlier part of the game, when development levels were easily reached and both times and finances were available to adequate preparation - and with less to lose if all went awry.Conclusions: Once knowledge was gained, planning for actions determined by varying variables (level of development, funds, and protection) could be established. It could be difficult to not respond emotionally in the heat of a crisis, and to ensure that the planned responses were carried out accordingly. Maintaining a high flood barrier - based on the knowledge that flooding was a constant and at times severe threat - was an important baseline that had to be balanced with timely development. Furthermore, insurance was necessary especially once pods were upgraded multiple times and the time and costs in rebuilding were assisted by pre-purchased insurance. Research was also helpful and necessary, but I found the experience gained in dealing with crises provided for more than an abstract understanding of the risks and opportunities. Finally, building community connections was a good way to cope with negative shocks.Recommendation for Future Game: It would be helpful to allow several students to provide recommendations in playing the game, to simulate a disaster planning and management task team. This could double up as another level of receiving information, conducting research, and coping through reaching out to community members.
