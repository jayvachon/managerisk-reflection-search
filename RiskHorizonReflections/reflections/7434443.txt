In the game one
needed to alternate between growth (i.e building more pods and upgrades to
existing pods) and various risk management strategies which included the following
whilst having a constraint i.e. the amount of financial resources:

·       
Knowledge:
Research on the comets, which provides more amount of time later on for coping
strategies if a comet strike does occur

·       
Protection:
Raising the entire community above the existing altitude, in order to mitigate
damage due to the waves when a comet strike occurs

·       
Insurance:
Varying levels of insurance coverage which can be purchased as per the severity
and probability of comet strikes

·       
Coping:
The network connections which helped mitigate the effect of comet strikes

Preparation for
risks made the entire community resilient from destruction by either avoiding
or mitigating the amount of damage incurred and resumed growth opportunity to
as it was prior to the comet strike in a short amount of time.

I played the game
more than once and I learned that I needed to focus on all aspects of risk
management (i.e. Knowledge/Research, Protection and Insurance) while allocating
resources between this and growth/ugrades to the community. Focusing solely on
protection or just a singular aspect towards risk management would not serve
the purpose of creating a resilient community. Hence one needed to multi task
as well, increasing research whilst growth was going on in the background.

The one thing I
would change would be that the existing coping mechanism i.e. intra-community
interaction that is conducted only post the comet strike should actually be
conducted prior to the comet strike i.e. pre-preparation of contingencies. Also to bring out the uncertainty of risks
we can actually have comets which don’t have any probability index present on
the severity/chances of a strike etc.
