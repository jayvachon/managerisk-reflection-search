There was a trade-off between money and time
that could be spent on research, insurance, or lifting the platform (protection).
It wasn’t clear if clicking the yellow clouds representing community connection
cost money, but it did cost time. There was also a choice between number of
pods and level of pod built (Development). I tried several combinations but settled
on a small number (3-4) of highly developed pods with high levels of insurance,
and protection to match the threat level ascertained from research and
experience.

I was not good at the game and only reached L3
after six attempts, struggling to see relevance between the score and what I
was doing. I cannot say I learned much other than that protection seemed to
reduce damage helped and insurance was cost effective. I couldn’t determine the
link between the level of development and status of the pods and the score. I
was not able to tie the game to the WDR-2014 report beyond the most obvious
points of research, community, insurance, and protection being topics one
should think about.

Sorry to be critical, but I am not sure that
this game is an effective way to teach risk management to adults, beyond that
research, protection, insurance, and group help are things one should pay
attention to. I would rather have a SimCity approach and then run case studies
from previous disasters in which choices could have clear outcomes that would
transfer directly to learning. Research could be more meaningful in terms of
what happened and what risks and options were available. A feature i would add
to this version is to have uneven ground so that there was a choice to build on
higher (costly) or lower (cheaper) ground.References: WDR-2014 Report
