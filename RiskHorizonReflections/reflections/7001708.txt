1. I had to protect and insure my village of pods while I try to gain more resources and cash. It is difficult to balance protection, insurance, and knowledge because if I had to direct one attribute of my village I will have to redirect my resources and cash to it. I didn't have unlimited funds to do everything. My strategy was to insure my village as soon as possible while I try to build and upgrade my pods throughout the level, if there was a particularly high-risk comet coming I had to redirect my resources to protection until it passes.2. The first time I played it through I burned all my cash trying to build my village as quickly as possible without any protection or insurance. This had quickly led to my downfall as I didn't have any resources for protection or insurance to defray the costs of the damage. In the subsequent replays, I tried to balance all three attributes while slowly growing my village.3. If I had designed the game I would have switched the focus from a village of pods to a commercial city, I would have used commercial zones as resource gathering systems and used natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes, fire, and crime to simulate risks.
