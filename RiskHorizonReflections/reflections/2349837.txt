1) What was the role of risk management in the game?  In the choice when to develop, when to research, when to defend and when to insure. The risk to be managed was the damage from the meteor strike2) What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? The choice was to develop the buildings, develop the defences or buy insurance. 3) In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?  If more money was spend on insurance or defences early on this slowed development4) In later attempts I played a number of strategies from this I learned that the best option was to invent in Development and Defences earier and only in insurance if after researching a meteor a strike seemed likely5) The simple change I would make would be to add another type of disaster and another method defence - to increase the complexity
