Risk management in the game focuses on keeping the space pads and apparently the citizens of the space colony safe from the dangers of space.  Building pods and making them more advanced for the inhabitants were crucial to keeping the pods populations growing and safe from meteors and flooding.  Money management, information analysis (of meteor severity and flooding) and the purchase of adequate insurance are critical resources necessary to survival.  Understanding the affects of having insurance when needed and providing protection of the pods when required were instrumental in moving forward in the game.  If I were to play this game again, I would pay more attention to the meteor severity information and ensure I focused more on matching the severity then just clicking on the protection button until the meteor hit.  I would also focus more on providing more advancements to the pods more often.  If I could change the game, I would make the information more clear.  It was difficult at times to discern what to do with the meteor information when it was received.  Also, I would provide more information of how and when more resources (money) could be earned to facilitate more advancements.
