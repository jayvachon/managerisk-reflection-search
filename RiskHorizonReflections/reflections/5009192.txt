                                                  World development Report 2014Risk and Opportunity: Managing risk for development                                                                                                                        Game reflection                     In the risk zone game,our mission was to develop Alora's community the best we can; ie,seek for trade-offs between developing the Island and managing effectively the risk it faces.The risk was related to frequent falling comets(negative shock). These comets careen in water and create waves that damage Alora's infrastructure, thus hinder development in Alora.Risk Management had an important role in the game.Indeed,it helped to prepare for the potential shocks,and to cope ones the shock occur.Preparation include establishing policy in terms of Insurance,protection based on what we know about the nature of the comets.To be effective in our risk management,we needed to find the way,to link the key component of risk Management.We mainly focused on this:First,we insisted on the level of research,because,effectiveness of insurance and protection need to gather a lot of information about the severity of a comet,and its probability to hit Alora' island.We didn't chose a high level of reserch for the first time,by the way,our protection wasn't too much efficient to quick recover.Eventually, we increased research,to have the same uptrend,in terms of protection.About,Insurance,we have always chosen the high level of insurance,because it won't cost a lot if protection is high.Finally,our decision to increase protection didn't have its expected result of reducing insurance fees in the short term,because,protection specially in the game,have long term effects.If we had to play the game more than once,we schould have focused our strategy more on good research.First,because knowledge is a key element in the process to establish a strategy to manage effectively the risk of falling comets in Alora.Second,it gives us more time to create a strong community connection right before the comet hits,helping to boost protection.Finally,research helped a lot in the game to reach our milestone.To sum up what things we learned from the game,it's necessary to come back to its main goal,which is capturing some aspects of risk management in a simple way.This way.Our mission,bring us to learn that risk management is critical for development.And that development,is as well as risk management is a continuous process thus we can't aim to complete it.Also,We learned the importance of knowledge,how it is critical such in preparation and coping.In my project to bring the game better represent the risk management,I will add a device in the interface which regulates financial ressources availability.
