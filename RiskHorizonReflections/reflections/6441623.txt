The role of risk management was making decisions about
investment (building and upgrading houses) based on the desire for economic
return, balanced against the risks of the meteor impacts. I gained information
from researching the meteors, which provided detail about the likelihood of
impact and the severity of the impact. I then had the option to mitigate meteor
impacts, by raising in the level of the land or by insurance. Researching the
meteors for longer periods also awarded more time in the ‘community resilience’
stage, which gave the opportunity to mitigate some of the meteor damage. 

I learned from the game that ‘protection’ by lifting the
land seemed to be more effective at mitigating damage than insurance, since the
benefits lasted from round to round, but the insurance costs only lasted a
single round and seemed to be reasonably expensive. I also learned to delay investment in building or upgrading houses
if a risky meteor was coming (eg high probability, high impact) since these
houses would cost more to repair after the impact. In some rounds of the game, I had several severe meteors in a row which seemed to make it impossible to recover from the extensive damage - which is probably like real life in high risk areas. 

I would add an element of ‘avoidance’ to the game. The game
takes place in an exceptionally risky area, which is continually damaged by the
meteors. The game could be changed to give players a choice of landscapes, so
they could choose where they play and what kind of risks they are prepared to
accept. Relocating the houses to a less meteor-prone area could be a better
risk management decision than continuing to play in this zone.
