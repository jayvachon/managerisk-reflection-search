 The game simulates involving
managing risks,
exercising the activities of identification,
analysis, monitoring and control, planning and implementing responses to the
risks.The
game has
the potential to assist in the
learning of risk management.To
this end, the game content is exploited
in situations of uncertainty and under which the player must make decisions that will impact on objectives.This exercises
a process to identify, analyze,
monitor and respond to the risks
of a project in order to maximize
the results of positive events and minimizing the consequences of adverse events.The
advance in the game happens to the
performance of activities, such as a project. As the process of risk management is cyclic, it must be done
at all stages of development.Once
an initiation
phase, the game can be ended at
any time if the risks are not
properly managed.The
choices the player will graduate its performance
feedback and directly affect
the results in terms of cost and time, ie, errors in identification, analysis,
prioritization, and treatment strategy for negative or
positive risks.Considerable
gains are
possible with risk management,
the accepted opportunities
not as attractive investments without prior knowledge of the risks and their measures.
In the game we can perceive it clearly.As gaining experience with the research of meteors we could have spent
less on insurance in the face of
better prediction of the probability of success x potential harm.With
the money saved on good predictions obtained through research, ie historic (SML
= Rf + (RiskPremium) xBeta), we could evolve further.The
risk has
always been an important connotation
in deciding new investments. The slights riskier
projects lead companies
and institutions to lose opportunities with excellent
returns.The
biggest problem is how to quantify the
risks, pricing them appropriately.
I do not really got
stuck in spending on insurance.
I was focused on the prediction and advancement. As
iam a risk
averse person I was always opted for
the more expensive insurance
which obviously hadnt allowed my biggest advance in the game, which
certainly would change a next possibility. As a
suggestion to the game, the same
could incorporate more Theory
of Real Options and
Financial Diversification and its tools, or with
the User being able to work with
historical data and probabilities. In short, great game in terms of general applicability of risk management.
