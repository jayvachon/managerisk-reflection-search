http://www.wideo.co/view/4253951405267366999-product-demo-video-template-copy?from=cpThis is the link of my video where I explain my experience playing the game. The game was really helpful for making decisions about risk management.The role of risk management in the game was to develop a new environment and to avoid a meteors crash. I had to face a lot of problems but finally I learned a lot. There were trade-offs between saving money and buying insurance, I had to decide what type of insurance to buy depending on how well did I do on previous games and depending on the kind of meteor to which I was exposured. Most of the time I spent the money in the development of the city, and I did not care much about buying insurance. My preparation for risk affects development after some time.I played the game many times in order to get feedback and to learn from my mistakes. The time was very limited,and I had to decide quickly. I improved after the first time of playing by taking decisions more quickly, building more houses and using correctly the tools giving by the game. The main things I learned from the game were to manage risk properly by knowing the kind of exposures I had, protecting from meteors and getting insurance.  I definitely had a lot of fun, the game was really creative. If I had the opportunity to create a new version of the game I would add a new agent like the Government or others political institutions because I think risk management is a process where many people take part. Furthermore, I will add rains that are very common in my city.
