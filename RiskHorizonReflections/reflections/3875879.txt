Role of the risk management game is to assess and mitigate the risk. At first I played the game with as much expenditure to protection and insurance. However, I noticed that I was broke at the end with barely very little money for the development of homes.  Choices were to make as many homes as possible with minimal expense on protection and insurance but at the same time covering for the disasters with knowledge on the comets that destroyed the homes. I learned that it is best to build the foudations to as many homes as possible. One change in which I would propose for the game to better represent risk management is to be able to forecast where the comets would land and institute contingency measures to repair the damage automatically rather than wait for the player to institute repair works to respective homes.
