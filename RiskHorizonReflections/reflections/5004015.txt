The game risk horizon enables the player to take on the role
of risk management of a fictitious community that you have to build. The game
required you to think strategically in balancing knowledge, protection,
insurance but also coping when your strategy did not work out as you planned. A
good balance between knowledge, protection and insurance was difficult to find
as I tended to over-insure (selecting the highest insurance option if I had
enough cash) in an attempt to alleviate the damage when any comet would
eventually hit. I did not invest enough in building and upgrading new pods and
failed to protect those I had from incoming waves. This affected my development
adversely. 

Knowledge was gained through the tutorial and experience
playing the game increased your knowledge of what strategies worked better than
others. I feel that I did spend enough on following comets to accumulate
knowledge in the game but at the same time tended to loose time which could
have been better spend building more pods! I often tried to eliminate risks
instead of just alleviating them with the right balance of risk management
components. 

If I could play the game only once I would build as many
pods as I could and spend more effort in protecting the pods I build. I would
only insure if the chance and severity of a hit by a comet would be very likely
and high in damage.

If I could change one thing in the game it would be a change
in scenarios (more disasters than just comets) as eventually you will see a
pattern in the game. With different scenarios (natural and humanitarian disasters,
disease outbreaks, etc.) you would have to keep changing strategies to solve
different forms of risks. This is more realistic because in life you also face
more multiple risks and you generally don’t have time to analyze just one.
