In this game, the comets careen into water and cause waves destroy our structure as a shock, I tried several times and failed in level 5 unfortunately，we should balance the resources to insurance, protection, research, and develop because the resources is limited, spend too much money on protection and insurance will cause slow development, on the contrast, too little spending on protection and insurance may lead huge disaster in our structure, so I judge my strategy in four steps:1) Do research on each comets to check its severity and the chance it will hit, and either the severity or chance is huge, I will keep observation on it, so that will give me much more time to cope the shock if it occurs. 2)Always leave enough money in each beginning of the level to purchase a insurance, the cost of it is much smaller than the potential benefit. 3)Raise the money spending in protection with the level up, especially when I found a lot of huge shock is coming, the protection will become more and more valuable in the high level. 4)Cope the shock efficiently.When the first time I played this game, I even didn't know how to research comets and purchase insurance, I didn't know how to balance the cost, so I failed in level 2. After trying several times, I got how to play this game and found strategy to cope with it, and every time I made a mistake, I would ponder what should I do next time to avoid this problem. This is like the natural disaster in real life, it occurs much more than once so we can learn a lot from previous and do a better risk management. Even so , a lot people don't do it well because of the obstacles.The shocks can be the flood, and we should balance the resource to insurance, protection, the spending on technology or simply on fertilization. I think it's a better representation of risk management in our real life.
