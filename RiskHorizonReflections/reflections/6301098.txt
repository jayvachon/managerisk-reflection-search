General:The game is
a good idea, but in my opinion also a waste of time. I tried it several times
to figure out how it works. Then I could reach level 5 without problems. In
level 6 I got 2 times a “fatal error” and could not go on. In the beginning I
tried to build all PODs in the same speed. But only when I build only 3 and
focused on upgrading them I had enough money in the higher levels. The highest
priority is to get no damages. Therefore I always tried to have the protection
level as high as possible. Only in the first level is enough time to increase
the protection by several meters. And by the way – increasing the protection level
creates money in the game which helps to build faster – but is this realistic?
I found out that an insurance makes no sense in the game because the bottleneck
is the lost time not the money. Concerning the research I got the impression
that it has nearly no advantage in the game. Concerning the severity of the
comets I am a bit confused because it was sometimes much higher as the research
displayed (9 meters instead of 7).

1)Role of
risk management: To have a very high protection level.Trade-offs:
A few upgraded PODs earn much more money as a lot of basic PODs.Insurance:
In the game I could avoid damages. Insurances were therefore obsolete.Preparation
for risk – big advantage: No time and money lost for repairmen = quicker
development.= See also “General”

2)The second
time I only build 3 PODs and improved them: Only when I had too much money it
started to build the others. Only a high
level of development makes it easy to build additional PODs. The higher
developed a country is the easier it is to do additional developments.

3)Add a
simple thing to the game: Education – costs at the moment but helps in the long
run.
