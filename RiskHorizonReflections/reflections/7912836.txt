risk is no doubt uncertain. similar risk can arise repeatedly. in game comet was the risk. the role of risk manager was to reduce or to minimize the effect of comet and to build up the city. to protect the city we should have the knowledge of risk. it was a duty of risk manager to keep an eye on the comet and to see that whether comet will hit or not. city can be protected by keeping the protection bar high. when comet  hit the city the damage loss can be reduced by an insurance. insurance is one way to minimize the loss due to shock. but it cannot be used as a tool to completely reduce the shock.    this game helped us manage the knowledge of risk, how to protect against the risk and how we can minimize the loss. the task was to build and update the pod and to protect them.
