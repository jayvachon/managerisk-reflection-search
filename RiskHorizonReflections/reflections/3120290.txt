I have played the Risk Horizon game, and now I will address the three questions asked. I will start with the first question, regarding the role of risk management in the game. To do this, I will first provide a short description of the game. The game consists on an area where the player can build a limited number of pods that will become a community. Those pods are the wealth pools, the goal is to reach a certain amount of wealth. Comets can sometimes be seen in the sky, and if they hit, they can cause damage to the community, they reduce wealth and the damage has to be repaired, which also costs. The game has some tools, like an insurance, that can cover part of the damage, and also prevention that can meet the predicted severity of the impact. As for the meteors themselves, once they can be seem, you can check how sever its impact can be and how likely it is to hit. If a comet hits, you have sometime, limited by how much you researched the comet, to build links between individual members of the community, and these reduce the damage level.Â I will now address the role of risk management in the game. The role of risk management in the game involves having the right information about the comet, investing in the protection and insurance, but also on the size of the community, since more links between individuals lead to less damage. But also having a minimum amount of money to effect the repairs. It also involves upgrading the pods, to have more wealth. I decided to have insurance from the beginning, started with a small number of pods that I upgraded to higher levels and then built more pods, and always met the severity of the comet before impact.Now as to what I learned from the game, it seems I did not learn much, but it was a chance to see whether I had fully understood the concepts taught in this course. I played the game twice and I would not have changed anything if I were to play again.If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would had different types of risk, so different types of comets and I would try that the management also involves different levels according to the risk that is being faced.
