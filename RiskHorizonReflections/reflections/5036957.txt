I played the game at least four times in order to reach the maximum level, and every time I learned something new.In the first round after showing the tutorial, I was pretty greedy about development and I had enough luck with the comets until the 3rd level, but then after a comet with a big severity I understood how crucial and important it is, to use the protection.At the second time I tried to strengthen my protection so that no comet would bring damages, but then I failed in achieving the development goals, so I had to restart once again.After that I started to balance between insurance and protection since only protection was too expensive, and I got much more successful, but I still didn't reach the last level because of bad time and development management.In the last time I played, I started to buy the insurance and the protection at strategic times, and not just in the beginning of every level, as I used to do. So with a perfect time management I achieved my development goals, had enough protection for preventing big damages and had always opted for the 50% insurance since it was in my experience, the most cost-effective one.
