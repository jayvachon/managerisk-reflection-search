1. ROLE OF RISK MANAGEMENT IN THE GAME:The game involved building a community and using resources to protect against natural disasterstools were: raising height above sea-level, insurance, and builtup community network connections.intangible tools: knowledge (experience)choices made: raise height, buy insurancetradeoffs,  insurance gets more expensive for greater protection, and depletes money.  Raising height was slow and did not work well for me.    Unfortunately my computer or internet connection did not allow me to see the screen fully and was slow to respond to the button clicks, whilst the comet kept coming in.2.  WHAT WOULD I DO DIFFERENTLYI would try to click on community protections (green flashes?, but these did not work )Different strategy for insurance, ( buy more in the beginning, less later ?) Time of 3 minutes was not enough given the slow reaction to inputs.3. WHAT CHANGES ARE PROPOSEDMore time. Dashboards showing comet characteristics, protection, height etc because right now the screen does not display properly and by the time one gets to the corners where the properties are shown, the game is over.
