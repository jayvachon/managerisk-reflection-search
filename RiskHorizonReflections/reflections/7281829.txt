I played the game until I was able to get to level 4 to get full points. On that last attempt I actually made it through level 4 to level 5 before taking a massive hit right before time expired, which did 50% damage despite me being fully insured and having a decent level of protection. My island was looking very nice, with well developed pods. I still had money (and was researching that comet as it came in), but just ran out of time to rebuild. I played many more rounds than I meant to in order to get to level 4, but I did enjoy the experience. My answers to the questions are below:1) The game forced me to make choices between building and insuring or protecting (which all cost money) and between doing any of these things and researching the comets as they came in (I don't know if the building paused during research or not, but I do know I couldn't buy anything while researching, which meant I had to chose between that and adding insurance or protection). Protection also took time. It took me a long time to realize the value of research, which felt like just watching, but spending time studying those comets was very helpful in reducing their impact (and I eventually realized that that also gave me extra time to make connections after a hit--I somehow missed that in the initial directions in a rush to get playing).2) In my first few rounds I spent much on insurance and protection, which cut into my ability to build, so I learned to take on more risk as the game went along (while still insuring and protecting at lower levels). I also learned to do more research to reduce the impact of the comets (and to give me more time to connect if they hit).3) I think it is important to create connections before the comet strikes, so I would like to find a way to do that, but since I already struggled to balance the tasks I had already (building, insuring, protecting, and researching), I'm not really sure how to do that in the real game. I think that would introduce even more trade-offs.I have to confess that at first I thought the game was silly, but once my competitive juices started flowing, I found myself playing much more than I meant to. It definitely dramatized the centrality of trade-offs in deciding how to respond to risk (and opportunity). In the end I was drawn in enough to be quite upset when my nearly completely developed island suffered a devastating hit just before the end of the fifth level.
