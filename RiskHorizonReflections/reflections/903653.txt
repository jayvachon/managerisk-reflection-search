Risk management is about preventing or fight against the destroy of massive danger. a lot of choices and plans you have to be a good planner to prevent the risk you have. First you must have a knowledge about the risk you have from the previous experience that you passed before ,then try to protect your community by a lot of protections that depends on the risk you will confront (the comets that hit the pods in the game). At the first time it wasn't different from later times ,I change the plan a lot of time but i think that if you have a small community don't waste your money in assurance just try to be serious to have protection , you don't need to pay money for assurance because your community has only a small financial value, and of course if your community has a worth value you will pay for assurance to reduce the amount of money you pay to fix the damages. protect your community if it small , protect and pay for assurance if it big .As i played the game i found that the risk management skills you will not get it by chance because it is knowledge , if you don't have a good knowledge about risk management and how to prevent the losses , you will not have the power  to control the crises "knowledge is power", the game can't describe the entire idea of risk management it is just an evidence to some definitions like protection, assurance , etc....  .If i have the chance to be with the developing team , i wish i could make the game more realistic with a real crises and risk that make it not just a game , that will make it more helpful and skill to study the risk management , because when you have a real crises or natural disaster on focus you will learn more than if you only have a game with unrealistic fundamentals.Risk management is a point view of person you don't have the same ideas that anybody else have ,it is very personal opinion you should to be brave to take action .Once i played the game i think it's a must for every one in the world because we are all don't have the same ideas  and all of us passed and will pass a lot of risks personal risks , financial and natural disasters . we should be ready for it
