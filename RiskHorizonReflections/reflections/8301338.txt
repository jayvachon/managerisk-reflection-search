Risk management played a crucial part in my decisions to invest more money on the pods and to protect them and transfer the risks through insurance, based on the changing knowledge about the severity and likelihood of meteor predictions. To succeed in the game, one needs to constantly find the right balance and address trade offs between investing in development without neglecting the risk of development setbacks caused by disasters. The game is well designed and users will not pass to the next levels if they are overcautious and spend a disproportionate amount of resources on protection and insurance without investing and sizing opportunities to grow. Likewise, reckless spending on short-term development gains without investment on protection and risk transfer mechanisms will not allow to succeed in the game. The game shows that balanced investment in insurance and protection allows for sustained growth and for reducing the losses caused by the meteors.I played the game more than once and I learned that it was important to take risks to expand my pods, while also saving money for eventual needs in terms of insurance and protection. As I passed to various levels, I learned that being completely risk averse and not building new pods out of the fear of new meteors was not a path to success. In order to win the game, one needs to invest and grow sustainably, making the right investments on the improvement of the pods and increasing their value while also managing the risk of comets by increasing knowledge of the risks, transferring some of those risks to the insurance market, acquiring protection and coping with the residual risks that materialize by having enough savings to reconstruct damaged pods quickly.If I was tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would add new risks such as other natural disasters and risks caused by the inhabitants of the pods themselves. I would also add the role of safety nets, emergency response actors, neighbors, families and local institutions in helping those in need. I would also add additional possibilities to build the resilience of the pods and their inhabitants to better cope with future disasters, such as meteor resistant construction materials, enforce building regulations and include disaster preparedness in school curricula to educate citizens to better anticipate the risk of disasters rather than react to them in an ad hoc basis.
