The game introduce complete training
on risk management with different levels of risk which need different response depends
on the severity of the risk and its probability of occur  

It also introduces the four component
of the effective risk management which is Knowledge in the picture of research,
Protection, insurance and coping. It gives me the chance to evaluate the risks
that I faced and take decisions depends on the factors we mentioned before. With
taking in consider the development of the planet side by side with avoiding
risks or protecting from them

The first choice I thought in is the
development of the planet because of the resources I had and because I didn’t
know what the risks I would face 

Then I thought about the knowledge
to know the risk and evaluate it and then used the insurance in a wrong step
because I didn’t know how to use the protection tool and then when I discovered
it I used it first then the insurance 

After that I used the insurance tool
twice what considered as wrong step to pay more money on the insurance without clear
benefit from it 

For each tool of risk management
there is an effect on the development at the knowledge we determine the amount
of resources we should use for perpetrate for risk and the amount for development


At the protection it avoids us the
damage of the risks the insurance reduce the amount of damage 

I played the game just one time and the
most lessons I learnt that avoiding risk is not the only thing that we should
consider but also the amount of resource that we spent for avoiding this risk
because of the concept of sustainability of our development and our ability of
get the opportunities

I think more details about the
protection tool like types of protection systems to be suitable for different
degrees of the severity of the risk

If I could bass the level without
using the insurance plan why I can’t use it or at least percentage of it in my
development plans
