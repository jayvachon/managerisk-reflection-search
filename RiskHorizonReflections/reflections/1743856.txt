 The principal role of risk management in the game is that you have to
know the whole idea of the game to develop a new strategy to success so you´ll
have to see if a shock deserve to spend time on it depending on the damage that
it could cause or in the other hand the chances that the shock occurs, with
risk management you can design an strategy that lead you through the differents
level choosing between stopping the development rate by protecting your village
or by taking some insurance because you can’t prevent a shock happening and the
better way out, possible in that moment is to take it. in some times the better
choice possible was to research because you can reduce some damage and allow to
keep development but in any time that you have the chance to get some protection
level in front of a shock is the better way out, so when you have a good investment
in protection you don’t need an insurance and can spend some resources in your
village.
Preparation
for a shock helps in development because you don’t need not be spending time
and resources later, dealing with all the mess that the shock make. 
when
you play the game more than one you start learning the importance of protection
and knowledge and how they could help you to be prepare for the shocks that
come, knowing that when you invest in protection the benefits are shown latter
because all the investment of ou resources come later and by little pieces not
all at once but always is better to be protected from shocks and to spend
resources in that.so when you play the game again you learn how to deal with
the shocks that occurs in it, and in some instances what’s the better decision
to make whit the time you have to reach the goal.I
would add a new shock and new way to be protected from it, the new shock would
be having a lack of resources for example water and a way to be protected could
be by the use of pumps allowing the resource to be used by the people of the village,
so you’ll have to invest in protecting the pipe line and the pumps that would
make the game more difficult so now you´ll have to deal with the idea of more
things to care about and then your decision have to be more effective in
managing risk.
