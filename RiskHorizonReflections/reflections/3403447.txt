Reflection

After playing the game, I felt it was effective on displaying the relationship between knowledge, protection and insurance.  It demonstrated in a simplistic way that risk management is a complicated task affected by many factors. At first I leaned more towards a defensive strategy focusing heavily on protection but I quickly saw that I needed to find a balance between the three to master the game. Moreover, I witnessed that one's strategy must be ever evolving. Each outcome is unpredictable and the results may influence one's following decisions. Perhaps you focus more on research and purchase cheaper insurance due to the heavy damage from the previous comet. Perhaps you opt to build more as your previous strategy of protection, research and insurance successfully allowed one to avoid any loss. Perhaps you buy more insurance because you observe several oncoming comets of high severity. These trade-offs are effectively demonstrated in the game play and thus the game illustrates how one must use all three skills to adapt one's community to mitigate risk.

I played the game multiple times and as I stated previously, at first I focused more on protection especially in the early stages of my community's development. However, this exhausted resources and prevented me from multi-tasking which inhibited me from building more, earning more and even buying proper insurance when needed. I adapted a more balanced plan as I became more accustomed to the game. I saw that knowledge indirectly affects protection as it gave the community time to communicate and respond properly to oncoming comets often preventing damage. This was a cost efficient way to adjust to disaster. I could build better homes. Also, with the additional resources I could purchase better insurance for the most severe of comets. Ultimately, this illustrated to me that risk management is a complex strategy that requires the proper amount of flexibility, planning and preparation. 

If I could change anything about the game, I would want to have an explanation as to why I lost a level. I did not get past level 4 but it was not clear to me why the bar was below goal. I think this would be helpful in understanding in hindsight what prevented success a scenario. For instance to apply a real life example, if I moved to a a home in new area but wasn't aware that a creek nearby floods once a year, I may not buy flood insurance because I lack knowledge about this risk. However, once disaster hits, then in hindsight I can learn from this experience and prepare for the following year. It would be helpful to know why you lose a level so that you can adjust your strategy if you opt to try again.
