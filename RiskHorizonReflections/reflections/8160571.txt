The role of risk management is to secure structures built so to have minimum damage when the comet hits. The trick is on cost for resilience versus the damage and the cost of repairing the structure. Insurance comes in as a factor which will take care of damage costs upon the risk occurring. In playing the game, I built the structures, and keep upgrading to keep up it even stronger. For insurance I decided to go for the average premium charge mainly because of the time factor and the funds available. With the time taken to prepare for the risk, development slowed down, the focus was shifted from developing new structures to protecting the two structures I had already built.Playing the game again, I would have to focus also on the comet, understand the potential effects and then be able to judge if my structures would be able to survive with minimum defects. Though the comets have chances of missing, so the resilience costs would be on judged on the available funds and the damage potential of the risk. What I picked as a lesson from the game, is that as much as development is much desired, more attention should be given to protecting already existing structures, there is a time factor attached to it, procrastinating will result to more funds being needed in repairing the structures after the comets have hit.In developing the game, first it would be a clearer description of the research, the time allocated must be clear from the information shown on the comet. The occurrence of the risk is much quicker and gives less time for critical thinking on coming up with the appropriate decision to make, so I would slow it down, give the player enough time to make well thought of decisions, putting the availability of funds in to consideration.
