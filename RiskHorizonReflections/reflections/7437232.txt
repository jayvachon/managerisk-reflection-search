I think the most important issue is priority. what we should do first and second...?what is the risk? and how much is it important? at first we should choose a strategy to build pods. there is 2 options: 1-build too many and then try to upgrade them 2- build less pods but upgrade them faster. due to resources strategy the second is better option.secondly we should decide about insurance. analyzing the risks of meteors we understand the island is a very risky zone. so insurance is very important, high level insurance is required.I played the game more than once, i chose the strategy of pods building as said before, when i was playing for second time! it reminds me it is very important and critical to investigate about the similar projects and the experiences gained by others.Due to resources high level protection needs high level income an high level pods! so we can not make a protective infrastructure in an empty island! little actions are more important at first!
