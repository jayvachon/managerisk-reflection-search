The role of risk management in the game was to  manage protection of the development  of the place , that is so important in
starting any development project  is to
balance between the development,  and
risk management implementation , this entails a question : How to distribute resources
in a way to sustain development and keeping it on going , and at the same time
putting efforts, time and money in protecting 
what is going on and as a development , this is not so easy to manage a lot
of work has to be done in order to use the best choices in the appropriate
times  in the game   while building
pods which is considered as development,  the risk coming from the space such as the
comets ,which can be defined by the risk of floods that can hit the island and
cause damages to the pods and development 
of the place if the comets hit the sea , the more you spend time in assessing
the and research about the comet's severity and probability to hit,  the more certainty is going to be  gained to take better decisions ,  the severity need to be assessed to choose the
level of protection that is going to be deployed to save the pods and the  development process of the area  , the more severity level the  of comets, entails more level of protection. While
the probability level of comets hitting the sea is important  , when the hitting probability is low and
severity is also low, more resources and investments can be used in the
development of the area , and when the hitting probability is high we need to
assess the  severity and if it was high
more resources and investments need to be directed to protection the of pods
and developments in a race of time to reach a protection level similar to
severity level minimum, here protection level is interpreted by the level of raising
up the land of development the more raise up level the more protection level is
gained , which means more protections against floods, less losses and damages ,
less resources to be deployed in case of comet hit and damages occurred, also insurance
need to be taken as preparation for the risk, insurance is considered as distribution
of resources from good to bad areas and to take part of the repair bill and the
lost development, in case of damage , the increased protection level make you
recover and repair  easier and faster,
preparation for the risk consume part of the budget on the account of
development , usually the effect of the spent budgets in risk preparation is
not visible in short term or immediately , and outcomes will be touched after
the crises by coping and recovering faster from it in less( time, efforts and budgets).i f i played the game only once, I would
differently give more attention the comets' severity and chances of hit, also I
am going to use higher insurance level, the game lessons are important , it's
nice to apply the knowledge you gained and put you in a way to take decisions,
, in the game i learn that preparation for risk is so important to protect the
development of the area and the pods the more protection means lesser time to
recover from the crisis , and less time, efforts, resources. if I were tasked
with developing a new version of the game, I will propose and change the moving
comets by a moving sun since I live in gulf region which is too hot and sun is
too strong in summer ( season ) and  in
in midday  which better represent the
risk management choices that matter in the place  i live.
