        The game is not easy, until a Luminator is
able to strike a balance between development and the 4 elements of risk
management: knowledge (research), protection, insurance, and coping (community
connections). There is always a dilemma every time while deciding on where
should one spend money and time, development or risk management?

        The first time playing
the game I was trying to build and upgrade as many pods as possible. It was
lucky enough to pass level 1 since there was only a comet with high severity,
which missed. However, no further could I go. Soon I realized that within only
3 minutes and limited resources, a one-time flooding may hinder my community
development. After trying several times, I found that in this game, research
and protection seem to be very helpful, especially the former, since it has two
significant effects: realize the threat and gain more time to create community
connections (i.e. coping). More amazing is that, research in this game is fairly
cost effective!! A net cost of $100 could let a Luminator have about 15 seconds
or more to create community connections, which could prevent from huge loss. On
the other hand, speaking of the protection, it is a little bit more expensive
but possesses long-lasting protective effect. A net cost of $150 would enable a
level-six protection, which could help one survive about half of the shocks in
a level and end up with “no damage”.

        The next thing should
be discuss is the “insurance” part, which is the most expensive option among
the three. Whether it is cost effective or not really depends on the game-level
as well as the amount and level of the pods. Also the value of insurance may
come from the uncertainty. Research and protection helps a lot, correct, but
not always. Once in a level-3 game, I have spent all my money and reached level-6
protection, while suddenly a comet with severity-level of 9 came at high speed.
Without any insurance, it totally caught me off guard. The heavy damage deprived
me all the chances to go further since it cost way too high to repair all the
pods.

        Finally I would like to add a little more about
my perspective for this game. The evaluation of development, which will be
affected more by the number of the pods existing there than by the level of
them, should be stated beforehand in order to let us focus on risk management.
However, considering a broader sense of “knowledge”, maybe this is also something
a Luminator should find out by oneself – the goal of development.
