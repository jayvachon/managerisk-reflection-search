The role of risk management was
protecting the pods from comets, which reduced development. Knowledge
(research) didn’t cost money, but it took up time. Though it increased
protection without a fee, it was only specific to that one comet, like research
into floods won’t help fight malaria. Unless it was a high-impact comet, I only
researched to the lower level of “chance” or “severity”. I tried to get my
protection into the blue because it lowered the possibility of damage from any
comet. Because of my lack of money, I couldn’t increase the protection to 10
while reaching the development goal. Insurance was about as expensive as
developing one pod. I had to remind myself that it wasn’t cost-prohibitive
because it was made up while rebuilding. 

After I failed 3 times, changing my
strategy got me to level 5. I decided to only buy insurance once, instead of
wasting the 25% fees. I had to switch from 75% insurance to 50% insurance,
since I would get hit by comets while waiting to accumulate the fee. 50% insurance
kept the cost of rebuilding down while letting me build after buying it. I also
decreased the amount of protection I was using so I could focus more on
development, but I had insurance right from the get go. (I was showing a bit of
moral hazard, but my strategy worked.) I replenished my protection after every
compact impact. I made sure I did a little research on every comet so I would
know if I needed more protection.

I would add a democratic aspect.
Each pod would have a “neglect bar”, which would decrease development if it got
too high. (i.e., if other pods were being developed more than that particular
pod, or if it was damaged for a long period of time.) This reflects the
difficulty that politicians in the United States have with the fear of being
voted out of office. Constituents whose protection is working properly forget
about disasters and start to question its value.  I often caught myself protecting too highly
after rebuilding from an impact.

I learned that it is very difficult
to allocate resources. If I had good ex ante management, I often wasn’t
developing quickly enough. I understand now why developing countries have
difficulties with risk management: their development needs demand more of their
scant resources.(I thought this was supposed to be a 400 word essay, so I edited to get it down to 400 from 550... that's why it's not 600.)
