The role of risk management is key in this game, regarding the trade off between different actions you can take and the effect that has on the outcome.  I quickly learned the importance of building the pods, after failing the first time on the second level because my meter wasn't green.  I focused too much on protection to try and prevent a meteor hit, and less on researching and trying to develop sufficient communication chains to prevent/limit the damages.  Researching comets took much less time than raising the protection level, while at the same time the protection level affected all comets and not just one at a time like research did.  To be honest, I never used insurance because the levels didn't require it.  I found that using a mixture of research and protection was sufficient to reach level 5, which was the highest that I reached.I already mentioned earlier how I changed my approach after the first time I played, namely by building and updating more pods whenever I wasn't researching or raising protection.  The second and third times I played the game, I changed my strategy accordingly and at the start of each level I built pods or updated existing ones.  I did this again at precisely halfway through each level when I had a significant amount of money saved up.  It didn't take long to do this, and after I immediately started to research and protect once again.  The main thing I learned is that all choices have a trade off.  If I spent time raising protection, that was time I couldn't spend researching the individual comets.  My strategy was to raise the protection to about 7 or 8, depending on the first group of comets, and then research each individual comet in order of landing and severity.  If a comet had a high chance to hit and a high severity, I would fully research it whenever possible.  I ended up having to connect a wireless mouse so I could perform the clicks necessary to build a communication chain faster, and this strategy seemed to work quite well.I had to think for awhile about the third part of this question, because risk management on a larger scale in a game like this isn't something I'm used to considering.  However, I liken this to a Sim City type of game, which questions the decisions that city planners make regarding public programs, zoning, planning, and other things on an urban planning level.  I think I would make the game a little more involved, with a goal of making a successfully growing city.  Similar to this game, there would be tradeoffs involved, but more in the game I would create.  The city planner would have to decide on an infrastructure system, where to place residential/industrial/commercial zones, what government programs would be in place, etc.  The main restriction would be the total budget, which can be increased by citizens by an amount depending if they are commercial/industrial/residential.  It's hard to completely lay out the entire premise of a game in 200-300 words that I had left after answering the first 2 parts, but it would be a more realistic tradeoff involving financial decisions that actually affect a real city.  Real cities don't have only 3-4 choices as in the game we played for the assignment, there are many more that they have to balance.
