Risk management was an important aspect of the game. Outright development without consideration of the impending disasters causes huge losses. The major point is that money in stagnant form does nor help, Money has to be utilized in development or insurance, money shouldn't be kept idle. Research levels play an important role in decreasing the aftershocks. There has to be a minimum research level for all comets irrespective of the 'chance of hit'. Comets can hit even though the 'chance of hit' is low. As described in the lecture, behavioral tendencies are seen in such scenarios. Overconfidence can cause huge harm to life and property. Most of the damage can be avoided by raising the height. In risk management, all aspects have to be developed at a constant rate. Even if a single aspect is lagging behind, it will cause major damage. Time management was very necessary. Research levels can be increased while money increases and development is taking place. Height should also be kept at a higher value. Insurance of fifty percent is a must.I played the game more than once. The most important thing i learnt was that the community need not be huge. Having small communities and developing the said communities to higher levels is better on the whole. Initially, I did not give enough importance to the research levels. In the later games, it proved to be the deciding factor for damage control. Time management improved with the number of games played. In the initial games, I chose maximum insurance. Later I realized that if preparation levels are higher then lower insurances will also do. In the later games the main aim was to reach further levels whereas in the initial games, the aim was to reach a hundred percent on each level. In other words, it is important to move forward with whatever is available than be stuck in one place trying to gain small improvements.My suggestion for improving the game would be multitasking, there should be an option of increasing research levels as well as raising or developing. This can be conducted at slower speeds. It will give emphasis on human resource management. Add percentage option, where the user can decide the percentage of human resource which will be used for one task, e.g. sixty percent can work on raising the height and forty percent can work on the research. The raising time will increase by 1.66 times whereas raising time will increase by 2.5 times. This will give a more realistic approach to risk management.
