1.  The primary objective is Development, which is required to pass the level.  The Risk Management options (that use up resources that could otherwise be allocated for Development) are:  a) Research,  b) Insurance and  c) Protection (by raising the community).  Research is not too costly and is required in order to gain Knowledge about the severity (of damage) and likelihood (of impact) of incoming Comets.  The primary trade-off then is between using Resources for Development (primary objective) and raising the community's level of Protection (which takes time as well as resources).  2.  After the first time i no longer bothered with Insurance unless there was a very severe (potentially damaging) incoming comet and i could not raise Protection against it in time.  Instead my general strategy was to maximize Development of the pods, and raise the level of Protection when resources were insufficient for building or upgrading, thus using time wisely.  3.  First i would ensure that a game (or any other planned component of a course) were thoroughly beta (outside) tested and debugged before deployment.  That being said, at this point (I hear the game is still being tweaked) I would probably lower the cost (or escalation of the cost) of Insurance, as the high prices make the option superfluous, or at best a desperation choice. This would more closely reflect the insurance options we have here where I live.
