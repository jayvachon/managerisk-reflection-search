The game
allows you to develop a community that faces only one type of risk, comets. To
pass the level you need to balance the research, prevention and the ability to
deal with the disaster in order to minimize the damage. 

When the
risk happens, the comet hits the community; the game puts to the test
preparation in order to prevent the risk, research and construction of
barriers, our ability to react to events, mini-game, to calculate damages. Also
taking out insurance, we can reduce the damage. 

Limited
resources force us to balance the three aspects and influence the choices that
you can make. On more than one occasion a wrong choice in balancing the aspects
of the game has led to fail the goal, for example, a wrong assessment of the
level of insurance after the disaster will not have time to recover or too high
level of insurance consumers taking away too many resources from the development.

Playing I
realized the difficulty of balancing resources and how even one small margin of
error in this balance can lead to a disaster.

The new
feature want to add is a new risk: the corruption. In the country where I live
is widespread and poses a serious obstacle to economic development and resource
management. In fact, corruption rise two types problems, the citizens' mistrust
of the authorities and the construction of poor infrastructure and thus more
damage in cases such as natural disasters or just in case of collapse of the
infrastructure built.
