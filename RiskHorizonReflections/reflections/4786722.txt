The role of risk management in the game is to evaluate and process the information base on the data that was given and make timely decision on what is best for the community of Alora in order to prosper and thrive. The choices I made and trade off that I confronted are based on the data of the meteors particularly on the chances of being hit and the severity of the impact. Using the throve of information I was able to purchase more insurance so that I would be better protected  and  raise the ground to prevent further damage.  Using these knowledge I was able to have further development of the pods and enhanced the community.  The preparation for risk affect development came in immediately after the first impact of the meteor that caused a severe damage on the pods.  I played the game multiple times and as I go along though different levels I was able to learn based on what I did wrong that created the most damage.With the additional knowledge and experience, I was able to balance and prioritize what should  I do first and to implement the proper action to manage the risk.  If I'am tasked to develop a new game  on risk management I would suggest that the game to be presented in a more realistic way instead of outer space. I would present  maybe an island  community is threatened by global warming and as a result of the drastic changes in weather, it is threatened by big waves or tsunamis for example so that the player would know what is at stake and be able to relate on problem that would like happen in our world.
