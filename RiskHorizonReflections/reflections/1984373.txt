The role of the risk management in the game was to build up sustainable village community. The houses had to be upgraded in order to reach higher profit, but at the same time the island had to be protected against natural disasters. I tried to evaluate the risk of each comet by reaching minimal research level. If the possibility of damage was low, I invested my resources into upgrading  houses or building new ones. It does take some time, so until new resources were generated, I came back to research of the comet, in order to gain time for making connections (this seems to be the easiest way of protection, since it doesn`t cost any resources. If the the probability of damage was high, I spend the resources on insurance and raising the island. In that case, the preparation for the risk was delaying the development.When I played the game the first time, I didn`t pay much attention into research. I build up massive protection, but then the resources were missing elsewhere and the growth of the village decreased. The second mistake I made, was investing too much money to upgrade the houses, but I was not building new ones.Then their maintenance become costly after catastrophe, and it took a long time to "regenerate" from the economical point of view. The main thing I learned from the game would be the necessity of balance. It is impossible to focus on one or two aspects, but the development has to approached in complex way.If I should change something in the game, I would add a measurement of the income speed of houses. Like this it is difficult to evaluate and compare the options for building new houses or developing existing ones.
