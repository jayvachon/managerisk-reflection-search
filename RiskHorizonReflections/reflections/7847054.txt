1) In the game you have to balance opportunity, constructing and improving pods, and risk, invensting in knowledge (research), protection (matching the severity of comets with the level of protection) and insurance (buying insurance). The trade-off is not only beetween risk and opportunity, but also beetween the three different risk management tools. You need a cost-effective combination of protection (to neutralize low and middle severity comets), knowledge (to know comets' severity and to face short-term risks, gaining more time to create connections in the Community) and insurance Â (to reduce the damage of middle and high severity comets and to reduce the decrease of development). The Power of Protection is the long-term prevention tool, so it lasts between a round and the other, but it's cost is increasing with the level of protection. In case of emergency (high severity comet incoming). The key is to increase it in order to focus on development and only in high risk cases (high severity comets) manage the short-term treat. Knowledge (research) is important to do the right short-term decision. It's also important to keep a sufficient buffer of "money" to be flexible.2) I played the game many times and in the last games I tried to prevent (combining protection and research) rather than be short-sighted (rely on insurance and focus too much on developing. I learned that:Long-term risk management is fundamental to have a sustainable growthWhere the preparation (prevention) is not enough you have to be ready to cope with short-term, but programmed, action3) I think that the comets in this game are too predictable (by the color, by the fact that you see them on the horizon). An earthquake, for example, is not so predictable. So I'd like to see a game where the risk has very low predictability.
