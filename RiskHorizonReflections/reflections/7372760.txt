In the ‘week 2 risk management game’ we have observed that
the game is about controlling; better to say managing risk. This is not the
only thing we have performed in the game. In the ‘risk management game’ comets
fall in the site that causes the severe damage. The intensity of the damages is
different based on the three parameters. If we become unable to avoid risk, we
have to repair the construction and take an extra care for the development of
site. For the rebuilding purpose we have to need the money again. In these cases
we can purchase insurance to get the coverage of damages.  There are three types of insurance you van
bye based on the percentage of coverage. In my point of view it is best to buy
the high amount of insurance. Though you have to pay more for it, still you high
amount of coverage for it which will help you to rebuild the construction. And
the most interesting thing in the Game is that we have to perform the whole
task within a certain period of time.

I have played the game several times. I didn’t succeed in
the first few attempts. So I used different technique in each round of the ‘risk
management game’. I have done the tutorial of the game for better
understanding.  When I played the actual
game I used different process for the experiment also to see which takes lesser
time and which is beneficial for too. Time limit was the most different barrier
for me. The frequency of hitting comets was too high which causes severe
damages and main threats for the development. After the first time I started using
the research for avoiding the severity and risk of comet falling on the earth.
This attempt was quite functional. Beside this, I purchased the highest
available insurance which helps me to get coverage after the damage of the
site. It reduced the burden of money and serviceable for reconstruction too. The
main thing I learned from the game that it is very necessary to do the
insurance and taking proper care is the most useful way.

I feel in the game that the time period of this game quite
short. Those who are not very comfortable with playing video games; this would
be the difficult for them. So I would like to increase the time-limit.

The first of all research is required for understanding the probable
risk which can attack you. This will partially help you to avoid the loss in a
high extend. Further option or scope to have compensation should be available
if any case we have to face catastrophe. This factor will help you to overcome
the crisis. Proper planning and not losing hope is one of the most important things
in my point of view.
