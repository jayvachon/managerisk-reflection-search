1.       The role of risk management in this
game was to allow us to limit damage the best we could while keeping a good development
rate. 

Preparing for risk can affect development if we
want to prepare too much and spend too much money regarding the risk. If we do
that, we won’t have money left to develop more and to have better ways to
prevent risks. 

In return, a good preparation for risk can
allow us to keep a correct rate of development and, avoiding important damages,
the development won’t slow down too much.

2.       I played the game three times. The
first time, I was focusing a lot on risks and not at all on development. The
second time, I tried to spend less money in preparing for risk and on insurance
to ensure a good development rate. The third time, I tried to manage more
efficiently the preparation regarding the risks. I tended to spend a lot of
money trying to have no damage at all but I realize it was not realistic.

The game
taught me that preparing for a risk involves a good knowledge of the risk and
that we always need to make sacrifices and make the better of the worst
situation. All is about moderation and balance. 

3.       I think the role of people is not
involved enough in the game. Protection, with infrastructure and insurance are
well represented and their role are quite accurate but knowledge of inhabitants
are not. I think the game leaves out the role of prevention towards citizens
too blurred. As it takes place on a community scale, I would think it is quite
important to mention not only equipment damage but physical as well. But as the
game simplified the notion of risk management it seems difficult to embrace all
aspects while keeping it simple and easy to reach.
