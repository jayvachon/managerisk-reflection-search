1. The risk
management has a crucial role in the game, because we must choose a combination
between Knowledge (asteroid danger), Insurance (for better reconstruction) and
Protection (keeping green level) in order to be prepared before the asteroid
impact and minimize the effects. This is a typical risk chain.

My choice
was to build (and reconstruct) as soon as possible, but always with the higher
insurance. At the same time I was monitoring the asteroid danger and was afraid
with the level of protection. Higher risk (lower insurance , lower knowledge of
asteroid danger , or lower protection) always conducted to loss the level
because I could not be able to rebuild in time. It was better an intermediate
option to  develop the game.



2. My first
time was frustrating, but however I enjoyed next times. I did´t pass level two,
but I can learn some lessons fron the experience.

I
learned that the best option was always using a certain level of insurance, and
that  I must rebuild as soon as possible
after impacts. Knowledge from asteroid danger was useful, but protection was
more useful. 

3. I don´t
use to play video games. It was hard to me the way to reinforce constructions,
linking together, after impacts. I acknowledge and congratulate the creators of
the game, because the simpler it will be more useful for those not usually
play. The game is a fun good job. 

If I had to
propose a change, my advice was to improve the instructions, expanding them, in
order to help people not familiar with video games.
