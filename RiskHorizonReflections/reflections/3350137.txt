Role Of Risk Management in Game

 

In game we have to use a balance between research, insurance
and protection. It gave us practical simulation of how to give attention to
which thing most.

 

Strategy used by me in game

Level 1 –my
whole attention was on development and protection I did not used insurance
since the level of risk was protected by in in advance.

Level-2 –
in this level again my particular attention was on research and development since
the problem could be mitigated by spending time on protection.

Level-3-
again I used the same strategy but this time I was hit by Metroid it decreased
my development level but I managed to get it.

Level 4 -I
purchased insurance this time and spend less money on protection since I was
ensured my development does not go down even after getting   attacked
by Metroid. For getting more time for mitigation I spend time on research.

Level 5-
same strategy matching up development with level spending money on protection
as well as insurance.

Level 6 cannot complete it.

 

If I play next time I will send more on protection less on insurance.


I understand how it is good to be prepared for disaster by
all ways i.e. protection as well as insurance.

 

Change I will propose to better represent the risk
management choices that matter in the place I live will be to make it a hilly terrain
so that ability to take decision depending on location of settlement also
effect so that people could understand that development is necessary but in a scientifically
planned way.
