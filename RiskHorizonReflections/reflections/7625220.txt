The role of risk management in the game was to have a successful construction with less risk taken, in term of knowledge, protection, and insurance i focused on research, because in research there are lots of knowledge that can be gained, which means you are knowledgeable of the threats or risks faced with in the execution of your duties, in knowledge there is also protection, without research you wouldn't  know how to protect, where to protect, and what to protect cause protection is very expensive and is not hundred percent(100%).I also realized that insurance was very important in the process, that with out insurance you alone can not covered up damages cause by comets, risk has to be mitigated not absorbing it alone.I played more than once and what i did different was to increased my research and protection while i gradually erect structures to improve my community. I realize that each time i focused on protection, construction slows down points remains stagnant  and that lead me to losing the game, at first my attention was only protection rather than focusing on all at the same time which was very difficult for me to do but later i started coping with the game pattern thou i did not reach far in the process but getting the concert was essential to me.     If i am given a responsibility to change or add to the game, I think  i would preferred to make one simple change rather than adding.The  change i am going to make to the game is going to be base on the game time, especially when you are raising your community level is just adding protecting to your community the game point bar turns red like which slow the points while the time continue to run, that does not seem fair to me, probably because i never understood that portion of the game well or because i never went far in the game, i also notice that when you are researching the score bar goes up and don't passed its previous stage, with the globe in which we live time is very much essential to development, with the delay in the time makes the game a little different when we try to compare with a real life scenario. where i live is underdeveloped, and a poor nation but time is taken into serious consideration for the development of our households, community and state.
