1)The game has an inbuilt system wherein one can find the
chances if a comet is going to hit or not and what would be the severity of the
hit. This gives the user a change to manage the risk. The user can conduct a
research every time since the comet shows on the horizon. 

The list on the comet gives the player an idea about the
severity of hit and chances of the comet hitting. This gives the player a
chance to build a strategy in terms of research and protection . A comet having
no chance of a hit can be avoided and the resources can be directed to the
building of pods.

2)I played the game several times. In the first go I could
not save the pods, hence I just enumerated the mistakes I made in that turn. In
the subsequent turns,

·        
I researched the comet as and when it appeared
on the horizon. This gave me chance to protect my pods after the comet had hit.
In the first turn, I concentrated on building the pods majorly. This kept the
ticker green but a hit is all it takes. So in order to have some protection
time after the hit, I used the research ticker in the game. Hence in the turns I
took at the game, I learnt to hedge the risk by knowing the details and chances
of a comet’s hit

·        
I bought insurance just well in advance so that
at end if I don’t have enough resources to buy insurance I should get into any
kind of trouble. Insurance reduces the anticipatory damages that are caused by
these comets. An insurance helped me a lot in subsequent turns I took. It
reduced amount of resources needed for the rebuilding of pods. This helped me
in keeping the ticker green.

·        
To hedge the risk I protected my  pods by raising the level of the land.
