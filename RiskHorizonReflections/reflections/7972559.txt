In playing the game, I took a couple of attempts to
understand the interconnecting conditions to pass the first level. I would
surmise that understanding risk management for this type of environment is
important and with that comes trial and error to create the right conditions. 

 

There were times when I was learning that I didn’t react in
time nor did I find the most optimum set of solutions. When I was able to sort
it out, the next level changed the dynamic again and I couldn’t use the same
processes. I really felt like I was blindly taking steps that I thought would
help and couldn’t predict the outcome. Trial and error could help, however it
does take a significant amount of time, the conditions need to be similar for
it to work the next time and I consumed resources that I many not need to if I
was better at the game. 

 

If I was allowed to change one simple thing it would be to
have a game/job aid providing examples of what worked well in the past. These
can be in the form of research, other planets in similar situations or outcomes
that have occurred that I should take into account.  There may not be easy solutions to play all
levels of the game, however collective experience/knowledge to gain the best
outcomes in this game would have been appreciated.
