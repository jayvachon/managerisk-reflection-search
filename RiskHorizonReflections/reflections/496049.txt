[1] Role, choices and the effect of preparation for risk on developmentThe role of risk management in the game is to learn to act proactively to prevent the possibly loss in face of foreseeing uncertainties (comets might hit) while reaching development goal by either building new pods and upgrading current pods.The proactive measures of this game includes buying insurance, investing in protection and increasing the knowledge of comets such as severity, chances of hit and researching.In level 1, I built a few pods and buy the insurance immediately. After that I stopped building pods and turn to invest in protection to 1/2 of the protection bar. For comets, I missed most of them but I got hitted by a few, luckily my invest in protection kept my pods safe. Because I invested heavily in protection, the rate of the development meter progressed slowly. I barely passed level 1.For level 2 to 6, I kept building newer pods, upgrade current ones while investing heavily on protection (at least 2/3 of protection bar and full protection in level 6) and sometimes observing the comets. This strategy paid off, I developed faster later on as I am protected and eventually I was able to pass level 6.[2] I played this game only once. If I have the chance to play it again, I won't change my strategy of investing heavily on protection. The main thing I learned from the game is that, preparation for risk really matters, although it slows down development a bit, but it is worth-doing because it kept my pods from the damage of comets in both short and long term.[3] If I was allowed to change or add one simple thing, this would be the ability to add one more type of risk and corresponding preparation. This could be typhoon or earthquake and the ability to predict it . For preparation, that could be early warning and the ability to make protection for pods beforehand.
