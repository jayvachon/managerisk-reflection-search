In the Risk Horizon game, the risk management significantly contributed to Alora’s development. Risk management allowed the community of Alora to not only gain information about the comets and prepare against the waves the comets caused but also allowed them to cope with the post-hit damages. Preparation against risks acted as a tool for Alora’s economic progress as it helped Alora to build resilience and achieve prosperity. It allowed Alora to pursue opportunities through building and upgrading plots and helped to decrease the probability of damages through research and protection. Gaining insurance also enhanced the ability of Alora to recover from these negative shocks. This led to higher development in Alora. To manage the risks, I concentrated more on protection and research and a little less on insurance. Protection level was almost at all times above five. For comets with high severity and high chances of hit, I researched a lot to create more and more time for community connections. I also opted for 25% insurance option. Gaining knowledge by researching had the opportunity cost of time and money that could have been spent to increase protection levels. Similarly, increasing protection meant foregoing the alternative of purchasing 50% insurance option. Playing the game more than once allowed me to learn and hence, alter my strategies. Initially, I focused solely on protection and insurance, especially the latter. After carefully analyzing the situation in Alora, I made considerably more use of the protection and research tools than insurance. Building and upgrading plots and researching about the comets before hand provided me ample time to create community connections, which lead to very little or mostly no damage after a hit. By keeping protection levels high, generally over and above five, I was able to improve the resilience of Alora’s community against its risks. Playing the game has sharpened my risk management skills. It has greatly helped me to practically use the knowledge gained so far in the course. It gave me an opportunity to strategically think and act as a public policy maker and allowed me to witness, in a way, the process of risk management in real world. Playing the game more than once allowed me to analyze the results of my initial choices and then to alter my choices accordingly. Similarly, even while playing the game, I changed my strategies a bit after a comet had hit Alora. This helped me to understand how in the real world public decision makers adjust their policies with time.Pakistan is a developing country located in the continent Asia. Primary sector contributes around 24% to Pakistan’s GDP and employs 44% of total labor force. More than half of our exports are agricultural products. Hence, our economic performance is significantly related to climatic conditions and harvests. More than 5 floods have occurred in Pakistan in just the past ten years, making floods the most feared risk for both the public and private sector. This has made farmers reluctant to invest in High Yield Variety (HYV) seeds. Damages by floods and low-quality seeds have hindered development and also caused increased rural-urban migration, a worsening balance of payments deficit, higher unemployment and alarming crime rates. A change in Risk Horizon game that I would like to propose is that instead of comets, I would like floods to be the shock. Chance of hit would mainly depend on rainfall. Game player would look at the chance of flood and set the protection and insurance levels accordingly. I certainly think that such a change would better represent the risk management choices made in my country Pakistan.
