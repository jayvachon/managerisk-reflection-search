Playing an online game on risk management is a fun and learning. In this game I tried many times my risk management abilities.The role of risk management was very crucial in mitigating the effects of the comets hitting the shells and then causing the damage . I used my credits at level1 to have a at least 5 shells as soon as possible and buy an insurance to cover them . I kept on monitoring every comet even though it had a cost associated to it. But spending 5 points was worth for planning to make a new shell of have enough credits to rebuild the structures after they have been hit . I bought the insurance for 75% coverage and tried best to dilute the effect into the community and lowering the damage . There were lot of trade off every time I played the game . I made the deal between insurance and ground lift. Each time I varied the number of shells and their upgrade.I tried having a second level upgrade in level1 but it was not worth it.I had to suffer losses in the later stage due to high renovation cost of the upgraded builds.I played the game more than once , each time I tried to have Â different options of insurance and tried different numbers of shells at the level1 but the most effective was the coverage for 75% of the damage.While playing on the level2 , I used to watch the comets for having secured the credits to rebuild. I already had a lifted ground for the shells so the loss was lesser as compared to non-lifted cases.I learnt that knowledge of the risk and having enough resources to mitigate it are two very important aspects. One has to secure some funds for damage control and historical data should be matched with current situations to find out what actually is the leading way of trend. When risks have a higher probability , its always wise to have more insurance coverage.As a game programmer , I would have added a few more widgets to monitor the intensity of the comets.This would have helped the user to capture the information just before the event , This the basic idea behind any risk aversion activity in every system . Added to it, I would have provided some more time to build the shells again , in case it was hit in last 20 seconds.There could have been a functionality to allow user to connect the shells with credit exchange method so that they can start a rebuild process, If there is a fund available.
