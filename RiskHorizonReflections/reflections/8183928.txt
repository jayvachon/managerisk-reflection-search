Risk
management is a process that involves confronting risk, preparing for them and
coping with their effects. A risk is here understood as a possibility of
loss. I have learned that risk management is all about allocating
resources in the best possible way. You simply cannot have it all. In the game,
it is a tradeoff between protection (action to prevent negative shocks),
insurance (transfer resources from good to bad times) and knowledge (increased
information about risks). The role of risk management is to prevent damage and
help developing the city. Risk management might sound easy but making the right
choice is not that simple - in fact, sometimes it is all about luck. 

I
played the game several times and made it to level five. In the game, you face
a systemic risk, which can shock the world negatively. The game is all about
finding the perfect balance between knowledge, insurance and protection. It
took me time to realize that insurance played an important role and that you
often buys it when it is too late. Furthermore, I have learned that short-term
solutions are not always the best choice. It might be attractive to develop the
city at all cost but failing at buying protection and insurance will result in
massive damage, and coping with it is expensive.

In
the game, you are able to see and follow the comet until it hits. In the real
world, natural disaster appears out of nowhere. Not knowing when it strikes
makes risk management much more difficult. At that point, the game is not a
realistic picture of risk management.
