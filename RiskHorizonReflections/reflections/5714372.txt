1. Reflections on choices and trade-offs 

Risk management affected how well prepared for shocks my
planet was and how well it coped when comets hit. Insurance helped pay for
damage - so it was a solid investment (the feedback at the end of a round
showed how much it saved me). I found that the time spend on knowledge
gathering (monitoring the comets) paid off in the time I had to build social
networks (I think that's what the flashes between the hubs were). I found it
hard to measure the impact of lifting up the village (I assume it was
protection) but I think that focusing on protection meant I had to trade off
the knowledge collection (monitoring the comets). I realise that the game is
meant to simulate the complexity of the real world but I found there was a lot
happening at once and despite having done the tutorial it was a lot to follow.

2. Learnings from different attempts

I played it a few times - to be honest I still don't
understand why I lost each round. I focused more on Â research the second time as I learned that it
gave me more time to respond to the comets (more time to click on the flashing
hubs). The third time didn't invest as much in infrastructure thinking that it
would be cheaper to repair (I theorised that is why I lost the rounds - I ran
out of money?). I think the game was trying to convey the value of insurance,
knowledge and protection in being better able to cope with shocks like comets.
Sometimes it was tempting to just wait to see if the comet would hit - but
researching the comet led to better outcomes.

3. New element

Maybe to better capture coping with climate change there
could be an element of growing food. Food production is very susceptible to
risk, with variables such as rainfall, food prices and the like have a huge
impact on farmers livelihoods. Farmers make very real decisions around risk
management all the time - what to plant, when to plant, how much, wether to get
credit to plant more.
