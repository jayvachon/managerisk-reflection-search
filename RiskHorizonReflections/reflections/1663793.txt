On my personal opini√≥n this game provides good alternatives of how people can be adverse or not to the risk and how can them face under determined circumstances or even when there is no certainty of something happened. Personally I played it twice,On first time I did not understand the rules and the rle of the decisions I should take. On the other side on second time, I realized how one decison can affect in a short or long-term others. For instances I reached on third level but being with more production, less time I have been accumulating for a quickly reaction and the game was over.Another learning brought on this is to realice which priorities oneself consider the best and which strategies shoud afford in order to reach the final goal, even to as more advance, harder become the game with a higher level of risk.Other interesting point is that during the journey oneself would et a btter knowledge of the environment and how for example can affect the place if it is a collision of a comet and how we should be prepared for future impacts. These decisions will allow somebody to develop a manual or a procedure of action under these circumstances and how everybody should react before a collision arrives.
