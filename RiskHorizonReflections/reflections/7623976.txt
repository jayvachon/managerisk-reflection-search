1. The role of risk management was to minimize the loss  due  to risk through protection, research and insurance. in terms of cost-benefit their was a choice to be made because for receiving a particular benefit you need to incur some costs.The act of preparation plays a major role in providing for the risk, if we prepare well before hand, it will cover up some upcoming losses, through research we can identify the risk causing elements and insure it accordingly. If we have proper knowledge of the risk then we can mitigate a loss but their is a cost involved, a risk-return tradeoff is here in terms of money.2.I played the game twice. I think i have to analyze the risk properly and then provide for it.Blindly doing the task is a waste of time and resources.The main things which i learned was that we have to analyze the intensity and keep on doing our research and also we should be realistic and provide for the foundations.We should try to find out the right incentive to manage risk properly.3. I would suggest to do a thorough research about the cause of the risk and elements involved and have a thorough cost-benefit analysis. The society as a whole should come up and take the responsibility to look after risk management. Take the example of Chile, because of the awareness and the governments people their risk was minimized to some extend though the intensity of earthquake was very high, managing risk is not the responsibility of only the government but the public too are equally involved and they should also take measures for the same.
