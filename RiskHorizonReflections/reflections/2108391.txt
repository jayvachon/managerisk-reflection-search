.Risk management is  a
very important technique  to protect
against the risk which may arise in the future. This game taught me that we
should protect ourselves against any future risk in advance so that we can
mitigate  the risk up to some extent. We should
take various measure to protect ourselves against the risk such as taking
insurance  as it is also mentioned in the
game because insurance is imperative. Risk management is helpful for healthy development.Risk Management aims to facilitate the exchange of information and expertise across countries and across disciplines. Its purpose is to generate ideas and promote good practice for those involved in the business of managing risk. All too often assessments of risk are crudely made and the consequences of getting things wrong can be serious, including lost opportunities, loss of business, loss of reputation and even life. In order to protect against the risk we should analyses the cause of risk. We
should also identify the severity of risk. And also analyses the chances of its
effects .if we are able to analyses all this this things we can mitigate the risk.
The main aim of this game is to create awareness about the risk management and
make the people aware about the importance of risk management. the one of the best
thing which I got to know that risk management reduces  the losses which arises due to risk. We
should create awareness  and teach about
the risk management to every uneducated and rural people because these people
are badly affected due to  various
natural disasters as we learned in the video. From this course ,I am learning that:
To get the knowledge about the risk management and spread it in each and every
city to each and every  people of this
world because life is very precious.:The value of risk management should be known by each and every person. we should identify the risk,assess the risk,evaluate the risk and control the risk. AT LAST I WANT TO SAY  SAVE PEOPLE SAVE WORLD.
