The role of risk management in the game was to encourage balanced progress in developing your colony. It was a trade-off between developing rapidly and growing your colony with speed and researching the meteors and deciding on insurance and protection
by elevation. Too much protection slowed down development and too little caused damage and delay. The optimum was to build quickly while monitoring and adjusting. Insurance became less needed if research was done. I accidently ran on and played a second
time. I took more measured risk with the meteors and developed faster while trying to maintain a green bar as much as was feasible. My main learning was I tend to insure and protect against risk until I had a strong understanding of the effect of my actions.
Then I try to maintain a productive balance while increasing development and opportunities where possible. My new version of the game would have the addition of a negative impact on neglecting the community and building. If ignored it just stood still
and this would not reflect well mine or most communities. The pods not developed should have shown deterioration after a suitable period of time.
