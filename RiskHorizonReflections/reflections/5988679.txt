It is necessary to balance resource utilization in terms of time devoted to Research, and money dedicated to Protection, Development, and Insurance. We have to take into account all fronts simultaneously. We cannot forget development, and dedicate all resources to insurance or protection. When economic resources are not enough, we need to dedicate time to Research. Preparation for risk is key, to the extent that we invest in Research, Protection, and insurance early enough, we can protect investments in development and prevent damages.

We have to optimize time and economic resources. It is key to invest in protection early enough and get insurance to protect early phases of development, once this has been done do research to see if additional investments in protection are required, in parallel work on development according to budget availability.

I would include up front information about development costs (unitary pod costs, repairs, enhancements) in order to plan properly the investment strategy. Also it is important to know, up front, the rationale behind availability of economic resources, the mechanism by which they become available. Time availability and constraints are clear from the outset of the game, but not budget availability.
