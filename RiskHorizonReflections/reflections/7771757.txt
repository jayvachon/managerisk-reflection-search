I think that the Risk Horizon game was a good form of exercise of using risk management in practice. It covered all of the components of risk management, from preparation to coping. It seemed easy at the beginning, having a set amount of money is easy to concentrate only on building and development. In my opinion the most important thing is to find a balance between spendings on development and protection. One of the crucial trade-offs was to put development on hold for a moment in order to gain money for insurance. But it payed off. When disaster occurred it was much cheaper and faster to rebuilt, that proves the importance of insurance. It was similar with protection, thanks to the better protection effects were less painful. Gaining knowledge proved to be necessary to asses the risk and decide whether to put money in development or in protection/saving money in case of damages. In my case putting development on hold when big risk occurred and concentrating back on development right after the risk proved to be the most efficient strategy.The first time I played I made an experiment - I concentrated only on development, not thinking about risk management. At first development was very fast, what is obvious if spending all of the founds on expansion. But only up to a point. When crisis occurred the effects were catastrophic and rebuilding practically impossible. What I learned was that not in every case the fast development is the best way to go. In order to have stable and safe development risk management is a key. Every next time I played the game again I spent more money on protection and insurance in an early faze and put bigger interest in gaining knowledge. Sufficient knowledge was necessary to asses which aspect was more important in the specific moment of the game - concentrating on development or on protection. Only thanks to that I was able to reach next and next level in the game. Another important thing that I learned from the game was that to put as much effort as possible into protection, not only in insurance. Insurance helps to rebuilt after the crisis, but protection is crucial for minimizing expected damages, what then enables faster recovery. The better preparation (covering all of the aspects: knowledge, protection and insurance) the better development was. In order to better represent risk management in the other version of the game I would add policy/economic issues as a possible crisis, f. ex., issue of inflation, higher credit rates or governmental crisis.  I live in Europe that was hit by a financial crisis not so far ago and still is regaining stability. Coping measures were taken both in area of economics and politics (changes in governments). In my opinion adding a dose of political and financial instability would create a full profile of risk management.
