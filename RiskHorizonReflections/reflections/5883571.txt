The Risk Horizon
game is an intelligent game that creates a sense of balance between gaming
strategy and real life situation. The game keeps you thinking of all the
parameters of risk and how it affects people if you do not act. Risk is and oft-avoidable
phenomenon and we are often entangled with it. Since we cannot avoid risk, we
can brace ourselves up to manage it! Throughout the game, I learnt that
managing for risk is not just important, but wise. As I played the game, I found
it difficult to maintain a balance between management of my community’s risk
and maintaining a healthy protection of my community at the same time. It seemed
a great challenge and brought to my mind that often times the issues we see as
so easy for society to handle are much more hectic and expensive. Nevertheless,
we cannot afford to sit quietly and watch as the threat of risks always looms
around us. From hunger to poor health; to natural disasters; to lack of access
to education and several other calamitous issues, the game teaches us that the
only remedy to manage risk is to research, prepare, protect and in the case
where we are hit my disaster, we rebuild. 

As we have
learned along the course, risk management cannot continue to be overlook; and
it has to be focused on with great sense of research, awareness preparedness. The
game also teaches us to be prepared for the worst and hope for the best (since
some times the comets do miss!). For societies in developing countries, risk
management should be a major component of national planning and development because
they are the ones cut up in the midst of all the worst form of disastrous
happenings. Being a decision maker in the strategizing, planning and management
of my community during the game, I realize that the process of management for
risk is important. As such, to put societies in the position to address some of
the major challenges that affect them, risk management not only becomes important,
but also inevitable!
