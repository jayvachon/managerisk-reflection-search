Risk management play a significant role in the game
due to the issue of severity and the high probability of the effect of the
comets. We have to confront with the trade-offs among investment in research,
protection or insurance. This preparation really affect immediately the development
as it costs capitals, times. With the limitation of time before risk happen, we
have to decide where we should invest money on: development; research;
protection or purchasing insurance. And even for insurance, we have to quickly
to decide which package is suitable for each situation, given the information
about the risk.As I played several time, the method that I choose to manage the risk was really changed time by time, which certainly caused the result
is better. Henceforth, there were some lessons I gained from the game in the way of thinking and acting for risk management, such as (1) the more
we spend on research, the more we become pro-active in risk management as we
have more time as well as more accurate information about the severity as well as the probability of the risk; (2) the cost for protection
are always less then cost for repair because the damage may cause the domino
effects, and in real life it even cause the loss of human life; (3) we should strongly consider the information about the risk before
buying the insurance package, otherwise we could invest too much on insurance
and run out of resource to develop.



In general. the game is really imitate the risk management model
in our real life, which’s certainly interesting the players to join the game and  then act similar
to actual, and finally teach the participants many basic but also very important lessons about
risk management. However to better represent the risk management choices, I
would like to suggest 2 things: (1) add some other type of risk rather then
only type of comet risk in the case; for example the risk that the player
choose to face as it could bring many opportunity (get more energy from
touching the comets, etc..); (2) for each place to build up the pod could have
different level of threaten so that the players have to think where is the
optimal place to build the pods in order.
