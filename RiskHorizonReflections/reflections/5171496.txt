The role of risk management is a key issue to save populations and infrastructure. With a well designed risk management strategy that articulates several actors playing strategic roles, it is more feasible to obtain optimal results.
Playing this game more than once allows us to learn more and how to build strategies to minimize negative impacts or to cope in better ways; it also implies resilience. You learn how to avoid losses and negative impacts by “investing” in research and in insurance alternatives. These two key issues are relevant for surviving.
In a new version of the game I will suggest to add the participation of public institutions, international community, the enterprise sector, the financial system and the households in the design of strategies to a better risk management. For example adding the option of creating jobs or creating a board to research and articulate policies and roles for risk management will give the game new choices for coping and resilience. Win additional point if you buil positive social capital when you save lives or reach a better preparation to confront risks.
