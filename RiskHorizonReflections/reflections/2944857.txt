1.The aim of this game was to build and protect a colony against comet attacks.Three tools were at our disposal: knowledge, protection and insurance.Knowledge in the form of research about the comets (by clicking on the comet position) gave us more accurate information about the comet impact and the likelihood of that happening.Insurance helped by making it cheaper to rebuild the colony units after a hit.protection in terms of raising the sea wall to protect against the waves could be done by holding the button on the right bottom.all the above steps cost time and money and came in the way of actual development of the colony , this is the essential trade-off.preparation for risk slowed down development (e.g. we would be clicking on the build wall feature which would not let us build more colony units, and more units could also not be built during repairs after a hit), both ex post and ex ante.research took up time and money and was a costly but necessary affair.insurance cost money as well, but was helpful in partial damage recovery.2. i played the game multiple times.i learnt that protection before the event was important in saving time. also, buying insurance is a one time job and saved a lot of effort after a hit in rebuilding.since Im risk averse, I would propose always buying insurance at some cost to the colony development pace.of course, more research helps up make this decision better, but also costs money.so the best route i propose is : buy insurance always, keep building the wall until the hit happens and hope for the best after that (in terms of damage).3. I would propose early warning systems for tsunami (since i live near the coastline), also better disaster preparedness through mock evacuation drills.both the above steps are forms of protection.
