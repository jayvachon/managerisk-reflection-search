Risk manager had to manage different strategies according to their knowledge and resources for proper risk management. I had to manage properly or in the best possible way, according to the information and had different tools, available resources (time, information, environment), then get the best benefit at the lowest cost.

I played the game several times, because I could not understand what he was looking for, but when i realized what i was looking for, perform different strategies have many pods first, then just a few more reinforced and finally very few pods protection. ometimes I will not have sufficient information with which I have to make decisions about how best to manage the risks; I also learned that uncertainty plays a major role and should be valued as much protection as alternative insurance. Maybe i would add a tool that could somehow calculate probabilities of frequency and severity in the fall of the meteor, that way the player could handle some variables that would enable it to take more assertive decisions.In the various risks that exist today, we know there are variables that are imponderables such as uncertainty in the case of natural disasters, we also know certain measurable variables such as epidemics and weather variables that are vulnerable to man-. All of them can give at the time, some opportunity to make the most of the circumstances and make risk management a success. I liked the game, it allowed me to realizing that through different scenarios I can have a better risk management and the information and knowledge you may have of the subject are preponderant to perform better manage potential risk and be able to generate and exploit the opportunities it generates .
