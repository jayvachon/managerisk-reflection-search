1. Risk management is the essential component of any development project. If risk management is not considered the benefits of development will be wipe out by a disaster and more resources would be required to respond and recover. For effective risk management, available resources had to be rationally used for acquiring knowledge, build protection for your investment and mitigate risk by insurance or risk transfer. Preparation for risk helps to ensure that your investment in development is secured and sustainable. 2. I played the game multiple times. After couple of times I realised that insuring the asset and time spend on research or acquiring knowledge in the initial stage helps to sustain the development. I started ensuring that I am informed about potential impact of any hazard and then took essential steps to secure by assets. This helped me to clear levels. 3. I propose to differentiate investment made in risk management to save lives and property. It will make it more interesting and challenging and also more relevant to real life. Also giving situation where the player has to make decision between short-term development gain against long term risk management benefits will make it more interesting.
