1, The risk management can mitigate the shock of being hit by comets. I did research(knowledge) the comets and lifted up the ground(protection) and insured by paying money. All of the ways of preparation doesn't have a good effect suddenly, but could affect after some time.2, If I played only once, I would also insure, but pay less money. Also, I would lift up the ground or do research less frequently because I wouldn't know how much the comets impact and how effective preparation is. When I played the game again, I speny more money preparing for being hit by the comets. What I learned from the game is two points. First, risk management takes money, but it is very important. When I spent more money for preparation,I can develop better  than when I don't spent. Also, at first, people doesn't know the impact of being hit by risk and the effect of risk management, so  I think people tend not to spend money on risk management.3.In the real world, we expect the probability that some bad thing such as flooding or earthquake happens subjectively. We expect the damage of the bad thing subjectively, too.  However, in the game, I can know the probability that comets hit the ground and the damage of being hit by comets objectively. Therefore, I would take that into consideration.
