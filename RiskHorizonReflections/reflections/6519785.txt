1.	The role of risk management in the game was to manage the exposure to risk of the civilization in the game in order for those risks not to hinder the development of civilization. Trade-offs had to be made, especially between knowledge and protection, one couldn’t do both at the same time so depending on the impeding risk and level of development one had to try and balance these aspects. As for preparation it affected development immediately in the sense that one wasted resources in preparation and retarded a bit development but it greatly paid off on later stages of development where when adverse situations occurred you didn’t suffer a great drawback in development because you were better prepared for the unfortunate events. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                        
2.	After the first time I paid more careful attention to the imminent risks and mitigation resources available than just growth and development. The main things I learned was that imminent risks are always present and you need to take them in account if you want to prosper without huge setbacks. A combination of Insurance, Protection (resilience) and Research (knowledge of surroundings, cyclical risks and risks in general) is therefore essential, and even so this cannot avoid negative events of occurring, so adding to this elements a swift and quick response when shocks occur linked to coordination of the different sectors of an economy can greatly minimize the impacts of negative shocks and make recovery more quick. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3.	The game captures and addresses some relevant aspects of risk management such as coordination in the community, uncertainty, myopia (if you don’t have a long-term perspective of planning and managing risk you most likely won’t succeed), the limited resources aspect that societies face, and tools to shield against risk, such as knowledge (research), protection and insurance. If I had to change on thing to better represent the risk management choices would be changing the assumption of only one risk. There are currently a multitude of risks present and some of equally high need of attention, given limited resources, sometimes they compete and you have to prioritize. Adding to this you have distributional effects, the area and population are wide and disperse, it is hard to protect all at once you have to start on some communities and build on. These are the aspects that I would try to also incorporate in the game.
