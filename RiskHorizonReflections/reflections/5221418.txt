The simulation game of world of Alora was no less than a real
time scenario where the community of Alora had to be saved from calamities by
using various precautionary measures or by taking corrective actions at the
right time.

                Development
of the community is done by making buildings or by continuous up gradation of
the pods made. Every pod fosters the development rate of the world of Alora.
This development is desired by all of the people in Alora for their happiness
and prosperity. Similarly numerous acts in our society is meant for the growth
and affluence in life. But these can never be fully focused as various ill
events may harm us if ignored which is shown as comet in the simulation game.

Alora community is facing catastrophes from falling comets
from space, which is a major concern in the path of development as not all the
funds can be allocated into development. Thus, there should be adequate savings
to save the community from such mishaps which have potential to make huge losses.
Safety precautions should be taken else these comets can hinder the development.
Though this made the community grow at a slower pace but safety was ensured at
every comet fall. 

                Game
had different abilities provided to us for saving community Research,
Protection, and Insurance, which were at the cost of rate of development. 

The power of research is to look into space for coming comet
which provides us many relevant information like the probability of hitting comet
into our world of Alora, severity of hit and an estimation of time by which it
will hit the ground. This can also be projected to various calamities happening
in real time in our regions. Considering the example of Bangladesh how they
invested money on forecasting hurricane and accordingly took right actions within
the stipulated time to avoid any bad consequences as much as they can. 

 The Power of Protection keeps the world of Alora safe from
waves which becomes dangerous whenever comet falls in the vicinity of land.
This protection ability will kept the land floated which kept the lives of the
Alora community safer. Similarly how Bangladesh took various steps like
evacuate places where hurricane was to hit can be taken as live example of this
power of the game which saved thousands of lives.

It is certain that such disasters can never leave the
community without loss. Here, loss can only be minimizing not eliminated. Power
of Insurance can be handy in such cases where it gives assurance of quicker and
cheaper rebuild and thus, faster recovery. Considering real time example of
Bangladesh hurricane disaster, insurance of any type say home insurance, health
insurance, Life insurance etc could be beneficial to the public in great
extend. 

This simulation game was quintessential to comprehend theoretical
part of risk and opportunity course by applying it into pragmatic arena. It
showcases how risk should always be taken care with the brainstorming about
possible coming consequences and various tools and techniques to avoid any such
hazardous consequences. It also made me understand the tradeoff between
different abilities provided to make a balance composition to strive for the
development of the community. As my balance went awry, small problems became
disastrous and may end the game resulting into devastation of the community. I
played this gamed for more than 3 times to comprehend how the balance maintained
in accord to the coming difficulty could be beneficial to foster the rate of
development of the region.
