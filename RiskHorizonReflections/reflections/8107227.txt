*The risk horizon game has many roles, one of the roles are to use all the resources you have to decrease the loss possibilities as much as you can while you facing the risk, some of those resources is: 1- Knowledge: by understanding the shock and how it will effect the thing and having your own view about the side effects ( positive and negative effects) also understand the internal and the external conditions and the potential outcome.2- Insurance: insurance is very important  it is one of the main parts of the risk management because it is transfer the resources across the people by sharing the risk so that the loss will be divided by many people which minimize the effect of the loss because some times the cost of the the loss is much bigger than than the people afford and it might effect country or the person badly for long time, so in this case the cost of the insurance is because necessary to take even it is very high and in the other hand we can measure the risk by the insurance if the risk is high the cost of the insurance is also high in most of the cases.3- Protection: it is about reducing to probability and the size of the cases and increase the benefits.4- Coping: it is about making the most of the benefits of the loss, for example there are many countries faced a big crisis but because the well management and forecasting of the future they change the loss to a great opportunity and they pass the crisis and they became one of the most important economy in the world.I believe when the country face a loss and it has a risk management plan it makes it stronger and able to to recover in the near future because the risk management is part of the brain storming process and it makes the plan more resilience and more creative.**When you play the game for the first time you couldn't understand how to make the balance between the three tools of risk management but from the second time you start to pay attention to the resources and the relation between them ( insurance, knowledge and protection ) and you make balance of three of them to reach the objective of the game successfully. It put in a real situation and you have to make a plan to protect what you have by using the resources and the balance of them.***In the place I related to ( Egypt ), I think the brain storming is one of the tools which will adding a good value to the four risk management tools if it is came after the knowledge ( research) because I believe that we can find an idea which can make a big difference to change the way of the loss in other hand it can minimize the loss by finding a way to face the risk.Again in the place where am living (Egypt) people always facing many types of risks in daily basis such as leaving the job so that you find them naturally thinking in many ways to increase the income from other legal resources, they knows well there are a risk all the time and they thinking how to reduce the risk specially people whom having their own business (SME).Singapore is one of the countries create a brilliant idea to face the rain by the underground tunnels which use for the cars and in the rain's season it works as rain tunnels.
