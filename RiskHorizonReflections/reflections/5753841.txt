The role of risk management in
the risk horizon game was to ensure that the risks associated with the damages
were managed appropriately. Most activities involved providing adequate
insurance and implementing techniques and strategies to control the damages and
losses so that the structures remained safe. Also, it was necessary to gain
knowledge about areas susceptible disaster. 

Funds were required to achieve
goals because nothing could be achieved without money. Insurance, repair to
losses and knowledge required money to utilise these. A major choice I made was
to transfer the risk by purchasing insurance early enough. Â Also, I utilised the money soon as they become
available.

Choices made include purchasing
insurance very early in the game to cater for any form of disaster that may
occur so that I would not end up paying for all the damage. This is a form of
risk transfer strategy. I also tried to carry out extensive research as much as
possible to provide more knowledge about proposed disaster. 

Even while disaster occurred,
development activities still took place. At no time were funds lying idle. Due to
availability of milestones in the game, I also worked around the clock to
ensure that the damage was rectified as soon as possible. Insurance is also an important aspect of risk management

The changes i would propose in the game are to increase the time frame and also make provisions to access funds for development. I would also ensure that risk management is several people's responsibility.
