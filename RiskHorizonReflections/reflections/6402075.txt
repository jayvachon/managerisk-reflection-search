The role of the risk management in the game was crucial - without putting enough interest in it - investing a lot into development, but not watching for risks, I always failed quickly. The same happened if I put too much pressure on preparing and preventing the risks - least improvement was achieved when taking care too much of only single thing. If I weight equally getting knowledge, buying insurance and improving protection with development I achieved the best results. Good and wighted preparation for risk gave results after the longer time, lack of preparation caused a fail quite immidiatelly.
About changing one thing in the game to make it more applicable to place where I live - the number of possible risks should be increased - not only meteors, but for example also some other unrelated floodings, maybe some volcano, and lack of resources other than money.
