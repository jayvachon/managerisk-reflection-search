1. What was the role of risk management in the game?
The role of risk management towards development of society was clearly shown in the game. The game shows that TIME is an important factor in developmental process, the judicious use of time helps one to prepare adequately for risk which in turn helps development process.
The major role of risk management in the game was for one to know how to balance between developing our community and preparing for potential shocks that may arise through the development activities or naturally. In balancing this, the game points out three(3) core tools in risk management. First is the power of research,from the lesson learnt in the game, research is also part of developmental process. With adequate research one can evaluate the adverse of an incoming risk,the severity of the risk on the developmental process, and the impact of the risk on the people.When adequate research is carried out, it affords one the opportunity to create community connection even when hit by the potential shock.secondly, getting insurance from private and other organisation helps to reduce the cost of adverse potential shock on the community and hence getting insurance is an efficient and effective role of risk management.

2.What i did differently the other time of playing the game was investing more time into research which affords me to create community connection when hit by severe shock.
The main things I learnt from the game is that TIME is an important factor in development face and investing the time wisely helps one to build a better society.And that every thing done requires finance.

3.The change i will propose are:
a. Give different development option which will have different cost implication and different income stream base on cost benefit.
b. include different potential shock like vices in the community, terrorism, flooding etc.
c. opportunity to seek expertise outside ones community since the world is a global village.
