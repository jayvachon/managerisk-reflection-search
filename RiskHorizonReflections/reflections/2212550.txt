1) We had to make the trade off between spending resources in defense, building construction and insurance and investing our time between those activities or research on the comets.I started building first and buying insurance and defense as soon as I saw the comets arriving (so leaving some cash on the side for there). Also, when I was low in cash, I would do research while the pods were being built. Preparing ahead is definitely important, and buying insurance made it a lot easier managing risk. 2) I played the game twice and the difference is that the second time I started purchasing some insurance, usually I tried to go for the highest, if I had enough money, which was the case. The main things that I learnt:-buy insurance-invest as much as you can, but leave a bit of cash aside for rainy days; when you don't have anything urgent to do, do a lot of research, that really makes the difference.3) In the game every area was hit in the same way, while what happens in real life is that some are hit less badly and some areas are worse. I think would be interesting adding a feature able to differentiate the areas and once research is done, to have the game signal you which ones are the most dangerous areas to avoid constructing them.Moreover we could introduce some buildings more resistant than others (so we can put them in riskier areas) and have them to become more safe the more research we do.
