The poposed game was very interesting, the event indicated as the fall of a meteorite has allowed me to actually simulate an event classified based on the impact and the probabiliy, assessing the risk arising. Based on thisÂ  classification to decide what kind of strategy use to mitigate the risk, transfer, accept it. Howover is only an online game, the game features can be traslated in a real environment, but where the real difficulty lies in defining correctly the severity and probability of the event. This makes the risk analysis and aquantitative cartainly useful, but it makes the quality of the analysis subject to the assessment and the experience of the analyst, parameter too often overlooked, and little regarded. This type of games really help to understand the actions to be taken, but highlight the importance of a proper preliminary analysis.
