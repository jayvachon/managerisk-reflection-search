Risk management  involved investing in building more pods,
     also investing in protection, research and insurance.  Protection and insurance helped to
     cushion the impact of the comets when they hit. Even the recovery from the
     shock was easier and less costly.I played the game more
     than five times. I tried various options. What seemed to work for me even
     to reach my highest level attained. (Level 2) was investing in more pods,
     getting maximum insurance and also raising the protection and research.
     After the shock, I quickly rebuilt and continued with the protectionI found the game a bit
     difficult to play. For instance I could not raise protection to my desired
     level.  The instructions or tutorial
     for the game could be made more user friendly. Otherwise the Game represented  very well the risk management choices
