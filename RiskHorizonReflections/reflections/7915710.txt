The
objective of the game was to make the right decision between different
combinations of knowledge, protection and insurance as the city was growing,
but also was important to take in count how quickly did you want the city to
grow and what is the equal growth of each one of the houses. In the beginning
of the game could be observe that the first step to follow was to have a base
of the city, which allowed the player to get money that would be subsequently
invested in decisions that involve risk management, subsequently the priority
was to protect the city because a meteorite will approach soon, at the moment
that meteorite is coming was obligatory to investigate it and the player must
decide if he/she wanted to investigate more , or stop the research depending on
two things specifically: the probability of collision and the severity of the collision,
if the two factors were very high the player had to keep investigating in order
to take corrective actions, either more protection, buy some kind of insurance
or just continue the growth of the city. 
The preparation for risk only affects development after some time,
because the benefits only come after a collision and becomes more easy growth
if there was a preparation for the risk.

The growth of
the city should be continuous, since investment as the city grows must be higher,
when the city has more population and more assets the insurance plays a much
more important role because the risk is not idiosyncratic as before and becomes
a systematic risk. Another important fact highlight was that while minor is the
protection, the damage is going to be bigger, therefore it would be more
lasting the recovery.

The first time
I played the game, I tried to use the more recourses I had without thinking
what their function was and when they were useful, then I began to invest in
insurance without even having knowledge of the damage that would be next and
also the protection was minimal as it was feared that investing in it woul slow
the growth. As I played more times, I started to think that I should apply what
a learned in the week, so , so I must give priority to knowledge to proceed
with other items making an assessment of the internal and external system and  the conditions.

If i could
add one thing, I would add a feature that has to do with the behavior of
people, because often there are good intentions of the government but the
people are the ones who ruin the risk management.
