1. The role of risk management in the game are to identify, to assess and prioritize the damage that the meteor can cause; therefore, to prevent or to reduce the destruction that can be make. At first, I focused a lot on insurance, but then I realize that it's just a temporary solution; because it only reduce the cost of the restructuring and it only effect after the disaster, that means you can not stop the cause by this way and you waste your time on the restructuring. So I switched to other things (research and protection) and figure out some points:- Research:+ Advantages: You can predict the damage and the chance of the meteors; you can buy some time for your citizens to prepare the floods.+ Disadvantages: You can not develop in the same time, that means the profits will not maximize.- Protection:+ Advantages: This is the most powerful tool to prevent the disaster.+ Disadvantages: The same as the power of research and it costs money; the more money you spend on it the more you will be safe.2. I played it a lot. Basically, I have  mastered the game in some point. The first thing I learned that "Never focus on one tool to protect yourself" - by this, I switch from invest all my assets in insurance to  research and protection.The second thing is "Balance is the key" - Your resources are limited and you have a goal to archive, don't invest to much or to little. The last thing is "Luck is an important element" - even when you balance very well and you control everything in your hands; It's not always go as you please, sometimes it's impossible to pass; As in the reality, you are not always control "Mother Nature".3. The game is perfect balance by itself, you only can add some factors to improve the game-play: Add the multiplayer function, let you and your friend cooperate is an example.
