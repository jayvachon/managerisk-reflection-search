Risk management is the process of confronting risks,preparing for them and copying with there effects.There are 2 goals of risk managementto build resilience/positive change,ability to mitigate losses for adverse shock and for faster recoveryto build prosperity  The risk management process include :Identify potential exposure to loss Measure frequency and severity Examine alternative Decide which alternative to use Implement the chosen techniqueMonitor results Risk management has played very important role in regard to this game all the risk management process mention above  will used in this game first identify potential exposure to loss like in game there are comets you have to identify them secondly measure the frequency and severity and examine the alternative i.e take insurance or increase your protection and then decide which alternative to use then implement the same and monitor the result. When i played the game i choose to spent time on research in initial stage afterward  i considered to take insurance because if you spent more time on research on comets it will give you less time to develop your community.If you are prepare for the risk it will help you in future in terms of rebuilt your houses at very nominal price and you can develop alora without any fear of loss.I just played this game 2 times, in second attempt i just got experience how to manage risk and how to use the opportunity in 2 attempt i realised  how to spend money and how to maintain balance between spending money on insurance and spending time on research,in 2 attempt initially i built few houses and starting research on comets which help me to get on next level but later on i spent money on taking insurance because if u are spending your time on so much on research you got less time to develop your community and insurance also helps you to rebuilt your houses at very nominal prices ,also focus on a security of a pound because it will save my money by not getting higher amount of insurance but 1 thing also kept in my mind that if i spent more time on security it will directly affect on your development because it will give you less time to develop your pond.There are many things that i learned from this game i.erisk management is a powerful tool for development for example in this game if you are taking risk on investing huge amount on insurance it will give you benefits in future if coments hits you can rebuild your houses at very nominal amount and it will not effect on your developmentknowledge is another tool that will help you for example in this game if you are research on comets than you know about you can save your community by increasing security or by taking some insurance it saves lifegive food securityhelps in financial crises IF i will got the chance to developed the new version of the game i would like to add feature name called" climate change" in this feature alora villagers  also doing harvesting so there is chance of drought you can take knowledge about that and government  of alora also provide index contract to save the community from draught and there is a another option to built flood and earthquake resistant houses.
