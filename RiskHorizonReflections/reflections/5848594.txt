In the game risk-management played the crucial role. it was necessary to combat risks represented by comets and deal with the consequences resulted from comet clashes. When I played the game I preferred to build more pods and provide insurance. Generally I had to make choices between making researches and spending time, buying insurance and spending money, investing in readiness to risk and losing both time and money. It was really difficult to find balance between these items. Preparation to risk for risk affected development badly at the first stages, but in the end it was really useful.Â At first I did not invest money in research but when I did it really helped me several times. I also invested more money and time in readiness to risk. In the end, I found out that it better to focus on risk prevention. Buying insurance was useful as well, however it still requires a lot of resources.I would change the time when building links between pods is required. It is too late, to my mind, to do it after a comet clashes the planet. It should be done in advance. Also it would add some more difficulty to the game since the new variable is introduced. This would enrich the number of choices we should make.
