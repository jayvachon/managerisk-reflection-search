The Risk Horizon game is a simple example showing the trade-offs between growth and protection.  Investing in greater protection could guarantee that no great harm would come to the population, but this would come at the expense of societal growth.  Therefore there is a trade-off to be made, to improve the lives of citizens investment in protection will not always be maximised.  The role of insurance can help smooth these decisions.  While some protection is needed to ensure that small level damage does not continually hold back society, investing in large scale protection can sometimes be too expensive, and thus insurance can make lighten the load.  However, when adding greater knowledge through research the decision to protect or insure becomes easier.  When you have perfect knowledge of what will happen in future there is no need to take out insurance, unless you will be unable to protect yourself.  This means in this game insurance should only be taken out when it is clear that a real threat exists that you cannot protect yourself against.  The advantage of using protection over insurance is that protection not only helps in the short term, but continues to exist in the medium term, therefore the investment made continues to reap dividends as the game progresses.

The more I played the game the less insurance I used and the more research I did.  Once you knew what was going to happen you could make accurate investment decisions in protection, and only seek insurance for extreme events.  Thus the more you play the game the more you realise that information is key to making decisions and the risk is taken out of them.  Insurance is only needed when you don't know what will happen, or you can't prevent it.

The game allows you to obtain too much information too easily, this element of the game can be reduced to make decisions harder and thus more realistic.  Also, while having so few elements makes for simplicity adding in other events, and investment decisions can again complicate he game and thus again make it more realistic.

The game did remind me of the floods that recently occurred in the South West of England.  There are flood defences there, but they are not designed for extreme events.  So when more rain fell than the defences could cope with the area flooded.  The government has clearly made a decision not to invest in greater protection and allow for insurance to pay for extreme events.  But the damage from these events, doesn't just cost money it sets growth backwards as investment is required to get back to normal.  Therefore protection is always superior to insurance.
