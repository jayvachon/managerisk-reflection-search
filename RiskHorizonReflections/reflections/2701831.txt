In this game, the role of risk management
is to balance the protection, insurance, development, and observation. 

 

Well, I feel that Insurance is much more
important than what I initially thought. It could cover the majority of the
cost which occurred by damages.

 

I didn’t realized the power of Protection
is the fir time, so I trade-off a bit of development for protecting when I
played it in later tries.

 

What I learnt from this game is that the
balance of policy combination is very hard, but it’s also very important to
policymakers.

 

If I could re-design this game, I would
probably consider giving the player more time for thinking, rather than rushing
with the timing.
