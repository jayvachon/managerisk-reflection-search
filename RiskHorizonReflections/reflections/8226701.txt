The Risk Horizon
game managed to interactively exemplify to the class the importance that risk
management plays in our lives for the sustainability and benefit of our
communities. This rather-simple game allowed us to be the direct decision
makers for a short while; choosing which strategy to use for the safekeeping of
our communities and deciding when risks could be manageable and when imminent
was key to success in the game.

Risk management played
a key component on this game. Having the direct and known threat of comets hitting
the communities under care, the player was well-aware of having to make the
decisions directly related to preparing for the risk, confronting it, and later
coping with its effects. For me particularly, a very important component for
success in the game was protection and insurance. For this reason, I decided to
do as much research as possible on all comets, focusing particularly in the
ones with the highest damage level. This research allowed me to then protect
and upgrade my communities accordingly.

Equally, I
remained committed to the most comprehensive insurance policy throughout the
levels; realizing that threat was imminent and that damage was going to occur
to a certain degree despite my best efforts, I believed that the insurance
policy helped me cope with those damages more effectively. While developing my
community throughout the relevant levels, the most challenging part for me was
being able to upgrade comprehensively throughout the territory while at the
same time dealing effectively with the negative impacts of a particular hit. It
was clear throughout this process that every action and decision we make has a
related cost, whether this cost is reflected in time or in resources. 

Though the game
was overall helpful and representative of how risk management could be managed
(or mismanaged) by a decision-maker, if I could change or improve one thing it
would be the way that the particular communities communicated with each other. In
the game it seemed to be only useful to connect with the communities after a
hit had taken place, rather than before any imminent risk occurred which could
have allowed the player to make a better informed decision and to better
understand whether the communities where properly position and equipped for the
imminent damage.

This is in fact
something I believe could also be improved in my current place of residence,
Qatar. In Doha, though to a different scale, there is clear miscommunication
between the various entities in place for risk management and control. Although
the country’s size and relatively small population should work to the advantage
of proper risk management, there continue to be small-scale examples of the
failing relationship between the fire department, construction-related public
safety institutions, and the relevant Ministry involved for example.

Throughout the
game, I learned the importance of being quick yet insightful when dealing with
risk management. The more a community engages in activities the more prone and
susceptible it could become to risk. Accordingly, responding to risk with the
appropriate knowledge and insurance, and having had necessary protection
beforehand is fundamental. The game illustrated the importance of finding an advantageous
balance between these factors, a balance that will allow for a community to
prosper beyond the damages of the risk at hand.
