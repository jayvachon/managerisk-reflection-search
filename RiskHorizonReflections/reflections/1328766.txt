In the risk management game my role was very important. I needed to measure the risk of the meteors. I know the chance of hit, the severity and the protection. I needed to summarize them, and I must made a decision.In the future game, I will make more protection, to keep off the critical damages. I learned that the protection and the alertness is very important.In my opinion this game is very good. The Rick Horizon reflects the aspects of risk management very well. In the future versions I should prove the prevention of the hits, like I hit the meteors. It would be the special option, what require som research. Of course, my hits to the meteors should have the "chains of hits" too.
