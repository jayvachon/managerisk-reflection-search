The game process of the Risk Horizon is fully interwined with risk management. To succed in this game player has to choose his own strategy of development (how many buildings should be built, how to upgrade them), which type of insurance to buy and how much you need to increase your protection, and how much you will gain knowledge about asteroids (or comets). I played several times and during the games I tryed to build up all possible buildings, and because I lost a lot of time to repair them all, next times I choose to build less and upgrade them, and bought 70% insurance to save time for exploring comets. Main thing I learned is that time management is also one of the most key factors on risk management, because I hadn't enough time to repair, to explore and to develop.As for me new version should be more prolonged and make more funny. In place where I live may be earthquackes, so it would be better to increase protection buildings when player upgrades them.
