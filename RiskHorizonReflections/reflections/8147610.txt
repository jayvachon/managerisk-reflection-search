To avoid risk, you have to know the risk protect themselves against the risk accordingly by building good defenses strengthen defenses as and as the risk is severe make sure to be able to deal with the damage at lower cost well appreciate the cost benefit concept it is important to protect but not at any cost, not if it means losses when risk is fully hedged well master the cost compared to what is gained by ensuring against the risk I played twice and the first time I did not take into account the cost benefit concept which had to cost a lot of consequence to the community. Indeed incomes in developing countries are so weak to do the right thing and be effective and efficient it is to say to the expense it takes to lower costs
