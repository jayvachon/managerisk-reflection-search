Meanly, the game is interesting because is shows the importance of knowledge, protection and insurance in risk management. I remarked that the most those elements are considered, the less the risks are. Even if it is a game, it is not easy to find the right balance and this show that in real life situation, thing must be more complicated. My first choice is knowledge because I deem that it is important to know the situation, be informed on the risks before taking action. protection and insurance are at the same level and are necessary to save or rebuild things, depending on the cas. What is sure, if preparation for risk is well implemented, people have facility to dare and to take actions, to innovate in order to improve their live.The fist time I have played the game, I did'nt inderstand anything but as I continue playing, it was at the same time instructive, useful and funny and progressively, I catch it up. But it still remains a bit unclear for me because when I reached the second level, I didn't know why I lost though my community didn't suffer any damage.I thing that the game is at the same time simple and complicated. The conception of the game is quite simple but playing is a bit challenging. If I have to change in the game, I will make knowledge automatic and as soon as a meteor appear , the screen presente informations on it. This will be more simple to deal with.Personaly, I've learned thing that help me to be more prepared to take on risks.
