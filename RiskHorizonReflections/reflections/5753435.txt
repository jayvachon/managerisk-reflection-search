REFLECTION ON RISK
HORIZON GAME

The game shows that risk
management is not just a policy package, but an ability to learn about and
react quickly and timely to an impending disaster. The game itself is a case
example of just how important system dynamics is in risk management. Rather than
formulating a policy package on dealing or reacting with disasters, this game
offers a new thinking in terms of integrating the three principal pillars in
risk management – Research, Insurance, and Protection. 

The choices made reflected the
urgency, scale, and magnitude of an impending disaster. Faced with limited
financial resources and lack of adequate knowledge of the size of an impending
calamity, the choices were sometimes made to save some communities which showed
early signs of resilience and self-adaptability. Sometimes protection from the
impending disaster was made on meager financial resources to obtain at least a
second level insurance. Overall, the development of the community was slowed
down due to increasing cost in time allocated for research and cost of building
the protection levels.

While playing this game, the
first time was very difficult, but after having “mastered’ a bit of this
dynamic process through trial-and error methodology, I then learned how to strengthen
the risk management plan by involving more of community resilience strategy
(Community-to-Community support) and more investment in research. In the middle
of this mainframe strategy was the decision to obtain optimal insurance and
build up on the defenses against the impending disaster. The main things that I
learned from the game are as follows: Research in risk assessment and disaster preparedness
pays off. Financial insurance is an integral part of any risk assessment and
disaster preparedness program and that this should be at the center of the any
community or national budgeting process.

If I were to be given a choice of
improving this game, I would focus on the issues that matter most to us as small
island communities – the declining quality of our fresh water aquifers and how
this risk sits at the center of our community health, environment, education,
and sustainable development issues. The physical growth of the society has
increased an extensive amount of pressure on the carrying capacity of our fresh
water aquifers to cope with the rising demand and provision of sweet potable
water as opposed to saline and contaminated water. As an agrarian society that
relies heavily on nature rather than on modern technology to support its agricultural
and cropping systems, the risk of declining fresh water aquifers brings in a
unique dooms day scenario for the islands which have no perennial fresh water
resources such as rivers or lakes, and whose hydrological cycle completely
depends on the carrying capacity of the fragile coralline aquifers surrounded
by the encroaching ocean.
