Alora Challenge

Risks are the phenomena of probabilistic shocks and their
consequences. Consequences are gains or losses: shifts in equilibrium or
normality. Managing these risks requires hedging the probabilities, practical
preparation in order to avoid the preventable and cope with the inevitable. 

The Alora challenge required the ability to create a livable
normality while efficiently hedging and preparing for probabilistic shocks
(comets and waves). The shocks were complimented by the balancing between
insurance cost (hedging), protection cost (practical preparation) research cost
(institutional readiness) and development (establishing normalcy).

There are six levels to the challenge. I completed 4 levels,
failing to complete the fifth (I played several times changes my risk approach
each time). My success came in preemptively protecting my development then researching
the first few comets. I never built pods until after the first two storms, then
I built three at a time- this improved my development meter. My trade off to
fast development was cost aversion through slow sustainable development.

Medium coverage insurance was my cost choice because I spent
a lot on research and maintaining external protection nets (well off
communities). Networks were effective after shocks (a comet hitting) and this
preserved insurance payouts and proved the medium insurance an efficient
purchase. 

Networks or community resources is another type of insurance
and protection. Well-developed built environments and resourceful residents
help lower insurance cost and make protective mechanisms and maneuvers (i.e., evacuation)
efficient and lower in cost (cost sharing occurs). In order to create strong
networks I upgrade the pods in threes. New developments were constructed at the
same time as research. Upgrades occurred after the passing of the most- known-
aggressive shocks. 

I ignored less sever comets regardless of probabilistic
assessment, my focus in most of my plays was on intense comets (the research
time spent was altered each challenge by ten seconds).

I learned that my willingness to assess risk and develop simultaneously
was time saving and successful. My unwillingness to develop fast and upgrade
often may have taken me out of the game in the fifth level. I had to use
insurance more often when I changed my strategy on research (researching more
only for more intense risk). Protecting for all possible risk and researching
more often saved insurance cost. 

If I had an opportunity to update the Alora challenge I
would add two other shocks by the end of the challenge (level 6). Focal shocks
(one property being damaged) would show how well networks work in minimal
crisis. In reality people measure their participation on their perception of
side effects. Many Americans send money to Haiti after earth quakes; although,
the U.S. government and insurance companies help American cities the most after
domestic quakes. Â 

Lastly, I would add scenarios that force players to
contemplate increasing insurance coverage during high probabilistic phases. I
noticed players could not decrease insurance coverage after increasing it, this
affects the ability to assess true player cost benefit prioritization.
