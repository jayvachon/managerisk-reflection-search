Risk Horizon game reflection  1) The role of risk Management in the game is to try to make a balance of all the attributes the community has to defend it against the menaces, in this case the comets. Like in the real life happens , we can not just take a decision that after could affect the development of a comunnity without the proper information before the decision is taken. In terms of Knowledge, I faced trade offs like having more info instead protecting more the comunity. In protection, was difficult to decide at what level average the community could be well protected without risking time for having more info. At level of insurance, it was difficult to decide what level of insurance we should take because we are spending money to build or upgrade what we already create. Preparation for risk affected the community development in matter of the money available to their needs, in this case upgrading. There were some times that was no possible to upgrade, instead was necesary to protect, that was after some time. On the other hand when two or three comets were present was possible just to have more info and protect a little bit better.2) I played the game 4 times, arriving level 4 but without succeed. What I made different every time after, was that I was taking a look to have more information about the comets so that I could construct more conecctions in the community, and also to know if the treath was really valuable to have in account or not. So in that way I decided for example to protect the community till the level that the comet could cause the damage but regarding always that if the chances to hit were more than 50%, so I could protect the constructions. Also. after the first time I decided not to buy the expensive insurance, always I was for the middle one, so that I could have money for constructing and upgrading. On the other hand I always was regarding the limit of time to achieve my goal, and construct as much as possible and update as much as possible. when more than 2 comets arrived I just decide to protect to the high level possible and having time for research to construct the time for the conections. That at the end was the best solution, and I learned that from the game. I learned that with the proper info and correct interpretation from the info we could take the best solutions according our objectives and ressources possibilities.3)I´d change in more things that could affect the community like, health problems related with the impact in long term. So, it would be necessary to introduce the population element, with some biotic or abiotic factors that could affect their development. In the place I live for example there is a lot of floods, every year affecting the agriculture therefore affecing the food provision. Also, this treath is not always for survival agriculture also for agribussiness that at the end affects the entire economy. So, at top level of the game we could include the macroeconomic components, and with that we could obtain a balance in a determinated period of time. In summary, the game was a good experience but could result repetitive in the risk management, so the suggestion will be towards the variability of the risks to face.
