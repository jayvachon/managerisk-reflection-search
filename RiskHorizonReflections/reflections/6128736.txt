Role of risk management was to save the community from comets and ensure their resilience.When it comes to knowledge research did help but not always,for  protection up gradation and building community bridge played significant role.Insurance was the factor to cope up at the last stage when destruction seemed to irreversible.Preparation of risk hindered the increased in construction of more cupids which later on led to decrease in money earned.       When asked to play game again i would like to analyze balance to be kept between the three factors knowledge, insurance and protection.This experience of repetition gives us time to explore and innovate new ideas with regard to the situation to build our community.Beside providing overview of application of the concept the game made us to think in a realistic way bringing in new perspective to prepare for the risk.Alteration which i would recommend is to delay the affect of comet destruction and prediction in reality are more accurate though in game the protect against were not working.So more time limit should be extended to have better understanding of risk and opportunities involved in it.
