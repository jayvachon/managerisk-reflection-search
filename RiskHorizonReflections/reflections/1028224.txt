The game was all about Risk Management, how you need to think strategically - balancing between preparing for risk and investing in developing your community- and also thinking about the different tools you have at your disposal. For example, when I first played I put too much emphasis on insurance, and could not easily progress past level 1! Then I realized it is not enough to rely on insurance after the fact, you also need to invest heavily in development and protection. Preparation for risk is very important I learned in the later attempts of game. The mistake I was doing was I was protecting my community enough for the severity of the comet strike. Then later as trade-offs I spent slightly more on protection and development than information and insurance. My biggest learning was that unless you have protection measures at place yourself, insurance can not help you. The balance between risk preparation and developing your community is (intentionally) difficult to reach. If you spend too much on building and upgrading pods, you will be exposed to comets when they hit. When you sustain damage from comets your progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if you spend too much on preparation for risk, you will not have enough money to develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.This is a balance policy makers have to consider all the time. They have limited resources, so there is a tension between spending up front on risk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but may not hit) or to spend on other development priorities. How should they spend their money is an important decision.One change for my community would be I would be carrying out Research and Raising the level of protection simultaneously as soon as the research level indicates an increasing level of severity.
