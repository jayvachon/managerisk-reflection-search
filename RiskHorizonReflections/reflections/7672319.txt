The
role of risk management in this game was to explore the right opportunities in
order to achieve prosperity by investing in building and upgrading plants,
whilst preparing for and coping with the comet hits. I found that it was a very
good way to help me understand the necessary actions that need to be taken when
dealing with risks, perhaps even more so than reading an article or doing a quiz. I learned for example how to use the money wisely in order
to confront the risks in a beneficial manner through buying insurance, even
though not always the most expensive one, and investing in research as opposed
to spending it all on developing plants. Moreover, I realized that gaining more
knowledge helps in the aftermath of the shock with building community support
and resilience.   

The
most important thing that I have learned from this game is that coping with the
result of a shock is lot more difficult if there is no prior investment in
research and preparation. Repairing the damages costs money and more
importantly valuable time that could have otherwise been used for obtaining
more knowledge, protection and insurance. Every time I was done repairing, I
was left with very little time to do anything else before another comet hit.
Having learned that research is a very good way of preparing for disaster, I played
the game again and did much better. I also noticed that the impact of bad
resource management had a long-term effect and that even when I was following
all the necessary steps to get back on track it was difficult to get the
results bar back to green after it went down to red for a long time.

With
regards to possible updates to the game I would perhaps add an external element
that could offer additional support, for example a government agency or an NGO.
I believe the presence of such an actor would make the game more realistic as
to what there is available to people experiencing crises of different kinds in
the real world. The game could feature an option like “Apply for Funding/Gain
New Skills” in order to better prepare for the hit or learn better ways to cope
with its aftermath.
