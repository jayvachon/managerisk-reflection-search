The role of the Risk Management was to identify the problem, protect  and also look for opportunities to grow...I tried to balance the three in order to make my choice..the knowledge was the initial part and i needed the knowledge to understand the level of protection i need to choose..I tried to insure my pods to decrease the level of monetary losses incase of any damage done..Being prepared for the risk i was in a better position to develop.After the initial game I tried to figure out how best I can balance protection and development.While  development is important you also need to be prepared for the adversitiesI would like to add some obstacles which come in your way like for example maybe obstacles from the community people.....
