 The  role of risk management in the game was  not only prevention of risk  and 
also the effective handling of spreading the risk by  utilizing the research and evaluate the risk to
be ensue and  use the insurance to
minimize the losses.  

Based on the effect of the comet I took the choices and gave
priority to build and make connections to community and increase the height of
the island and always keep resources to buy insurance whenever the research and
effectiveness of risk is high.

In long run, preparation for risk affect the development not in a
big way, but it affect the development in minimal level by means of diversion
of resources, time taken to preventive measure and cost of insurance to cover
the risk. The immediate effect of preparation for risk affect the development
drastically by slows down the growth.

I have played this game more than once, first time i never used the
preventive measure such as increase the height of the island and used the
insurance only. Next time i used the research, information and evaluate the
probable risk to be faced by the community and applied the insurance. It has
been learned from this game that insurance alone could not minimise the risk,
the effective handling of risk by taking appropriate preventive measures and
insurance.

I would like to propose to incorporate the preventive as well as
insurance for the losses of human lives and health which would happen during
disasters.
