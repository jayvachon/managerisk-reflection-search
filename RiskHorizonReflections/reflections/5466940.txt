Risk management which is based on
three key components: Preparation (knowledge), protection and insurance,
represents a good combination to face risks hitting communities.

My task was to boost the ability
of the world of Alora to resist to the waves evolved by the falling of comets.

In fact, in the beginning of the
game, I had to grasp how to balance between my tools and how to use them
properly in order to diminish the gravity of the damage which varies from one
comet to another.

One important thing that I used
throughout the game was to get acknowledged of the comet by clicking on it so
as to assess how severe it is form my community and to adapt the level of
protection to it.

I had to deal with a number of
trade-offs related to the respect of the horizon, the guarantee of a good level
of protection, the cost and the repair of the damage.

If I had played the game only
once, I would research more about the comets the next time, pay more attention
to the horizon and act quickly to reach the level of the line at the left. In
fact, the game has taught me that a good knowledge accompanied with a good preparation
is the basic tools to alleviate or get rid of the damage caused by risks. 

My proposition concerning the
game is to focus on a single level and to work on a real case. To be more
explicit, we can study a real risk that had occurred in developing country for
example, since they are the most vulnerable, and to let the student suggest
what he would have do if he has been a decision maker and compare his decisions
in the end with the measures that were taken in reality.
