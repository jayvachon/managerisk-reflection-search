The role of risk management was to offer the villagers some sort of protection against the shock and as result make them cope with the outcomes of the shock. The choices I made was to make investments that were protected by research and insurance. The trade offs were to minimize on new investment as we repaired the shattered ones based on the knowledge gained from observing the meteors, insure more during safe season and protect more during the shocks. Preparation for risk affected the time require for more investment within the island.
The main things I learnt from the game after playing more than three times were the risk, opportunity and protection were all occurring almost at the same time, it therefore meant learning process needed to be carried out very fast to come up with protection measure that would reduce the effects of the shock and help the villagers cope much better after every shock occurred.
I would definitely add a concept where people are able to move from the original home to other places where the shocks were not as rampant or the living conditions were easily managed as compared to that particular village. I would also make sure that all the learning and protection mechanism are better displayed for quick and accessible options for the player.
