The role of the risk manager in the game was to build a sustainable community at the same time as raising their resiliency through the elevation of the community above sea level and building their financial  resources worth, in order to protect the community from the comate impact. As a risk manager I had to assure that I was covering all aspect of the community risk management measures as well as the community financial and resources growth, and buying the proper insurance, at the same time as managing the financial and material resources.
 The proper build up of the community resources and network made it easier to survive, with less damage when disaster strike, by  building the community network we were making sure that everyone could be covered and accelerating mutual aid inside the present community .  

The main thing I learned from the game, it’s the fact that in order to manage risk properly we need to take in consideration all aspects of the community as well as monitoring risk in so doing we can make sure that we cover all aspects of the risk management measures.

If I had the possibility to develop a new version of the game, I would make more realistic by putting all the different components and variables that compose of my city full pictures. Including the geographic areas, major infrastructures, the different types of hazards and also the opportunities the can be pull out of such situation. I would create it in a way that we can play with all the variations and create our own scenarios, in so doing we could face different outcomes and learn from our mistakes.

In order for a game to capture everything that can enter to consideration while planning for managing risk, we need to consider  the geographic areas, the major infrastructures’, its major financial developments (opportunities and weakness), Its vulnerability (population density, ages, ethnic groups, etc..,  what types of materials are the infrastructure  built and how old they are), we need to identify the types and levels of hazards  (present and future not yet identified but none the less potential threats to our community locally and internationally) and create multiple scenarios that will cover every points mentioned and more
