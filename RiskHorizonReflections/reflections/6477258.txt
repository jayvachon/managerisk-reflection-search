I think that risk management played an important role in the game as it mitigated the damage of any unforeseen crises. Personally, I felt that the trade-offs were protection vs insurance (how much to protect vs whether one should buy the most insurance), protection vs upgrading (the cost of protection vs the cost of upgrading), upgrading vs insurance (the cost of upgrading vs the cost of insurance), as well as imperfect information in the game (i.e. whether to protect/upgrade more when there's an impending meteor strike). In my opinion, preparation for risk affected development immediately - for instance, short term costs included the opportunity cost of upgrading/buying new pods. However, in the long term, the insurance/protection paid off in the end.

I played the game more than once - I scored rather badly the first time due to spending "too much" on insurance despite copious investments on protection, which then resulted in a lack of development of pods. After losing the game, I changed my strategy by balancing the need to develop and the need to insure. For instance, I tended to focus on protection rather than insurance per se (e.g. I would invest around 33% or 50% on insurance instead of 75% - this helped save money and besides, the amount of protection mitigated the insurance).

I would add (economic) risk management to the game. Living in Singapore, we do not have much natural resources or natural disasters (as depicted by the game). Rather, as Singapore is a major trading hub in Asia, financial or economic risk management should be included. Moreover, I feel that diversification of assets can be included in the game (i.e. other than pods, perhaps there could be other forms of "development" with different "resilient indexes" to meteor strikes).
