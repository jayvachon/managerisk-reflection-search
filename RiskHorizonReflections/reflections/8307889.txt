The role of risk management in the game was very
huge. There were many obstacles in achieving the goal at each level. Comets
were the destructing element in the game. Escaping from such destruction was an
important task in the game. Basically, the game aimed in protecting the pods,
which are the households. Risk management helps in protecting the pods from
being destructed by comets. At the same time it is necessary to make sure that
the currency also does not come down and ensure that the meter is in green
color. Firstly, in the first level, i created 4 pods. As the pods were created, i started upgrading each pod. So as to develop the area. And also i made sure that protection is given to the pods. Protection given to the pods depends on the severity and chances of hits. If the severity and chances of hit is more, then the protection should also be increased to match it. But the challenge is that as the protection increases the meter turns to red and yellow. Also, the currency reduces as the protection increases. Insurance is also provided as three packages in different rates that is 25%, 50%,and 75%. We can choose whichever package we want. Insurance to be selected also depends on the currency the player is holding. The rates of package also depends on percent of losses covered. Depending on the currency held by the player the package can be selected and to that extent the currency gets reduced. The pods can be upgraded alternatively. Up gradation also requires currency. If the money required is there, then the pods can be upgraded. the main thing to be noted is that, if the comets hit the pods, it should be immediately recovered. All of these steps are to undertaken within the stipulated time. And within this time, the meter should turn to green, which means favorable. Also only if this is achieved, that level is won and one can move to next level. Managing all these tasks at the same time is the real challenge faced by the player. The player should see to that, the currency is increased, the pods are protected and the meter to be turned to green color. In order to manage this risk i tried upgrading the pods as soon as possible, so that it earns currency, also the meter also changes its color. Definitely, i played the game more than once. The next time when i started playing, i made sure first the protection is increased to the level of severity and chances of hit. Then, also I kept on upgrading the pods continuously. By playing this game, I learnt that as the game progresses, the risk also increases. Likewise, to develop and to protect a community, it is important to manage different aspects. As there is more development, the risk involved also increases. Therefore, timely protection and insurance to be given when required. Also, we should be able to recover when we incur losses. proper attention is required to complete this task. Dedication towards accomplishment of the level is also much more important in this game. According to me, this game is constructed correctly. But given a chance, I suggest that may be the pods size can be increased or the plot could be increased so that many pods can be built. Also up gradation of many pods at a time takes longer time. It can be made faster. A guard can be made available to protect the pods. But not for all the pods, only one pod with time limit.
