This game really frustrated me.To be frank, I had tried to play the game more than 30 times, and only succeed to reach level 2.Most of the time, I had failed in level 1. I had read and re read again and again the tutorial, and played using all the available tools interchangeable, but still could not pass level 2. Hence, I only get 5 % for this game segment in week 2. I really am dissatisfied with this particular game, and can say that I still cannot understand it.I am sorry, because I want to do well in this course. Last week quiz I got 15 out of 15, so I do not think that I should disappoint myself this week.Anyway, I hope there will be a better risk game in the future, if you choose to include any game in this course.Thank you.
