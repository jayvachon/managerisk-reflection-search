Basically,
if you want to get to the last level you have to take care about risk
management.The first
choice I made was how many buildings should I buy, and when to upgrade it,
because you have to save money for risk insurance and protection.And as the
game goes and meteorite fall, the research to minimize the uncertainly is what
tells you what to do next. How probably is that this meteorite impact? If ti happened
what is the damage it could make. So here is when the cost and losses analysis
come, and the coping with risk.It’s a clear
way to understand in a very ideal environment what risk management is, I Played
twice, and get level 5, I’m going try again just to the highest level.The real
Life isn’t so different, but deal with uncertainly and cost benefits analysis
is not that simply. We usually procrastinate a lot of decisions trying to
minimize the uncertainly, but is something we have to learn how to deal with
it.









I work as
an Operative Risk Analyst in a Financial company in Colombia (South America),
and  the way we make to cope with risk is
the same… first we have to learn about our environment (Meteorites) in our case
are our process, employees, customers and laws, and think about what kind of
bad things can happened, for example a risk of approve Credit Card to people
who are supplanting others just to make fraud. And there we go, our protection
in this case may be harder identity verification such as consulting risky
databases, verifying fingertips vs ID document, and some levels of approbation
and random assignation to credit analyst just to prevent inside fraud.
