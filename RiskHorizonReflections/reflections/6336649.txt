Playing this game raised many dilemmas in terms of how to balance preparation, insurance, knowledge and development, both with regards to time and money. Throughout the game it became clear that there was a very delicate balance between these components. Initially when playing the game, I spent too little time and money updating the pods, which would have immediate increases in development, and more on buying insurance and protection. I definitely underappreciated the benefits of knowledge and research with regards to mitigating risk, as this seemed like a distraction from focusing directly on the community. On repeating the game, I approached it by initially establishing an adequate level of protection, and then updating the pods as money became available, and spending the rest of the time researching the meteors. This allowed adequate time to establish community links and limited the damage. At times, high levels of insurance seemed like a waste of money, especially when damage could be avoided through other measures. However, on occasions when meteors did cause damage, insurance definitely paid off. This emphasises the long term benefits of insurance, and also changes how you play the game; knowing that there is a limit to the monetary cost of damage. In real life, this reflects changes in people’s attitude to taking risks once their losses are limited.After playing the game, it was interesting to examine what parallels there are to real world scenarios. Obviously, real-life risk management scenarios are significantly more complex than this one, with more society specific considerations and many more risk management issues and options, over a much extended time frame. This game highlighted how decisions undertaken by families, community leaders and governments could easily only focus on the development opportunities, or on risk alleviation. It also provided good examples of knowledge, insurance, protection and coping components of risk management, and how they operate as a highly-interlinked system. While I have lived most of my life in a relatively risk-free and well economically developed society, it would be interesting to see how the game may be played differently by those living in different economic and social environments, and whether these people would be more or less sensitive to risk. To reinvent the game, I would add some category to measure economic activity, such as employment and industry, as this would be a good measure of the wellbeing and social strength within a society.
