Risk Horizon Game
Reflection

 

     This challenging game taught me the fundamentals of risk
management – of how to gain the right mix of knowledge, protection and
insurance in order to cope with the damage caused by the risk, which, in this
case, was of the comet flooding the community.  It also helped me to understand that one of
the fundamental objectives of risk assessment was to pursue development.

      For my first attempt I only reached level 3 but lost out on
my time. I was playing it too safe when I bought the most expensive insurance
for every single level, leaving me with barely any money to develop new pods
that may have allowed me to pass level 3. I neglected protecting the community
by raising the platform; instead I was heavily focused on gaining more research
or knowledge about the comets. Unfortunately, at least half the comets struck
and although I did have insurance, I was not fast enough to make the
connections in my community necessary for no damage. When I realized that I was
doing something wrong, I desperately tried to change, however; I was too late
for I had already run out of time.

      This insight helped me to understand what I needed to do
differently when I played the game the second time. In my second attempt I
managed to lose out in level 5 but implementing what I had learnt about the
game from my first attempt. I learnt that the more risk protection I took, the
lesser the damages., I chose low level or nil insurance for all levels in my
second attempt and Instead, I used that money to build all my pods and
continuously upgrade them until I had about $50 left. I also raised the
platform this time so that it surpassed most of the comets’ severity meters. I
did do research but did not go overboard – instead I used that valuable time to
upgrade pods or raise protection. Every time I was hit, I made sure I made the
community connections quick enough. Clearly this was successful because I
suffered damages to my pods only once throughout all 5 levels.

     This showed me that although insurance is important, it may
not pay to over-insure if the chances of damages (like in this game) are not
very high keeping in mind that you have adequate protection levels and are
continuously developing the pods. The experience supports that risk management
is a key to development.

      If I were to change anything in the game, it would be to
perhaps introduce unavoidable risk.  Even
if we did research on the comets to avoid future risk, natural disasters can be
something completely unforeseen. Therefore, even if the chance of a hit is
non-existent, I would make the one or two of the ‘most-unlikely to hit’ comets
cause damage because the player would not be expecting it.
