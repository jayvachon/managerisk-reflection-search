I loved
playing the Risk Horizon game. I believe it helped me a lot to learn by heart
the core concepts of risk management we studied so far.

 The role of
risk management in the game was to develop the community of Alora. As the
community grew, it’s economy has developed and there was more money to spend on
new pods and in ways to protect them. I had to choose between the construction
of new pods, buying insurance, investing in protection and develop research to protect
Alora from the comets. As the community grew, I had to invest more in
preparation for risks so the community kept growing and I didn’t need to rebuild
the pods.

The game
seemed to be complex at first, but it concepts correlates a lot with what we
learned from the first two weeks of the course. So as I played the game, it
made a lot of sense to me why should I do research to avoid disasters from the
comets (you have to do research to prevent and prepare to great disasters), why
should I connect between the pods when a comet hits (the people in the community
has to help each other to cope with a disaster after it happens) and why more
pods would create more money (that would be a metaphor to economies of scale,
and also means that a more developed country has more money to invest in risk
management and it’s worthy to do it to keep growing).

 I wouldn’t
change a lot in the game, but it came to my attention that it’s possible to win
the game without buying insurance – that’s what I did, because it made my life
simpler.
