barThe previous stocks
affect protection and skill to manage them so feedback loop is there.Preparation means
efforts before the shocks.Knowledge means
research which gives higher time to build community support. Protection means increasing the height.
Protection mitigates impairment in growth after shocks. Insurance is to take cover. Coping involves
efforts after the shocks have occurred. This may involve building community
support, as the risk is systematic and repairing the damaged pods.Obstacles: only
resource constraint. To overcome the
obstacles: use community support in coping mechanism and manage cash and
time. Knowledge, Protection
and Insurance -- Choice and trade offDefer the insurance as far as I can to improve liquidity or
use money in some productive work. Insurance can be purchased immediately. But
I make sure that before any comet hit, I have insurance.For knowledge and protection there is a real trade off. Because either one can be improved at a time. Both
must to be managed and it’s a challenge.  Effects on growthThough protection slowdown growth and costs more than
knowledge it’s important because it will reduce impairment significantly after
comet hit. Knowledge doesn't slowdown the development rate and less costly. But
if damage occurs it will be huge damage without protection and development will
suffer.Answer 2:I have first defined variables
after my first attempt. Cash, Comets: Severity, Chances of hit, Research, Pods: Upgrades,
Development bar, Protection, Insurance: Cover, Community support. Leanings:Upgrade pods with either protection or research activity to
make efficient use of time, as they can be parallel.Defer insurance as it will improve liquidity, but take
before first hit.At the end of stage keep sufficient cash to meet immediate expense
like insurance in the next level. Sufficient protection and research is more preferable than
just upgrading pods to have sustainable growth.Manage cash at proper level. Excess cash is of no use.Observe development bar Green increase protection or researchYellow increase pods or upgrade themRed danger, repairPrioritize comets based on the severity, chances of hit and
speed.  Answer 3:Changes in gameParallel protection and researchBecause we need both and due to their serialized nature it’s
difficult to manage time constraint. In reality we can do both the things like gaining the knowledge and improve protection. Managing cash is a real world constraint but having cash means resources it should be allowed to have both research and protection simultaneously.Restart Policy















































































After game over, give choice to start from that level or beginning.
