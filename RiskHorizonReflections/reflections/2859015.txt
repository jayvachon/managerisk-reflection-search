The Risk
Horizon Game allows the player to experience risk management on a simple model.
While building and developing pods you have to deal with the danger of colliding
comets, that can destroy your settlement. 
It is possible to prepare for this danger by insuring pods, raising
protection or observing the comets. At the same time, these actions can be costly
or slow down your development. 

The most
effective way of avoiding danger from the comets was rising protection, but it
also meant spending money and halting the development of the pods. By spending
too much on it, you risked not completing the level in time. Insuring your pods
was costly and didn't offer protection from damage – it only lessened the costs
of repairs. At the same time it didn't halt the building process. Observing the
comets was helpful when it came to dealing with the damage, but wasn't as
effective as the other 2 options. In other words, the most effective way of
preparing for risk (rising protection), was the most damaging in the long run
by negatively affecting development. Observing the comets didn't cost anything, but could only lessen the damage. Insurance didn't protect from damage, it helped with coping with it. These two options didn't affect development in the long run, but where not as good with protecting form the imminent destruction.

After
playing I several times I learnt to first focus on the development and only after
that on preparing for possible crises. If I spent too much time on protecting
my pods at the beginning, I wasn't able to complete the level on time. The
second part of my strategy was balancing the observation of comets with a rising level of protection. I usually focused on this in the last minute of every
level, when I was sure I would reach the development goal. I spent my leftover resources on rising of protection, which better prepared me for the next level. In addition, careful observation of the comets allowed me to maintain a high level of protection throughout the game. In this way, even if I received damage, it was minimal. When I balanced these 3 elements properly (development, protection and knowledge), I didn't have to spend money on insurance.

The one
thing I would add, to make the game resemble real-life risk management, would
be a way to benefit from taking risks. For example, some of the comets could
provide additional income when they collided. Thanks to this improvement, every
risk could be a danger or an opportunity. The player would have to decide, if he is in a situation where he can risk a collision of a comet that could prove beneficial.
