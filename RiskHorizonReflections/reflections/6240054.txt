This game , I think , was a simple and funny game that represents how risk management could work for better life . When it came to trade-offs knowledge was on the top of my priorities , as it gave me information about the possible outcomes and shocks so I can choose wisely between the different ways to cope with the risk . Insurance , then , came in my priority list as it was really so helpful reviving the development process efficiently and save a lot of money in the time of crises so as if I'm transferring money from the time of stability to the time if crises and shocks . lastly protection comes to play a very important role which may reduce the severity and capacity of the shock when it hits  - or may even prevent it - . All of these had a great influence on development after some time ( at first ) but as the time goes on , its effect become more apparent .I played the game more than one time and each time I increase my concentration more on research as it was so apparent that it saves me a lot and made better development and it was a very good lesson to learn . Also , I learned from this simple game how to manage risk effectively and moreover with less takeoffs although , with better results and better outcomes .I think this game represent the different obstacles ( incentives , information and resources ) but it lacks the different behaviors hindering the development or change . Different behaviors may be presented which are affected through satisfaction , communication , taxes and etc .... . So when taxes are raised , for example , the satisfaction maybe lowered and this will accordingly affect the population's behavior which may resist change and make it more difficult to occur .All in all , this game is very exciting and taught me many things .
