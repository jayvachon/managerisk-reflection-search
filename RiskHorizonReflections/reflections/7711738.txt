Risk management played a key role in this game. From the start to the end of the game, knowledge was key to tackle the incoming comets and protect the pods accordingly, sustainable was key in this game keeping in mind the risk factors such as damage done by the comets. Insurance also played the key role in covering the damage done to the pods. Risk did affect the development as, I had to take calculated risk in order to make progress from one level to the another level. Development is key to the progress of this game and protection was important and having necessary knowledge was also key in-order to secure the proper development of the pods.I played the game couple of times, the first I played i missed the taking note of the knowledge of the incoming comets that affected my progress from one level to the another level.The second time i was more aware of the knowledge about the incoming comets, the severity and the chances of hits was the key to protecting the pods from the comets and understanding of the game improved with knowledge of the game.The things I learned are that, knowledge is key to progress of any community or organization and also key to risk management. Insurance is very important in the progressive development of any community or organisation, in this  case the development of the community of pods and covering the losses done to the organisation or any community due to any risk factor which might have gone wrong and affected the progress and development of the community. Hence we can say that insurance is a key in risk management. Coping is also a key factor in the risk management as losses and failures. In this case damage done to the pods in some cases are repairable with cost in mind.If I had the opportunity of developing a new version of this game, I would replace the pods with commercial enterprises behaving in a social scenario affected by changes in the stock market. The commercial enterprises would be affected positively or negatively depending upon how the stock market behaves, hence having knowledge of the stock market would be a key to this game because the player would be positively affected if he covers all his bases. Insurance agencies would also play a key role in handling the mutual funds which are subjected to market risks. Hence in this case helping the player by being a mediator. Coping with losses would be a key to this game because market would be behaving in a volatile manner and a better preparation for coping of failure or losses would be a key to this game. As I live in a city in which water logging is a problem and during monsoons risk of flood affecting our city is greater, hence I would propose a plan to tackle this water logging problem. Obviously to tackle the problem, the first stage would be knowledge about the proper drainage facilities available in the city and the areas where there is no drainage facilities. And then having a proper structure of how to lay out a plan in order to address the issues of areas having no drainage facilities. Secondly, sharing the problem with the concerned authorities, in this case the city Councillor and government authorities taking care of drainage facilities in the city. Thirdly protection and better preparation for the monsoons would play a key role. Lastly coping with this issues by the citizens affected by the monsoons is also important in order to neutralize the pain of victims.
