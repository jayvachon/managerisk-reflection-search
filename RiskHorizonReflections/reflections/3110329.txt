1. As I can see, the main objective of the game is building risk awareness and taking continuous actions for risk mitigation. Involves a process of risk assessment (analyzing risks as well as identifying), risk evaluation (comparing estimated risks with criteria established by the game) and risk mitigation.My strategy to pass to level 2 was continuously assess risks and also ensure the best conditions to address the risks. Coping with the consequences of risk after its materialization was very important to succeed.With some risks was very important to have the proper insurance (the building costs were cheaper), in other more research, if there weren't  imminent risks, was appropriate execute preventive actions.2. After the first time I played the game, instead of immediately trying once again, try to understand the problematic and actions had to do to reach the next level.During the game, try to remain calm and attentive, stay focused. The main lesson for me was: an effective risk management strategy needs to account for both the preparation for risk before it occurs and coping with the consequences of risk after its materialization. Learning lessons from a past risk that has actually occurred - a “materialized risk” - can certainly help design the preparation for risk.3.I would like a similar game but with another context. For example, based on the risks faced by a micro enterprise (SME). I live in Mexico and most of the companies are of this type. These companies are created so fast but also cease to exist very quickly, probably not knowing how to manage risks.
