The role of horizontal risk management in game was to handle with the subjects that have an interaction and  the decisions made could afect city development. In this role we had to have the view of whole subjects without priorisations. I choose a heavy investment in insurace and proctection that prejudiced the investments to development and it was my trade off. At the beggining the development was not hard affected but at next levels the city was damaged and didn't grow. If this game were played again i would have done a balanced investment in development , proctection, insurace and knowlagde. My sugest for next game concerned about collapse of slopes with heavy rain in summer in Brazil southest, then the subjects as prevention, proctection and development could also be taken in another perspective.
