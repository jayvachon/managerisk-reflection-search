The game showed me again, that we have to learn everything before we start to go to the field. I didn't checked all of the rules and I don't know everything about the rules. Without know the rules and the informations, we are not able to resolve the problems, so we can learn (and I learned) the have to now everything forprepaire the problems, before the problems arrive to us. Many times I forgot tolearned the rules and I not able to reach the final good archievments.About the game, I feel the research wieght is not enough and the clicking to the "fire" is not enough to show the problem and the power of the community.
