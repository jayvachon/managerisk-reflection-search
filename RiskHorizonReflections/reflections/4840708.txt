1) In this
game we had to manage risks concerning with threat of falling comets. In
particular, we had to evolve our city and simultaneously protect it from risks
(falling comets). I was making such decisions: what to build, to buy insurance
or not, to spend money to ascend land or to upgrade buildings, to spend time on
research or to enhance protection. Preparation for risk affected
 development by having to make the protection better and that slowed the
evolution of the city. Also, insurance policies need money what I could spend
to upgrade or buy buildings.
2) When I failed the first time, the next one I tried to look better at
maintaining the balance between buying insurance policies, building pods,
develop protection and making research of comets. Also I tried to devote more
attention to risk protection and insurance policies, especially the risk
protection. This happened because I saw, that if I have good protection against
comets, in bulk of cases I have no damage and this is pretty good :)   I
spent money to insurance policies only if I noticed the comet with very great
damage and very high possibility of falling in the sea near my island. Also I
 took into account the speed of comets. If they flew fast I research them
rather then spent money to enhance protection. 

 

3) I want to add to game different shocks. Not only
falling comets, but, for example, fires, hurricanes, storms, earthquakes,
plagues etc. In my opinion, this things make the game more realistic. Also it
would be good if this different disasters will be connected with each other to
make sinergetic effect. This cause more different methods of protection that
can be added to the game if we will use different shocks. 
P. S. I'm sorry about my grammar :) Unfortunately, I am too weak in english in
terms of speaking and writing. So, I am sorry again!
