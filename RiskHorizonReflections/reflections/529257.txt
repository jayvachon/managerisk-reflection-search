The choices trade-off was between the level of development achieved (time),versus research spend on
comet attacks in order to undestand patterns if any, insurance to reduce repair costs and protection to reduce the impact of shocks in amount spent in dollars. 
I did not reach a level of success in the game to utilize the community connection advantage.

In terms of development, I tried to vary the number of pods developed in multiple tries, and did not really see a difference to the success rate.in the alloted time. I tried the option of developing only 2 pods and upgrading them instead of all possible pods. However I found that in the given time the best I could reach was level 1 of sucess. So obviously it was not the best method, although cost was lower.

Higher insurance coverage did reduce the damage repair costs. I tried all 3 levels and found that optimization is possible once the comet hit pattern
is better understood and coverage is managed accordingly.

The most impact from damage was provided by the protection %. However this was the most expensive as well. In some of the tries, I ran out of wealth resources using too much protection.
Progressively,the reserach on the comets, helped to vary the protection percent based on the chance of hit. This freed up resources for devloping the pods. I was also able to better utilize the level of insurance and reduce the repair cost.

In summary, juggling between these multiple parameters to optimize development requires many iterations to gain knowledge. A balance between resources available and their optimum usage helps to increase the success rate.

If I had to redesign the game, I would enable an option to vary the number of pods to be developed. This will enable greater development of each
individual pod in the alloted time while saving resources for insurance and protection.
