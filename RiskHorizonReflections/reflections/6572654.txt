1. The role of risk is to protect Alora and his habitants, with risk we avoid the damage of the comets and the waves. For knowledge I only spend time but It was worthy because by just looking the comets I could see information about the comet and made the inhabitants of Alora made part of this knowledge.For protection I spend a lot of resources in elevating the Alora's base but It was the most worthy thing because almost all the comets that fall down in the planet make not damage because of the protection that I had bought. I bought the insurance from the third level, the best insurance that saved me of big damages of the high severity comets. The risk was crucial for development, It allows me to have development and at the same time be protected of the comets.2. I played it more that once, I think that along the games what I were learning was to balance how much to spend in development and how much in risk. A really important balance to reach the requirements of each level. I learned that risk worth the cost, also that knowing how to managed risk is difficult but that with every experience about risk I do it better, learn from failures is really important. Finally, also that the balance is something to really take care.3. Multitasking is really important for risk management it would be really important for managing risk to us to be allowed to make at the same time various actions risking the same resources.
