In our game, lr risk is a natural systemic risk: climate risk and a natural disaster and not a voluntary assumption of risk. This risk is falling comets surrounding sea of the city and triggering devastating floods and generates significant damage The role of any system of risk mangement (RMS) is to deal with the risk in preparing for the risk and deal with its consequences; it is necessary to reduce losses and opportunities. This system consists of: - Identify, prioritize and address the obstacles to risk management: identify the level of impact; the likelihood of achieving and rank risks according to their impact - Establish protective devices: purchase insurance and raise the city with the pillars to avoid flooding - Establish a system to cope with the consequences of the event is the help of the community and the insurance rembourssement - Adapt the development of the city according to the system of risk management to seize opportunities for change In this game; I tried to implement a compromise which consists of: - Identify and prioritize risk: the likelihood and impact of the shock of comets and prepare and maintain insurance protection before its completion and this with a reasonable financial budget and time budget that does not impact the development of city - Continue the development of the city, taking into account data from the system of risk management The preparation has influenced the development: - Immediately: the cost (in money and time) incurred for research and protection affects the development budget - After a while: the preparation helped save the city and therefore continue its development - So the system is an investment and not an expense or net loss For the game, when you play the first time, we do not know the subject well.
