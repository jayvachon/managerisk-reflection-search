The game incur in the many risk from allin objects which attack to the Isalnd. Most objects carry different level of risk and impact with attacking sensitivity. The base on the sensitivity we need to concentrate on how much damage can course. For the estimate the risk and minimise the damages, it is need to conduct the reserch. If higher sensitivity we need concentrate on the higher level of reserach wise versa. By doing reserch on risk we can quantify what dimention of damage which can be occure due to the coursative attack. By knowing the depth of risk we develop strateges minimise the damage. Insurance is the one of the instrument which can use for recover the damage but you can't recover the damage 100%. it base on the policy you are obtain, wether it is 25%,50%, or  75%. Hence it is most important activity to minimize the damage, it need hvae follow sevral steps to acive the effective results.Game teach us the think differently each time, mainly due to attack type and sensitivity are  different each time. It is pointed out that how much we needed to do the reserach on risk, how much we nned to spend on reserch. It guide us avoid the spend the resource avilable base on the sevirity of risk. Protection in habitat are the more prevelent protective methodlogy which can be utilized for many insidence in the real life. Real life risk avoidness also different each time and damage also get different in many time. To avoid  or minimise the damage we need to prepare with protective precoution each time. Game highlight that readiness what we need to develop ourself to stanby with higher risk.Game should be change with real life example such as foods, tsunami, hericane, etc,. It course for better feelings than currently experince. How much flood get impact on habitted, where the safe land avilable, and how can we raech it with time limitation will help to calculate the severity of risk and cost of be in safe side.
