1 – Risk management was needed in order to balance investment on growth and disaster prevention/remediation. Buying a good insurance only paid off when a strike happened, and it costed a fair amount of money, for only one level; protection on the other
hand lasted for all levels, but it was even more expensive, and with decreased returns. Preparation for risk paid off on the long run, when the strikes happened, the damages were either reduced or cheaper. 
2 – I would invest less on insurance on the initial levels. It’s easy to restart the game on the first levels, and the return for investing more on  development is higher. The most important thing I learned is that we always have limited resources, and we have to deal with it,
managing them properly. 
3 – I would add functionality that automatically calculates the expected damage from a given meteor. It would facilitate and speed up decisions.
