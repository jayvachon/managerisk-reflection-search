The game is a simplification of how risk management work in real life. You have your own goals (pass the level), you have threats (comets) but those are uncertain. Then, you must decide how you will deal with the threat. You can: Protect yourself, but this is very costly.Research the comet, which is very close to protecting yourself, but instead of money you waste time that could be used in generating more money or protecting yourself in a more direct manner.Buy insurance, but if damages are too high you may not recover in time.If you want to pass the level, you must learn how to better use all these instruments when managing the risks that the threats pose you. Spending money preparing for nonexistent threats will curb development, and developing without paying attention to risks is very unsafe, and will probably end in disaster.I played the game two times. The first time I completely ignored insurance, trying to completely protect myself. However, some threats are way too big and way too much unpredictable, and a comet with maximum severity hit me, destroying all my pods completely.In my second time I was doing much better, and I tried to better balance how I spent my time and money. In the end, again, a comet with maximum severity hit me and even tough I had maximum insurance, I didn't recover quick enough.If I had to develop for where I live, the game would certainly be about rain and dry periods. It is very hard to judge if the season will be about floods causing blackouts, destroying property and causing gridlock or if next season will be about the lack of water. In the last decade, the city where I lived was constantly ravaged by rain, but this year, we may face lack of water.
