 Q1

The role of risk management was:

to prioritize the needed
response to face the threats  vis-à-vis
following the developmental goalsto keep track of available
options of responseto have a holistic view of
the current situation and calculate the risksto distribute resources
between prevention, response and development.To understand the current capabilities
and what needs to be improved.The choices  tradeoffs between knowledge, protection
 insurance:

Knowledge cost less than
insurance and protection, so it was important to use it properly, especially
when I had time to react.Knowledge on higher
intensity risks was more important than knowledge on low intensity risks.Protection was a key
decision, even though it paused development. It was crucial to foster my
support system as much as possible.On the other hand, too much
protection was not a good option, and sometimes I had to let go and face the
hit, and after that calculate the costs of recovery.I relied too much on
insurance at the beginning because I knew that my preparation will not stand in
front of a strong comet. Later on, I chose cheaper insurance packages cause I
was better prepared.During the early phases of
the crisis, Knowledge was very important, and decisions regarding insurance had
to be made. But when the threat is imminent, protection was the key action.Preparation for risk affected development in different ways:

·        
As a general rule, preparation
reduced the financial resources available for development.

·        
On the other hand,
preparation allowed swifter recovery which helped me bring development back on
track.

Q2

After playing several times, I started:

Focusing on early
preparation as much as I can,Prioritizing the threats
according to intensity  speed,Delaying full scale
development until I had enough preparation,Choosing expensive
insurance when protection was inadequate, and less expensive insurance when it
was improved.I learned from the game:

How to handle resources in
times of crises, either financial or available time.Prioritizing threats
according to intensity to focus on severe ones, while not neglecting smaller
risks.I improved my grasp on the
dynamics of risk management, especially when it’s related to preventive measures,
the role of research, transferring risks, crisis response,,,Q3

If I propose changes in the game, I would have:

Focused on the response
part a bit more because it is crucial and has a deep impact on the rest of the
recovery track.Added other variables such
as food, water, shelter, energy ,,, to make it more realistic.Added various levels of
impact according to location and valueAdded the stability  security dimensions
