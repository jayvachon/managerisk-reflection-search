RISK HORIZON GAME this game was very informative and there was many things to learn, like risk management.In this game one could balance between natural disaster and rebuilding infrastructure with the help of managing risk, community involvement  insurance, in this game one could learn how we can overcome disasters such as Hurricanes, earthquake, e.t.c.we can minimize  the damages with the help of following 1. Infrastructure:                           To avoid such kind of natural disasters, one need to build proper and strong infrastructure, like building strong individual houses, high rise buildings , with proper material, follow certain building codes, standard safety procedures , proper building inspection and  maintenance should be carried out every year, proper fire extinguishing system should be there in high rise buildings,emergency exits should be made compulsory for each and every building. The buildings and Bridges should be built to such an extent so that they can with stand Earth quake and large cyclones so that they can help minimizing damages2. Vegetation:                      Vegetation plays a vital role in helping reduce damages , for example in areas where there are less trees and vegetation they are most vulnerable  to floods and soil erosion, that could cause lost of costly farming land and also increases the level of sea as more and more mud dumps in to the sea.to minimize the impact of natural calamities the societies/communities must discourage,  deforestation and grow as many tree plants as they can, and try to cover vacant area(soil) with green grass so as to stop soil erosion. 3. Community involvement:                                         Community involvement plays vital role either avoiding or minimizing  before or after Disaster effects, for example in sea cyclone region, with the help of latest technology (satellite data  local meteorological department) communities can keep an eye on changing weather conditions , building up high and low pressure, farming of cyclones their intensity and there point of impact, these are very important information for safety measures , with the help of these data communities can manage timely evacuation.one of the best examples is of Bangladesh where before community involvement there used to be huge destruction by Hurricane/Tropical Cyclone, in which hundreds of people died. after the use of technology and community involvement they were able to minimize the post cyclone effects, by evacuating to the safer point and adopting safety measures.4. Insurance:                   is the equitable transfer of the risk of a loss, from one entity to another in exchange for payment. It is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.Insurance can have various effects on society through the way that it changes who bears the cost of losses and damage. On one hand it can increase fraud; on the other it can help societies and individuals prepare for catastrophes and mitigate the effects of catastrophes on both households and societies.Some communities prefer to create virtual insurance among themselves by other means than contractual risk transfer, which assigns explicit numerical values to riskConsidering the response of risk management, the avoidance,transfer and mitigation of risk are all benefits, use of risk management can impact positively on the success of all development projects, there fore cost effective risk management plan can be used as a measure for effective change in society for better sustainable economic development in this game i tried to create balance between development , insurance and research, without balance it would have not possible to complete the game in this game i would like to replace small structures with small houses  buildings, vegetation with trees meteors with cyclones , near to the reality
