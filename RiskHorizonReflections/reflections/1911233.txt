I think the role of risk
management in the game was to balance continuing community development with the
possibility of damages due to natural disaster. Playing this game successfully
required some type of strategy, as you had to balance tradeoffs between development,
knowledge, protection, and insurance. The ultimate goal was to build a
community of pods and develop the area, but due to the constant threat of
comets, this task was not always easy. The knowledge gained through research of
the incoming comets was closely connected to the level of protection you could
build for the community. By knowing how severe the comet was expected to be,
you could proactively try to build your protection to meet the threat. This
protection could also be supplemented by the insurance you chose to purchase so
that your costs for repairing damages and making up for lost development time
were lessened. Preparation for risk had both immediate and longer term
consequences for development. The immediate consequence was less money to spend
on building and improving pods. The long-term consequence was that pods were
less likely to sustain a lot of damage if the protection level was high.

I had to play the game more
than once to achieve a desirable score. I think I definitely learned how to
strategize better the second time. You couldn’t just focus on protection and
not continue to build or improve your pods, or your development meter was too
low to move to the next level, no matter how little damage your community
sustained during the round. In my experience, it was also important to build
protection and purchase your insurance early on, in order to be ready when more
severe comets hit. That way, the pods did not sustain much damage, even when
the comet was expected to be severe.

If I were tasked with
developing a new version of the game, I would probably change the community
connections aspect (clicking to connect the gold bursts). It was unclear what
this part of the game signified. I think another way to represent
the community help would be another meter, similar to the protection meter,
which would show how much disaster preparation the community is taking prior to
a comet impact. In theory, this meter would represent supply stockpiling,
community education, and other measures not related to structural improvements
(since these are already covered by the pod improvement cost). It would cost
more as you got closer to a comet impact, in order to teach the importance of
planning ahead.
