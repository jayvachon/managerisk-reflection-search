The role of risk management in the game is to reduce the loss during the attack and be well prepare before a crisis happen. Most of the time, I rather invest a lot in investment and protection because they can help me reduce the loss to recover my city. After some time I build my city, I'll start purchase the insurance and increase protection.  I played the game multiple times, I change strategy for different time. I realize buy insurance at the beginning of time is such an waste. From the beginning of time, the crisis impact is small, so no need to care too much on research. I should develop the city as soon as possible first. So, I utilize the money to develop them. Then I realize I need to increase the protection later better because it is costly. When I see the initial research of crisis is big, I'll use my time to do the research. so that when crisis happen, I've more time to connect the communityIf I can add one simple thing, I would increase the preventive measure. For example, more facility to add on in order to reduce the cost,  like having a stronger wall with certain cost, More measure would of course decrease the severity of the loss and provide better protection to community.
