The game is based on choosing where to apply resources ( knowledge ), on development to gain more resources, on protection to prevent the flood and on insurance to minimize the loss in case of a flood. You have to manage the risk of a flood, while investing enough in production to win the level and enough in protection for not losing for a flood caused by a meteor.  My strategy was based on investing a lot in development in the beginning ,  to gain some flow of knowledge and have the resources to apply. On the firs attempt I bought insurance, on my second one ( I won level 5 and the game crashed ) I did not buy insurance, I invested a lot in my buildings and always get the green bar with some time left, and than I studied the meteors and invested in protection according to the maximum impact of them. So I manage to win investing everything I could in development, nothing on insurance and no more than I needed on protection, that was the best optimization for me. With this combination I could reach the green bar with a lot of time left.The help between the development spots, ( the ones you had to click after the flood ) didn't make a lot of sense to me, because you gain protection after the meteor hit. The community can't help between the meteor fall and before the flood, they can help prevent and reconstructing.
