The game shows how difficult is the choice among knowledge, protection and insurance, considering that you have a limited amount of resources to invest between risk management and development. On my first attempt, I invested a lot of money in knowlwdge, protection and insurance and I didn't reach the level of development needed. On the next attempts I invested more in protection and development and less in insurance and knowlwdge until I reached the equilibrium. The information about the severity and likelihood of impact was very important in the decision making process of knowing and purchasing insurance. But It is unclear how the knowledge helps to reduce the damage in the game. Unfortunately, I did'nd reach the end of the game. I have already imagined how difficult is to the politicians to deal with the trade-offs they confront every day. Thus, it seems that the ability (skills) of politicians and their teams is increasingly important, given that cities are increasing and resources are increasingly constrained. They have to be able to understand how to manage risks in an adequate way to ensure that their objectives shall be achieved. They also have to build communities connections to enhance their capacity to face potencial threats. The knowing phase has to be structured with mecanisms to identify and analyse risks, including their severity and likelihood. And, most important is the ability to identify their nature and complexity. And monitoring emerging risks is also a very important task that has to be done. A good framework of risk managing has to have an efficient and effective  mecanism to measure  the risks mitigation efficiency and the residual risks.  The civil society and non-governmental organizations should charge more transparency and greater participation in decision-making on investment and public expenditure processes, given that citizens suffer from bad choices. In Brazil, there are a lot of cases of bad choices that undermine people related to projects that are priority only for the politicians. The World Cup is an example. Instead of building soccer stadiums, why didn't the government buid schools and hospitals? Yesterday, a viaduct that was not already ready, since the schedule was delayed, collapsed and two persons died. I played the game several times only to understand how to play it. The protection slider seems that it doesn't work well and sometimes the player doesn't know if the insurance was puchased or not. When the game shows the percentage of the damage, this percentage is related to the amount of money invested? Ii would like to propose that instead comets, the game uses situations of floods and droughts with fire, depending on the seasons of the year.
