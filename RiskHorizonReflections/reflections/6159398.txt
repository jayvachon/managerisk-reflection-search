To start with, i could not really get going in the game , i just dint get how to properly play the game although i had a clear ideal of what the game was all about.As regards the reflective essay i would say the role of risk  management in the game played was simply to safe guard and insure against an upset in the development of the community -more precisely it was the management of assets and capability to minimize the adverse effect  of the impact of the meteorite resulting in flooding and other damages. to choice was to acquire knowledge on meteorite  through research at the expense of continue development of the community (building hubs), also the funds available to me was used to purchase the best insurance available ($175). The preparation  for risk had an immediate impact on development of the community in that rather than building more hubs i spent more time on the research.At first i sent more time in developing the community and less time on the research but i found out that with each meteorite hitting the community most of my building suffered severe damages, so i decided upon playing the game again to spend more time on research. i learnt from the game that the the findings that is knowledge that would be gained from the research were more important than continuous development of the community , as in the beginning where my aim was to first build as many hubs as possible.The insurance was also very helpful as it mitigated the damages after the meteorite hits as insurance pays part of the repair money.To add to the game i would look at adding time option to see how individual would handle time management. that is i would give a time frame on when the meteorite would hit and see if people would consider an evacuation plan early or actually wait and believe they have adequate plans to survive the hit. Furthermore, that would be targeted to actually see how behavioral denial works
