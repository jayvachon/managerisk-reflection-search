Risk Management assisted in reducing the impact of the disaster that occurred during the game. Although there were damages but they were reduced through the assistance of protection, insurance and research. At some points, I opted for protection  but it wasn't the best at all times. At some point, I took up a research methodology to be sure of the impact of some hits. Finally, insurance was the lender of last resort. I took mostly 75% cover which reduced the burden of expending the available resources. It gave room to focus on other areas in the economy which required attention. Some decisions were meant to tackle immediate situation while the others are long term based. It depended on the situation at hand. Though I played the game many times. The lesson here is to prepare for risk adequately and also be able to cope with the effects. If I had one chance to do something differently based on the game, I would love to create 100% insurance cover. This way the government is assured of no expense incase of disaster. However, it has its own negative side, premium would increase and it might seem like nothing is derived especially if no disaster occurs. What I did differently was to take time to reflect on the three (3) -  preparation, research and insurance. I discovered that insurance was not the best responses or tool for risk management. I discovered that research and preparation were perfect for some cases. If I had the chance to develop a new version of the game, I would actually prefer to have other measures of risk management. Then to have an analysis on the effect of every action encountered during the game. Right now, I would also make grants and aids available to countries especially the developing ones who may not have all the resources to conquer risks and build resilience. I would also give room for time frame when it comes to redeveloping the economy. There should be a way to also assess what other countries would do if they had the same issue as the native country. This will give insight on some decision making criteria. It would also give insight on the consequences of some decisions. There should also be a chart preferably a graph to depict the booms and slumps experienced in the economy while playing the game. It would give better understanding.
