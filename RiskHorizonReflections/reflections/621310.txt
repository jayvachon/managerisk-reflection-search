The goal of the game was to
achieve development goals, defined as a level of wealth measured by the meter
on the left.  The player’s
challenge was to monitor current assets (pods), financial resources
(cash flow),and known risks (tides resulting from comet landings) and allocate
resources to maximize the development outcome, by (1)
investing in improving, repairing, or adding to assets, and/or (2) investing in
defensive strategies to protect those investments.   Attention
and cash were the resources which could be used to acquire and improve assets,
knowledge, protection (including community connections) and insurance.   The game required constant
awareness of both the opportunities for development and the realities of the
risk environment in order to manage the trade-offs of investing money and/or
attention (with its opportunity cost) on one strategy as opposed to another.I
was initially too preoccupied with risks, invested too much time on knowledge
(“research” on advancing comets) and protection (shoring up the island), and
purchased the maximum level of insurance.   Attempting the game again, I gave more
attention to building and improving my pods, recognizing that knowledge,
protection and insurance were to serve development progress (more and better
pods), which I had slighted earlier; and I modulated insurance better.  I learned that monitoring and
managing risk needed to support, not override, an aggressive development
effort.  Time was a tough challenge,
however, and even my more aggressive strategy on the second try was
insufficient to advance me past Level Two.





Where I live, the role of government is a very conspicuous
factor in development progress.  If  were re-designing the game, I would add an
element for investing in institutional capacity-building (good governance,
functioning financial and legal systems) as another strategy that would have a
protective function and add to wealth.
