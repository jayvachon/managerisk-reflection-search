The aim was to manage between knowledge around comets, protection against comet so as to progress with building pods (development). Insurance played a very effective way to save on the initial investments you made to build up the pods. Comets which cannot be avoided would cause destruction to pods, hampering your development, but insurance help reconstruct them at lower costs. But at the same time research included investing time in knowledge which would help in protection. This reduced the speed of development. And also gave less time to reach protection levels.I played this game quite a few time, trying to balance the three - knowledge, protection and development. One thing i made sure was to buy Insurance every time i saw a comet with high likelihood to hit. This helped me save money to repair and build. But even with that strategy I couldn't go beyond level 3. I learned, I wasn't able to restrict the damage a high severity comet caused. Every time i lost was because i couldn't recover from the severe damage in given time limit. The developers gave a great thought to the making of the game. Only thing i would like to add to the game knowledge input to the level of protection. I tried to gain as much knowledge as possible about high severity comet before they could hit. But after investing so much into comet readings my protection level should have improved with same amount of efforts. Or at least readings should have acted as inputs to protection technique. But I wasn't able increase any significant level of protection to pods.
