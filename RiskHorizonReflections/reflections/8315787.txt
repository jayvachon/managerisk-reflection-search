This
game was very informed as it teaches the position to manage risks in the well-organized
way. It was in fact
it was a stimulating understanding to learn in what way risk management is
important for oneâ€™s healthy development through this game. The tutorial given
for assistance helped to learn about the game more in deep. Being the luminator
of Alora, my task of developing this public by meeting certain indicators in
the ways was really hard and thought provoking. Being the Luminator of Alora, the
task given was to develop the public by forecasting risks and to make sure that
there is progression in the society. It was a very stimulating game as it
enables us to take decisions and take the right amount of risks by examining on
them. By building pods, the rate of extension would growth and thereby making
the environment much safer.

It
was important to note that there should be a sense of stability during as we
had to check for few parameters before we could develop and safeguard the land.
This aspect taught me the consequence of accountability that we possess in our
lives to take care of the setting we live in and also to take considerable
amount of risks on an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the municipal
to bear the shocks but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It
is indeed really important to research on the risks that come our way and
eventually develop on a protection plan to minimize the damages from it.

Alora
falls victim to falling comets; these comets careen into the water and cause
waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between
growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.

While
playing the game for the first time, I had controlled myself to only 25%
insurance, but as I moved on, it was important to take bigger risks and hence
had to increase the insurance to 75%. Though building pods was important to
develop the land, insuring them against meteor waves was equally important.
Thereby, it was important for me to strike a sense of balance between time,
money and the resources at all points during the game.

The
authority to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet drumming,
the time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyze the
different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By
doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of
time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection

Playing
the game for the first time you will definitely find it problematic to admittance
the amount of risk involved and possible penalties of it you may have to face
if hit by the unexpected factors, But given a chance to play again you will
certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting
attacks of damage based on previous experience. 

If
given a chance to advance a new version of game we could probably include the
role of funding groups within the civic who could perhaps pool adequate money
and help each followers with the group economically in times of need. They
could also take up a group assurance policy to anticipate and manage their
risk. They could deliberate within the groups their past involvements of risk
and share within their group.
