With every passing level the amount of risk due to comets increased and it required greater adroitness to mitigate risk. It is said that knowledge is power . Data is basic and is largest in amount . On refining data , one gets information which is lesser than data  in amount but  more useful than data . Further , on refining information , one gets knowledge which is least in amount but most useful and potent . Therefore in order to do proper risk management , it is imperative that adequate research  be done to gather relevant information and knowledge about the comets causing damage . about insurance and other risk mitigating factors . Sufficient research is necessary pertaining to the telescope window  which opens after the comet is selected . Choices made and trade offs confronted in terms of knowledge , protection and insurance :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Different choices were made at different levels of the game . In the preliminary level  the quantum of risk was less and therefore one could dispense with insurance or go in for an insurance of lower value . In the subsequent levels the degree of risk accentuated thereby making it necessary to opt for the highest insurance value and also press the protection bar into use .  Preparation for risk to help development :--------------------------------------------------Preparing for risk in advance by opting for protection and insurance helped in coping with the damage and the after  effects . Research helped in assessing the amount of risk and the measures needed to counter it . Different approach after playing the game for the first time  :---------------------------------------------------------------------------After playing the game for the first time , the importance of protection and insurance increased . It was thought prudent to purchase insurance even when the chances of risk and damage were low . Community connections also became more relevant in order to cope up with the damage and reduce it  as much as  possible Main things learned from the game :---------------------------------------------(a)  Insurance is very important as it takes care of foreseen and unforeseen risks and threats .(b) Do adequate research so that one is well equipped to tackle a risk .(c) Build community connections so that risk can be shared and therefore handled more easily . (d) Be prepared for the damages or consequences caused by a threat . Change in the game proposed :-----------------------------------------Wealth is one of the most important factors that offers protection . More wealth can reduce risks immensely . Another source of wealth to keep the coffers full could augment development at a much faster pace and reduce risk very much .
