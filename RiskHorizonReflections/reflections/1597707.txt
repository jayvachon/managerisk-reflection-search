1-Risk management in this game is a powerful instrument for development; the whole game is about achieving the goals of building and developing pods while anticipating the future risks coming from comets, these risks which if ignored, can turn into crises affecting the whole process of development and causing damage to the pods.Based on the preferences for risks of comets and the knowledge of potential outcomes and respective probabilities. All the time, I have to go through building and developing the pods .but in the same time I never take my eyes away of the comets the major source of risks.throughout research and making suitable balances between the costs of protection and the costs of insurance according to the degree of severity of the risk and chance of hitting,On the other hand, I have a limited resources time and money, so I have to take care of the researches which help to define a suitable plan to confront the comets.First of all I have always to improve my insurance plan according to the cost I can afford, so if the severity is high I have to raise protection, up to a suitable level yet not to raise it too much if I have a costly insurance plan because this will cause a loss in resources in terms of money and time.The preparation for risk through research, insurance and protection help in minimizing the damages, reserve the resources and  make compensation for the damage , which helped immediately in repairing the damaged pods and help in long term when moving to the next levels.2-I would pay more attention to the trade off  needed between insurance and protection because at first I used to raise both which caused huge loss in money and time and so I lost the levelWhen I played several  times I learned to continuously improve my pods and I noticed that building them close to each other make them stronger  in facing the possible  damage indicating the importance of communication and power of communities  that makes the community more stronger.Several things I have learned from this game:I learned the importance to pursue opportunities and confront risk as a fist component in risk management.I learned from the game how could the risk management act as a powerful instrument for development through interaction between three disciplines which are: research or knowledge, protection and insurance.Also I learned the meaning of trade-off to increase resilience to negative shocks.I learned the meaning of management of limited resources and how these resources can be efficient managed to achieve the development goals.And finally the power of communications between community as a tool for confronting the different risks.3-I think I would add the ability to make more researches about the comets for an extra cost because if I have enough information and knowledge , it would help in producing a more efficient trade off process and might decrease the cost of protection and insurance .
