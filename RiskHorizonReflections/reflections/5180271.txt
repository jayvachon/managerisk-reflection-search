1. This game provides us with the basics of risk management in a recreational yet informative manner.Risk management in such scenarios is very critical, so as to minimize the after effects of a disaster or to avoid the shocks on the whole. One must take into account the factors such as the severity, aid/insurance, and also very important is the research; which help us to understand how prepared we should be, or what level of preparedness we should reach in a particular amount of time.With proper research, we can determine before hand, what level of protection is required, how necessary is it to be insured and to what level must we be insured. However, we must not focus completely on the research, hindering the development of the community, which is the actual purpose.Not all disasters can be avoided always, so prompt and effective repair/damage control is also very important. Research need to be dont before hand focusing on the aftermath of the disaster and how it can be dealt with effectively.2. I had played the game more than once, during my first go, i didnt pay any particular importance to insurance, as i was focused only on preventing the disaster. That proved ineffective.    Insurance is also a prominent factor in risk management. it help to save our funds, which can be used else where, which require it more.    Also another important lesson was not to waste too much time/ funds on research of non threatening events.     As i kept playing, i started developing the pods even faster so as to maintain an optimum amount of funds.3. although the game encapsulates the essence of risk management perfectly, if i were to make changes, they would be, periodic insurance payments, variable protection systems(other than raising the ground), special pod updates which are damage resistant.
