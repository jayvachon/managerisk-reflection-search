As the saying goes "No gain, without Pain", justifies that Risk Management was necessary to be undertaken in the game for the development of the community.The life style of the people is measured with the help of the Development Index of that community. Development needs resources, resources need technology and technology needs research. A community struggling for its setup can not think of investing in research areas because of its high costs and complexity. Investment in Research arena is a huge challenge and is full of risk. After crossing through this start up phase, resources can be pooled accordingly and then be invested in the research area. In the context of the game,a balance was needed between the growth in the development percentage and the level of the ground barrier( symbolizing technology) to be raised. Moreover, Research was also important because it helped the community to tackle and cope up with the losses. The more time the community spent on this area, the better information it had accumulated. Plus, preparedness through research also enabled the community to spare some time towards better communication and faster rehabilitation. An area to be focused by any developing community is the importance of having a good communication network. An Adhoc Network must be set up in every disaster prone area to have an emergency contact with the habitats. Sometimes this emergency network can prove to be life saving medium of communication post a disaster. Survivors can help each other during these crises time so that losses can be minimized. During a disaster, their is a huge loss of life and property. Life losses can not be prevented, but after shocks due to loss of property can be minimized. One of the effective way is to undertake a better insurance policy which will help to cope up with the losses in minimum costs and investment. Insurance provides a back bone and courage to actually adopt risk for a better opportunity. An insured person can undertake more work and can utilize resources in a better manner. One hard truth that nature displays is that the time and resources that have to be utilized for the development scheme,some of them have to be used for preparedness against any disaster. That results in slowing the development rate. Playing the game again after initial experience, taught me to have a proper balance between development and preparedness towards disaster. In my first attempt, I was focusing more on development neglecting the need to be prepared for a disaster. As I went through, I understood that the whole process of development will be destroyed, rather slowed down, if the community is not prepared for the disaster. So, in the next attempts, I had reserved some resources for research and preparedness. Most importantly, the game taught me that disasters are unavoidable, we can not stop them but we can mitigate its effects and after shocks. Sometimes, after shocks of a disaster leave a long lasting effect on the life of the effected people.The game presently focuses on how an individual thinks for the community in the game. It does not relate any content on how team work can actually help to cope up with the losses. Moreover, when the player spends time and resources on research, he is actually blocked to undertake any other work, for example construction. It would have been better if multitasking and team work would have been a part of this game. With Risk and Management, the player would have also learned about team work and the need for multitasking, given that the resources are available to the community.Â
