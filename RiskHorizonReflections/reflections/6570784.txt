The purposes is pods built and upgrade pod to higher level
from 1 to 6 on time against comets. There are three choices for managing the
risk as;

- knowledge in research term by
getting comet’s velocity delay,

- protection preparing by holding
the bottom as long as the severity of the comets,

- insurance  purchased in high cost as amount of the
development done.

Trade off,-  many building and upgrade pods are more
development cost, but it is more percentage of damage when the comets missed that insurance is paid by the development cost less,

-  comet’s information declared for getting the severity and chance of hit, including time delay by research
level. Playing and strategy;

- trying to protect comets missed and  build more number of pods and update to higher level in order.

- Level of protection is higher and equal the
severity for higher illustrator in green by comets information.

- Purchasing insurance as chance of hit by guess to cover the damage.

- The main thing that I learned that there are no
damage occurred or less damage less than insurance purchased and always keep the illustrator green.For difference playing;-  Planning to arrange development cost for pods built and update, protection cost and insurance purchased.- During the game, keeping comet's information is carefully investigated for getting more insurance and protection.- Trying no pod damage happened, or few damage less than insurance for repairing the damage.Lesson learning;- planning and resource distribution are most important for pod's development, insurance purchase and research,- community must be safe by protection,- insurance has to prepared,- research should be investigatedConclusion, the resources should be divided in ratio by approximate and left some resource for the severity change to higher level and insurance in the future. The development version;- research effect should be more identify than the current version.- pooling or cooperate insurance should be verified and before damage happened.- highest level should be declared.
