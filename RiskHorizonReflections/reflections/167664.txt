The role of risk management in this game is crucial, as the game is based on development and the probability of loss. The game in general illustrates different strategies of risk management. However, the game is structured strangely, as it leads to most definite end even if a little damage is being suffered by the player. This severely limits the use of insurance. I played the game several times. the more I play, more it is difficult to achieve the balance of between instruments. The more it is becoming apparent, that available risk management instruments are able to deal with limited so much loss, and after that, one needs to develop something new, or move to another planet! 
  
If I could improve this game, I would add numbers - how much wealth per house per minute, how much of it is improved by the upgrade etc. Risk management without the numbers seems like blind people playing football.
