This is a very informative and interesting game in the sense that inorder to complete my task in the given time inspite of coming across multiple obstacles like comets in this scenario, I had to strike a complete balance between all the three activities. I have to keep on planting pods, I have to buy insurance and I also have to make my village strike proof. This not only involves time management but also resource management. Choices and Tradeoffs:1. I have to keep on planting my pods so that I will not left without pods before the time expires. 2.I have to keep track of the severity of the commets and ensure my village can sustain them by providing protection.3.I insured my village using the minimal insurance available as i already provided protection to my pods. This way, I am able to manage resources.I attempted this game multiple times and I was not successful the first time. Some times, I was providing a lot of protection. So I was not left with enough resources to create my village. The other time, I was just planting the pods, which didnt leave me an opportunity for disaster recovery. I realised the importance of insurance and balance. The third time i attempted, I could strike a balance between all these activities due to which I completed the game successfully.Along with protection and insurance, I would like to incorporate a growth mechanism using which I can be scored against the number of pods that I am able to plant in addition to the minimum required ones. This gives me a chance to understand how much extra i could have performed under the same given scenarios.
