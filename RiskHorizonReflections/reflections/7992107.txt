First of
all, playing this type of game is not my cup of tea ... I find it rather
enervating. However, I do understand that in order to win this game, you have
to keep track of your financial situation, get as much knowledge as possible of
the risks surrounding you (i.e. the comets that might hit with no, slight or
severe damage), protect yourself (although I did not figure out which button I
needed to press here) – I guessed staying away from the coastline was wise in
order not to be hit by the waves caused by the impact of the comets in the sea.
Buying insurance seems a sensible option, but again this depends on how much
money you can spend on it and whether it is important to build all the pods on
all the foreseen building sites or whether one could live with the idea of only
setting up a few of them. I wanted to gain more knowledge but wasn't sure where to get it and I must admit the comets followed each other at a frightening speed which made me quite nervous. Keeping calm and acting swiftly also seem to be necessary for crisis management.

The first
time around I definitely spent too much money on insurance. So, the second time around I kept a closer eye on
my budget.

If I were
to play it again, I would try to gain more knowledge and get protection at a decent level at a reasonable price, before
buying insurance coverage. These are exactly the three elements I have learned about basic RM in this game.

If I could change anything to the game, I would
make the protection options clearer and more visible: building a dam to stop
the waves from coming inland; installing rockets to shoot the comets to pieces;
building shelters to help evacuate people; investing in impact forecasting; … Finally, I guess for young people (or fans of video games) this game is self explanatory, for me it was a bit confusing, but I did get the gist.
