The game was quite addictive. I spent a lot of time on it but was unable to get to level 3, perhaps because raising the level of the island was extremely slow on my computer and there were also delays doing "research".1. The main trade off was that it was necessary to develop as fast as possible while doing enough research to reduce damage. There was feedback between rounds about the trade off between characteristics of a risk (intensity and probability), level of preparation and damage. However this was not easy to interpret. There was much more sense of continuous "fire fighting" than actual risk management.2. Eventually I stopped getting insurance before it was necessary. I am not sure that this was a good thing to learn. I learned that in setting peer review essays like this the World Bank is merely going through the motions of spending a budget on education rather than actually helping people to learn.3. Don't use such an action oriented game. It does not represent risk management choices but real time reactions.
