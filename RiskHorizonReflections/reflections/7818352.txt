1.Risk management played the major role in this game. The effective use of insurance both helped to prepare for and cope with risks and disasters and made investemtn sustainable and relativly safe. By investing into insurance the cost for coping with he outcomes of natural disasters were much lower. Also the time spend on rebuilding was shorter if the buildings were insured. Of course investment was another major key to develop. In conjunction with insurance one was able to build a sustainable community which is prepared for risks and coping with the outcomes of risks. 2.At the beginning I did not spend enough money on insurance and the cost for rebuilding were to high to reach the goal of the level one. The second time I invested into the highest category of insurance: As a result I reached the goal of the level and invested in every of the following level into insurance. The more developed the community was the more the income increased which has been another factor for growth. If one insured the community sufficient, the money spend on rebuilding was much less and one had more money to invest into new buildings.  3. If I had to redesign the game for my on place, I would include more democratical action. For example that one could ask the community what their most urgent needs were. Of course, the game is oversimplified to focus on the main narrative of insuring probably to be prepared for risks and to cope with the results of risks/disasters.
