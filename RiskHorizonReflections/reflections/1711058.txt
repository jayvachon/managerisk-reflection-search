The role of the risk management game was to make us think about how to balance healthy economic development with appropriate risk mitigation preparation. It is very common to see communities solely focusing on economic development while ignoring potential risks that could limit that development in the future. The game makes us think about the importance of balancing development with risk preparation in order to foster growth in a community. One important lesson is that committing time and resources to risk prevention is crucial for growth but that spending too many resources on them can also have a negative impact in the development of a community. Also, when dealing with risk mitigation, it is very important to balance research, preparation, and insurance. Those three tools are crucial for appropriate risk mitigation. After playing the game the first time I learned some important lessons that allowed me to do a better job on my second try. On my first attempt I failed to do enough research on the meteors and focused more on buying insurance and developing pods as quickly as possible. I realized that gaining knowledge on each meteor was crucial to prepare and respond to to their impacts. The more time spent on research, the more time I had to respond to the impact of meteors. If I was tasked with developing a new version of the game, the one change I would implement would be to add other risks other than meteors. Another natural disaster, one that occurs with less frequency but  that can have an even greater impact in the community like a flood, would better represent the risk management choices where I live. Most communities have to deal with risk management of different natural disaster and decide how to allocate resources between them.
