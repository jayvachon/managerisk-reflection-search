The Risk management in the game was very important to act quickly and to take into considerations the potential threats. In the game I had to put resources in the protection to avoid a backlash since I was building rapidly. This helped me by protecting me so I can focus on building and research and with prompt response to shock I occurred no damages.I learnt that it is very important to response as soon as possible and what is the value of time, in case of a shock research provided response time which could be and very important factor when safeguarding oneself. By constantly increasing protection I was able to gain a better chance and thereby reducing the need for hefty insurance.Insurance was also important as in case of a very large shock it was possible to receive damages even after have protection and research, thus when I did received a damage I was able to cope with the damages and rebuild.But the biggest factor to success was mostly depended on avoiding damages with better preparations and quick response in case of a shock.When I first played this game I focused on everything without any strategy but afterwards I learnt to build a strong suit in form of a system to handle the shock, by playing again I focused on rising my protection as much as possible without affecting required growth. By this I was able to develop with ease. This was important that I develop a strategy and it required that I learn from experience no one could achieve best result in one go we all had to learn from experience.To improve the game I would suggest to add different forms of shock which might not agree with each other as a protection for one may not be protection for other thus different risks require different protection, this way the player can learn to find a equilibrium between them.Thus by only focusing one source of shock the comets one will have to deal with variety of things as is in the case of real life world, we face various type of risk and we prioritize not only our time to dealing with them but also our resources.Overall the game was a great learning experience which can be frustrating as is in real life when dealing with crisis and we learnt how to deal with it by learning from it to achieve better result in the future.
