The role of ris management in the game was to achieve sustainable development of the community exposed to catastrophe. I have to use knowledge, to research about severity and chance of a loss, insurance protection and physical protection simultaniously. However, taking insurance took money necessary for the development while physical protection slowed down the develoment and took money also. The balanced develompent was the essential ingredient to move to a further level. Preparation cor risk affect the develompent immediately.Â I played game several times. Each time I used different tactics for the develompent of objects but have always used knowledge, insurance and protection. Sometimes I bought more and sometimes less insurance, sometimes I used more and sometimes less research as well as protection. The main thing I have learned from the game is that develompent should always be related to external influences and be founded on sustainable basis. Sustinable development means to develop each and every one at approximately at the same level so you could adequatly financd the repairs from disasters. You should buy insurance to help you sort out the inadequte own resources and also invest in knowledge and protection from disasters that hinder tbe development.If I could develop a new version of the game, and be allowed to change one thing, that one thing would be the way how protection is used. The use of protection is not inuitive as it does not spend enough money from available resources. In a real world protection is often very costly. Also, the use of the protection should be visible through sa some bank development or there should be options for different types of protection with different costs.
