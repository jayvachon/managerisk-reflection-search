1) I played many times and what I understood is that the "risk management" in the game played a big role. I understood the role of each variable (protection, research and insurane) and step by step I could manage all those elements toghter in order to increas my development level until Lev 5. Unfortunately, I didn't reach the Level 6 yet. But I understood the mechanisms and it was possible only doing, making mistakes and change the approach to the same problem (the same context but different stategies).2) The main things that I learned are: a) the possibility to learn by doing something (for instance, the first time the comet hit me and I didn't purchased the insurance. I failed; b) managing more tools at the same time. If I played only once I would give more attention to this way of acting, managing at the same time more elements, and if I played more than once it would be easier to reach everytime a little more knowledge and experience, in order to reach the final level.3) I will add the possibility to improve knowledge after research progress into Technical products/innovations. For instance, after 1-2 times of a full complete research I will allow the players to build a defensive weapon capable to hit comets. Each full research will imply the possibility to increase the level of efficiency of the weapon. Togheter with the capability to defense the planet. Critical aspects: as player in a game we have the total control of the context. As external the player look on an object but it's not into this phenomena. In the game we didn't face with the "obstacles", those from human behaviour or similar. It was really easy to manage just three elements, but however I didn't reach the Lev.6. In reality it will be of course different. We can count on cooperation and community support, for instance. Or, really important, in the possibilty to plan a strategy with others.
