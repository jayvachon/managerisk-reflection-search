First of all It is a useful , applicable , good game .. i found the enough example in understanding of risk managment , which had the big role in winning the game , by the effective Scientific using of researches , protection button and trade-offs i could protect my self from the comets..in our world's firms we could apply all of these components to protect our businesses and make it able to face risks, threats, and other outside conditions. in our life there are many kinds of shocks (famine, floods, economic collapse...) all of  these we could face if we really apply what we learned from the game.while playing and when i gave the researches long time, i had the enough time with community connections so it helped me in long term protection  and insuranceconnected Neighbors  and community organizations help one another when a shock comesby sharing resources forming and sustaining . So the role of risk management is so clear through making the player confront risks. the most important choise must be taken when more than one comet appears in this case i spent some time on research to build some knowledge then i came back to the protection button to make the ability of protection larger than the damage that would happen if the comet hits me and it works .. when it hits me  i use the community connections and in a few time it says (NO DAMAGE).the main idea of the role of risk management in the game is about keep building and upgrading of pods even when the player is protecting or doing researches so the business must be continued even under the risks.when i played the game for the first time i didn't understand everything , i didn't had the enough knowledge of how to be safe from risks.. so i started with tutorial version and i repeat it more than once til i understand every thing about bulding , protecting and the coordinating between them, and this explains what i learned from the game about this coordinating between protecting ,keeping my business on, and doing researches, another thing i leaned is about the right using of time and resources in confront of the risk.when i think about developing the game i have tow ideas the first is increasing the threats that the player face such as existing another Aloras which are bulding and developing pods and gaining a lot that will reflect the risk of having  competitors and how i must play to be better than them, the second idea is to limit the resources and the money that i could use to protect my self so that will offer a good knowledge about using a limit buget to face a larg risk.
