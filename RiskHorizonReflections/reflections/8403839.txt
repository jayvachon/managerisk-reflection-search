Risk horizon as written on main panel of website is   ”a real time strategy game that teaches how
and why risk management is important for healthy development” .The game is
about development of world of Alora and protecting it from attack of comets
.The game demands player to manage risk effectively .In the game the player has
the abilities of research, protection and insurance .But all these abilities
cost heavily on player which somewhat slows down the process of development.
So, game exactly demands the player to develop the word of Alora and protecting
it along the way which is only possible if player takes risk. In fact, the game
is simple and best demonstration of importance of effective risk management.  I did not play the game once. I played the game more than
one time .When playing for the first time, I was unable to make good strategy
to cope with the circumstances, but I realized my faults, addressed to them and
played game again with strategy and result was excellent .The strategy I used was
basically to manage time such that while protection was built, rate of
development was slow .But when enough protection was built, I made my efforts
to increase the rate of development as higher as possible.The things I learnt from this game in perspective of our
true world was “Effective Risk Management” that is to acquire knowledge about
the expected events, cope with them, preparing for them and to make development
by availing opportunities.





The game, no doubt is an excellent demonstration on how to
manage risk effectively by making progress and making precautionary measures
along the way. But there is something missing (according to my point of
view).The game designer has depicted the natural disaster by showing the comets
falling and disturbing the balance. But nature is not only the cause of
disaster. We cannot blame nature for everything happening to us. Human made
disasters are also a big cause to of accidents and disturbance of balance in
nature. If I were the game designer, I would not only include the nature caused
disaster (by showing the falling comets) but also show how human made disasters
affect balance. For this purpose, I would cut short some of wealth of player if
he makes some mistakes (by placing pods on wrong place and by over-crowding).This can also be done if player makes a wrong move.In that way,the game will be best depiction of natural circumstances which will add an extra flavor to the game.
