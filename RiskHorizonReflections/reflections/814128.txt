The game is interesting. At first I failed to understand how to improve my skill. After few attempts, I started to learn the plan. The game is about creating something and then protect it with your available funds. The successful protection will help one to lessen the damage when any disaster will really arrive. At first I attempted to use two plots with the money and then protect the surrounding when the cash flow is above the requirement. The management of using the money will help to alleviate the losses in future. Now I am attempting to answer the questions.1.The role of the risk management is the successful protection of the created product.The trade-offs is the price of the product and its protection cost. If more products are made, more money would be required to protect them. So, the trade-off is to manage the product development and fiscal usage.It seems to happen immediately sometimes; otherwise they usually occur after some time.2. If I only play once, I will sure not build so many setups altogether. Because if more setups, we need more protection. But there's not enough money. So, any disaster will make one total bankrupt. I will surely try to build less setup for keeping the risk lesser.3. The game is awesome and it helps to get some idea about planning and risk management. I will make the game avatars more friendly and realistic. FAQ or how to play occasionally doesn't work. Better if we can integrate some learning environment of the game while we are making mistakes. Like the popup tips to play better.
