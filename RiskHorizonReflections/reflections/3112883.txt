                                                                              Risk Horizoh Game    This game was about effective risk management and about what kond of tools we can use in order to reduce risk and damages. I find this game very useful, because it showed me how important key components of risk - knowledge, protection, insurance, coping are.   In the game we had three main tools to use to manage risk - research, the power of protection and insurance. Research - when we notice a comet via research we were able to see the chance ot the comet hitting, and the severity of the comet. Knowing this information we could click the certain comet and elongate the time we have for community connections and thus boost our protection.Protection - In the game we had a button which we pressed to make equal comet severity and our level of protection and to protect from damage our pods. This costed us money so we were not able to press it to maximum protection.Insurance - we could use this tool to lower the costs when repairing the damaged pods. Having limited resources (money) we could not have maximum protection all the time so the knowledge and research were very important to make our decisions. Every level was more difficult than the previous one - it had more comets and we had to think and act faster. The game helped me understand the importance of every phase - before, during and after the disaster and also to realize how difficult is to observe all the time the chance of disaster and to continue developing - building and upgrading pods at the same time.
