This game could resemble our daily life. The
comets were the symbol of the resource of shocks. By doing enough research, it
is possible to gather useful knowledge and information about the specific shock
and its severity; therefore we can find the best way to confront to the shock
or obstacle. In this game has been nicely showed that, building the developed
society with enough revenue have a key role in shocks confrontation. When
enough income is available،
then the best way of protection in shape of insurance arises. The society can cope
with those shocks which can not be eliminated and cause damages with backing of insurance. So in my opinion parallel to
development of society prior any shocks happen; all the research should be done
and people should be informed accordingly. Then appropriate protection as well
as insurance should be provided.

I could play up to level 5, when I lost
the game immediately thought about the important role that financial resources
could play in society as a firm supporter. Since at the end, I didn't have
enough money neither to developed my society nor improve my insurance coverage.So if I could play the game again I try
my best to keep my financial resources as secured as possible while the severity
of future shocks is unknown. 

 

One more thing that should be considered
is having proper timing. As it is said time flies, it is not wise to Just put all your energy, money and your
time to expand one aspect of the society while neglecting other parts. Since we
don't have clear view of what the future may hold. We have no idea when and
where a shock will happen. It won't be clever if we believe that shocks or
obstacle will happen to other not to us. By having foresight we will pay enough
attention to all aspects of society. For example as society development has
been going on; secured level of financial resources considered and
simultaneously proper researches have been done which will lead to better
protection.

 

If I would be tasked with developing a new
version of the game, at the end of each level regardless the level completed or
lost; I would design a table to asses all positive and negative points of
player in different parts such as Insurance coverage, Development…. With this
information each player will have clear view about the result of his/her own effort. It is important not  going on blindly even if you win the game.
