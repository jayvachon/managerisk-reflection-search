Risk management
is the identification, assessment, and prioritization of risks followed by
coordinated and economical application of resources to minimize, monitor, and
control the probability and/or impact of unfortunate eventsor to maximize the realization
of opportunities. Risks can come from uncertainty in financial markets, threats
from project failures (at any phase in design, development, production, or
sustainment life-cycles), legal liabilities, credit risk, accidents, natural
causes and disasters as well as deliberate attack from an adversary,
or events of uncertain or unpredictable root-cause.
Several risk management standards have been developed including the Project Management Institute, the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, actuarial societies, and ISO standards

The role of risk management in the game was to control the
islands and protect the island from the comets. The main idea behind this game
was to show that disasters can happen anytime and we as people should be aware
of it and make our best to prevent ourselves and protect the environment. It is
hard to overcome a disaster, but the after effects can be controlled. 

To overcome a disaster, time and knowledge must be applied
and insurance as well.

If I had played the game more than once, I would have
upgraded my houses at the start and i would used up my insurance to recover
from the damages.
