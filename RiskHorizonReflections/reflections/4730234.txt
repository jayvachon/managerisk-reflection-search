The role of risk management in the game was to develop a community in an environment where catastrophic events (meteors here) are too frequent,
The choices that i made were according to what i had learn so far from this course, they include having insurance taken for all the time times(50% for 1st and 75% for rest of the levels) and whenever i had free time like during development of pods and fund generating (both simultaneously) i had focused on researching and protection
I would start preparing for risk management and development immediately as the game starts and i usually build 4 pods at the start of the game and build up to 7 in upcoming levels.

If i had played the game only once i had first look at all the discussions so i do get some idea beforehand and write down some (like 5 or more) strategies and choose the strongest among them and apply it in my single play.
If i had to play the game more than once i would write down many strategies and accordingly do some changes at each level  and try several strategies and then add the strategies following the 1st one to the first one, which i think would be working, some of my strategies that helped me to reach to level 4 :
Note- actually i have added the strategies following the 1st one to the 1st one  

1st strategy: Immediately as the game starts suild pods....raise protection level....until you sense a comet
2nd strategy(added with 1st): Building just 3 pods at start and concentrating on protection...raising protection very well and whenever you sense a comet coming trying to click on it(according to the time) ...waiting until research bar level rise long enough
3rd strategy(added with 1st and 2nd): Research the comet....and if the severity of the comet is higher but the speed of the comet is moderate run back to raise protection...run back again to research
4th strategy(added with 1st ,2nd and 3rd): if there are many comets to hit you simultaneously...try to share the research between them....so the community connection would not be zero for some comets  
5th strategy(added with 1st , 2nd , 3rd and 4th and also replaced some constraints) : When a comet is not coming try to use your time in raising the level of protection...also if level is about to finish....use the remaining time to raise the level....you cannot raise the level all at one...so gradually proceed.



If i was assigned to make a newer version, i would : 
replace floods with meteors (represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i live)
make the floods less frequent ( more realistic)
lower the cost of development and repairing of pods ( to 2-3% only as it would make the game of medium level and not 'extreme', lowering cost to some more amount would  make it easier on the other hand)
lower the time for raising up a level of protection (more like scenario of my area)
raise the time for research of floods ( as research takes more time in real world)

All these choices would better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i live (India)
