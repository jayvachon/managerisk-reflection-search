role of risk management in the game was clear: using the key aspects of a successful
risk project manager. These core competencies form one of the most commonly put
forward scheme to explain how an organization / a group / a group project can
be successful. For instance, the European Personnel Selection Office these eight
capabilities listed hereafter: communication, analysis and problem solving, priority
and organization, delivering quality and results, learning and development, resilience,
leadership, working with other. With at least those competencies, you are able
to evaluate the risk, prioritize your actions, and be successful. In terms of
trade-offs, my scheme was the following: build a powerful and heterogeneous network
– i.e. upgrading all hubs in order and not lvl 5 with three of them while the
rest was lvl1, build a sufficient protection – i.e. lifting the floor above the
water level enough to dodge the risk, take information upon the comets as they
arrive, NOT as they appear – i.e. as we would call it in economics “FiFo” First-in
First-out: the first that will hit should be the first analyzed. And at the
very last, if and only if everything was green, take insurance if one or many
meteors had a high chance of hitting WITH a high damage probability.2.
I played the game 3 times and stopped 2 times at the level 6 whereas I had
enough money to end the game but I ran out of time. The third time was
successful so basically I would not change a thing but if someone gives me an
interesting point of view to significantly improve my results.3.
If I had to change or add anything in that game in order to stick to reality, it
would be a random hit (maybe like from 10% to 50%) for the players who reach
easily the last step, like a flood, a drought, a power shortage… They have no
possible way to anticipate the risk and have to face it, adapt and be proactive
in solving this serious hitch.
