The role of risk management in the game was
3 fold: 1) to allow the community to learn about, and so prepare for,
approaching risks through research and so minimise the impact of risk; 2)
protection against risks through raising the ground on which the community is built
to lessen the impact of the calamity as well as making community connections
that create a safety net immediately after a calamity; 3) purchasing insurance
so that the calamity does not result in significant set backs in community
development. The game did not allow sufficient time or resources to invest in
all the 3 areas of protection, knowledge and insurance to the extent that would
fully protect the community and put them out of harm’s way, so choices had to
be made as to the beneficial affects of the different risk management
methods.  At first I invested
significantly in protection through raising the ground on which the community
was built, but this was not sufficient, I needed to have more of a balance
between the different areas and invest significantly more in research which
really sped up the pace of development and lessened the impact of the calamity.
Together with making community connections, I felt research and making community
connections had the most beneficial affects on development and risk management
as they provided communities with the tools and information to protect
themselves and bounce back from the effects of the calamity. I also always
bought the highest level of insurance whenever a particularly severe risk was
on its way, that I could not prepare for in other ways, so that I didn’t
experience significant set backs.  Preparing for risks minimized the impact of
the risk initially as well as enabling the community to recover and develop more
quickly going forward.

If I were to add something to the game it
would be to allow communities to accumulate savings that will make them more
able to bounce back from the impact of a calamity through, for example, paying
for training that might be needed to reskill if they lose a job, or have their
livelihood wiped out.
