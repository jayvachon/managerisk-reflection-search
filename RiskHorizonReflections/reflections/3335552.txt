I found the game somewhat frustrating, at maximum I got to level 2, but not beyond.1) Tradeoffs in building, upgrading, protecting, investigating, using insurance and connections to rebuild. Preparation deflected attention from building.2) I tried to build and rebuild quickly, move the protection level to match the comet and research it, if it was a major one (with high impact, especially if it had a large probability). I used insurance early in the game, not later on. Upgrades paid up, but up to a point (it was impossibly expensive to rebuild them if hit).3) I live in an advanced European country, where we do not have so many "comets", catastrofal risks. Yes, we had catastrofal floods that come reportedly 1x in 100 years already about 2x in last 10 years; so often than it seems, yet for the game the probability should be lowered.
