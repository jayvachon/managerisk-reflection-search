1) Risk management encouraged me to make intelligent choice and not rush into either blind growth or deeply conservative risk approach. My overall choice was growth with risk management and within RM, I put more impetus on research (knowledge), followed by protection and lastly insurance. In fact, I changed my strategy towards the end and de-focused on insurance while emphasising on growth, research and protection. Preparation for risk was a key influencer in how I programed my development phases and improved the quality of pods. Superior RM helped in better growth, reduced damages and overall lower RM costs as well.2) I played the game more than once. My strategy was changed from the first game towards my last as I focused on balanced development, reduced emphasis on insurance, placed more attention towards research.3) I would bring in the aspect of 'Accepting risks' as Avoidance and Transfer are well built into the game.Â
