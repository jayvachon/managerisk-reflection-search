The role of risk management is interesting. As it should be,
all action in the game cost. By building and upgrading pods, fill the development
meter for future action. I chose to build more pods. Comets act as a threat to
push you back and damaging the pods. The prediction meter predicts the chance
of the comet hitting pods. Your predictions become more accurate the longer you
observe the comet. You may be lucky and the comet miss but you have to consider
it as a threat. I did preparation immediately. The more you invest in research the
more time you have to repair the damages. Making connection adds to your
protection and you can use insurance prepares for high harmful comets. If the
pods are damages those insurance plans will cover parts of the repair costs and
replace part of your lost development.  I
chose the most cost but most covering insurance. Balancing the development with
protecting against comets is the key to access. If I did the game another time,
I think of more building and preparation for sure. And the thing that I wanted
to do differently was doing more attention and using of time more. And of course
more preparation. The main thing I learned form game is first of all being
ready for any threat is very important, prevention is better than cure. And
second, with elements like insurance, I’ve learned never ever you should say it
is late.
