Risk management is the key to the survival of
the community; you must balance between available tools to make it work, as you
can’t implement all tools at once, also you have to know that implementing the
right tool towards risk doesn’t guarantee that the problem is instantly solved,
as some tools affect the development of the community and need time to
effective. 

When there is a high chance to hit more protection is needed,
knowledge is the key to know whether you need more protection or you have to
increase the insurance in case of you can’t prevent damages, I played it
several times and in every time I discover that I only solved a part from the
problem not all of it, making balance between those tools need some experience
that you gain from your errors.  

This game adds to
you the important of risk management and the way you can use the right
preparation for the risk by gaining knowledge on the risk and further more to
seek protection with having insurance to reduce the harm of the risk and
finally by coping with the results and start redevelop your situation, nevertheless
in my opinion the game can better represent the risk management by exposing to
different kinds of risk, as the game only emphasized the risk of natural
disasters
