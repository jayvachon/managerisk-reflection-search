Effective risk management played a central role to reaching
higher level in the game.  Balancing risk
preparation, execution and healthy development  with less resources  amount to massive preparation, prioritization
and trade off. To advance to the highest level, I had to trade off high
insurance for a less costly one then concentrate on massive development and
upgrade the pods while raising my village up to avoid heavy wave impact  in order to reach the next level. Quite amount
of time was invested in researching on the comets,  centering on their severity and chances of hit.
Treats of disaster were inevitable, therefore I had to build few pods initially, then
invest in raising the village up with lower insurance coverage then later upgrade
to higher coverage once I felt most of the risks have been minimized or prepared for.

The first time I played, I spend most of my resources on
insurance and research neglecting the necessity  to raise my village up which later brought
disaster beyond my coping level. comets with high severity always brought me to
my kneel thereby preventing me from  reaching  the next level. research taught me that 95%  of comets that come at  the early stages of level 1 either missed or
have low severity level, know this gave me peace of mind to concentrate on
raising my village up. This taught me important lesson about identification of
various risks that you are exposed to, research and preparation towards
minimizing those risk. I would recommend that upgrade should include ways of generating, growing and maintaining wealth since wealth is crucial in preparing for risk and coping with a disaster as well. The level on the game should reflect the number of risk a village is exposed to with varying modes of impact. This will promote prioritization, commitment to a cause of action or inaction.
