Point 1:Role of Risk Management; I was really thinking a step forward, in terms of, do I really need to insure at this moment or to raise the height of the land. my eyes always on my development level. Risk Management emplies the most when you click on the rocks going down, its kind of risk analysis, how fast it is, how impaction, what is your insurance level and your development progress speed.Points 2:I've played the games around 4 times, the 4th time, I realized that I am going too quick to understand all the factors of risk combined, ultimately, I understand that regardless of the speed of the rock, what matter is the flood, the water, in a sense not to break my buildings and destroy my town. Having said so, I was closely monitoring the progress of development along with the height of the land. Final, I reached a perfect point of combination between the four factors: Land Height, Rocks Impact  Speed, Development Progress  Insurance.Point 3:I might allow people to use another scnarios, this case is just the sea flood which is really causing the whole catastrofy Natural Disaster of taking down the land. However, we could make the situation like an active volcano in an area which considered to be wealthy of vegetable and fruits and the farmers needs to protect their harvest by building tunnel for the lava and buying cement blocks. etc.. this will required a high attendtion on both working with a natural disaster and working with third-party suppliers
