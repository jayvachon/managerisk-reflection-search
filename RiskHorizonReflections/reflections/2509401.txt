Risk management plays an important role in the process of wealth generation and accumulation, which, in the game, reflects by the increasing green bar, money to invest and the construction of new factories. After watching the videos of week 2, i started with minimum insurance and tried to build up as fast as possible. Unfortunately, every time I got hit, it is a waste of both time and money to recover. So I changed my strategy to invest more on research.Later in the game, I am faced with the dilemma of distribution of limited resources. If I choose expensive insurance, I would end up with less money to invest on research and construction. If I spend more on construction, I am taking on more risks. This dilemma would be so realistic in any development cases. It takes time and persistent study to find the balance.If I am going to design a new version of the game, I would quantify the costs and gains. i.e. i would show in numbers, how much would you gain when upgrading each factory, how much would you lose when you gets hit by a cement of what grade, how much would it cost to study this cement, so on and so forth. These questions will increase the transparency of the game as well as players' control.
