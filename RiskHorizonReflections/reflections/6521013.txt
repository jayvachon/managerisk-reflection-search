1. From the game, it shows that risk management is a very important tool for development.In fact sustainable development is very much tied to effective risk management. The game showed taught me the following lessons:Sustainable Development cannot be achieved in the absence of protection, insurance and research. These three components integrated together are able to reduce threats arising from natural disasters. Research is particularly important because, high level of development is tied to how much research and information about impending disasters we have. I noticed from the game that i attain development faster with research and integrating other components in development. I also noticed that having development without adequate insurance poses a great risk when natural disaster  strikes. Usually much financial resources is involved from the loss of physical capital.2. I played the game severally without crossing the level 2 point. They rate at which the diseasters occurred were such in a high speed. If i played again, i will not concentrate more on physical asset development, but will effectively combine research, protection and moderate insurance cover to attain significant development. I think  I focused more on physical assets accumulation and protection and less of research and insurance.3. I will focus more on research innovation because with adequate information about impending disasters, come better and innovative approaches to physical asset development. Advocacy should immediately   follow as I need to communicate research findings to communities to be better informed before disaster happens. In this way, loss  of both human and physical capital will be minimized.
