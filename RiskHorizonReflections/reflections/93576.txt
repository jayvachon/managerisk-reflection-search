The role of risk
management in the game Risk Horizon was to minimize the impact of the oncoming
meteors.  Several options were available,
including purchasing insurance, researching and raising the level of your city.  Each of these approaches were available in
different quantities, and there is a need to balance each approach or they are
disproportionately expensive.  For
example, insurance requires an upfront payment which hinders your ability to
upgrade your city for greater production. 
Raising your city also has problems if done excessively, it is very
expensive to raise the level very high in comparison to the damage wrought by
the far and few meteors that may get past a regularly raised city.

I played the game
twice.  The first time, I was under the
impression that insurance would damage my production too severely and
underestimated what a significant discount repairing would be if insurance was
bought.  As a result I only upgraded
production and raised the level of my city in an attempt to avoid all incoming
meteors.  I was more successful when I
balanced the raising of the city with the insurance.  I raised the city to roughly 5 or 6 bars and
any impact that was higher would simply have the damage repaired.  I purchased either the 33% or 50% insurance
only.  As a result, I approached this
with the equimarginal principle in mind, to reduce damage by approaching it in
different ways.

If I were asked to
improve this game, I believe that the “coping” or repair mechanism could be
elaborated.  I questioned whether I should
repair a building when another comet was to strike soon and decided against
it.  I think there may be a good argument
for people who would partially repair, knowing well that another disaster will
strike soon, just to return to some form of production without the expense of
entirely repairing a building.
