Game Reflection according to the questions followed as a guide and the conclusions i gathered after i played Risk Horizon: Risk Management in the game has the role to balance research, protection, insurance and community development. Community connections are a type of insurance. When disaster strikes we help each other survive by sharing resources. Forming and sustaining connections is so valuable.Preparation to Risk Management has to occur the sooner the better.RESEARCHBefore a disaster, we should not worry to do community connections, but instead try spending more time on research, especially for more severe shocks, in this case, comets.The more research, the more time we will have to prepare!Even the information we have about shocks is not perfect, the more we research them, the  more accurate our information becomes. That ´s why severity and chance of hit change as we spend more time on research.PROTECTIONRegarding protection, even a little bit of it goes a long way. Even if the pods are damaged, they will be damaged less if we are protected. This make them easier to repare.Conclusion: the role of Risk Management is to mitigate the losses ( in this case) and improve the benefits that people experience when they face risk ( in this case) and opportunity.The perceived benefit of Risk Management depends on assessment of the likely size of a future shock, the probabiliy of it occurring, and how much people care about the future ( when the benefits of Risk Management would accrue) compared with the present. (when the costs are undertaken).If i played the game only once, i would try from the beginning to dedicate more time in building more pods and upgrade them, and more time in research. If i played the game more than once, after the first time i would try to enhance protection for not being destroyed  so easily and enhace also by these means, community development..I learned from the game the importance of a right balance between: knowledge, protection, insurance, community development, and this is exactly what we are trying to learn when we talk about an effective Risk Management.To better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place i live, I would propose to change the comets for economics measures coming from the government. It was a very interesting way to learn!Thank you!Cecilia Costa Vilar
