GAME REFLEXION

The role
of risk management in the game:

The risk
management role was of improving the performance by mitigating shocks and
unwelcome surprises; and implying control of possible future events, reducing
the magnitude of shocks’ impact as well. The risk management also allocated the
risks in this game.

Trade-offs
I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance and choices made:

Knowledge 

On knowledge,
I didn’t understand shocks and the potential effect to ensure protection.

Protection


The
challenges I confronted are that I didn’t knew that however the protection is,
to ensure a lot is also important because it makes an easier reconstruction if
damages occurred.

Insurance


I knew
that insurance is for overtime and I didn’t do it to ensure the resources
transfer intending effective resilience.

Ways the
preparation for risk affect development

As
preparation, knowledge-protection and insurance constitute pre-risk management
activities; it implies right, specific and certain strategic risk management
plan and ensure right and appropriate immediate defense/action to manage shocks
and preserve to overcome its impact.

This
will ensure sustainable and or guaranteed development plan

The
thing I did differently is to not repeating the mistakes I made before

And as I
played the game more than once, after the first game I tried to meet the gap
and instaure guaranteed protective and insurance measures.

The main
things I learned are: 

·        
Risk
management awareness and learning from the past; 

·        
Early
and real time to insure /to render the risk management effective;

·        
Event
impacts mitigation through protective measures.

Proposal
to better risk management choice

For a
better representation of the risk management choices, in my place, I can propose
to add to the game, a risk-assessment tool for risk assessment probability and
severity, to ensure the appropriate risk management choice in matter of
choosing insurance and building a fitting protection towards the shocks.
