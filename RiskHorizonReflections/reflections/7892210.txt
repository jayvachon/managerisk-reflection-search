1) Role of risk management in the game was to ensure maximum development of the community while effectively monitoring the impacts of shocks by developing / updating a real time strategy. I devised a strategy where a mix of knowledge (research) and protection was employed heavily with low concentration on insurance to go with steady development. Reason being a calamity like shocks may drastically impact the whole community and insurance may not be a suitable risk mitigation option in the circumstances.Â Risk preparation may negatively affect the development in short term as resources would be utilized in risk preparation but in the long run it will have positive impacts on the development.2) At first I played with the strategy where a risk preparation mix of all the powers was used at a maximum achievable level causing unacceptable development. Therefore, I changed the strategy to manage development alongside risk preparation and prioritizing risks. Certain risks are inherent and hence unavoidable therefore risk preparation should be done. However, absolute risk preparation for every risk at utmost level is also not the best of the options as funds are scarce. Effective management of risk is essential to the development and is achieved by preparing for risks in advance.3) I work in Afghanistan so security is a big concern for development so I would add security risk in the game.
