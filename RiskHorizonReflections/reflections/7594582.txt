REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME

 

The Role of risk Management in the game
was to tackle the likelihood of shocks happening and their impacts. Thus to
combine the capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards

 

The choice of taking on risk and preparing
for it was appropriate because the benefits of paying in advance for
preparation exceeds the cost of paying for the damage afterwards. Indeed developing
and implementing risk management plan is cost effective.

 

Since the goal risk management is to
mitigate the losses and improve the benefits that people experience when they
face risk and opportunity one cannot compromise on the combination of these
three actions: acquiring Knowledge,
obtaining protection and obtaining insurance. However protection and insurance
may create synergies or require trade-offs.

 

The quality of information with less ambiguity
leads to investment in early warning indicators and contingency planning to
improve emergency response which in turn complements insurance which serves as
a shock absorber.

 

Preparation for risk affects development
in the following ways

Better knowledge inform decisions about investments in
     skills and educationLong term forecastingImprove productivityImprove investmentIntroduction of new technologies Resilience to shocksSaves livesQuick recovery 

Thus with good preparation, only minimal
coping may be needed to recover quickly leaving more resources available for
investment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks.

 

In the subsequent attempts, the following
were considered

Effective planImplement the plan by embracing
     thinking and adopting a new way of workingLessons learnt upon reflective practice includes

Risk is inevitable in

The change I recommend is indicators for
risk in public place.
