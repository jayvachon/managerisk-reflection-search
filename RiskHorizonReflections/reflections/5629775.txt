In the game, you have to use risk management to choose where the limited resources will be aplied, knowing that the place is kind to a regular natural disaster (comets). You can choose investing in developing your land, which will give you more resources over time, buying protection to reduce damage, insurance or studying the comets. Geting knowledge about the comets was crucial for 2 reasons: knowing how much protection was needed and having more time to cope after strikes.Prepation for risk affects development in two moments: firstly, immediately, because as resources are rare, you have to spend money you could have used for more upgrades (development), and second, after some time, when the risk stops being a just a risk and you have to cope afterwards (the better you prepared first, the less development will be lost or less resources will be need to fix things). A successful risk management in this game was knowing how to balance those two moments.The first few times I played, I used to buy too much protection and insurances and didn't get enought development, so after a few tries, I started using better the information from the comets and focus more on developing the land and using the "free time" to get knowledge, upgrading protection when necessary, or geting insurance when the risk was too high. One of the most important things I learned was that we can't stop development because of the fear of risk.To improve the game, I would suggest to allow multitasking, because in real life some risk managers can get information and get protection at the same time.
