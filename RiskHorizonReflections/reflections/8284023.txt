The game was quite interesting but the technical glitches were very troublesome. However, I felt that the concepts of insurance, protection and knowledge were very well embedded in the game, making it an enjoyable learning experience. The potential risk of flooding of the pods had to be managed in terms of preparing for them by obtaining protection and carrying out research and thereafter, coping with the damage with the power of inssurance. Matching the protection bars with the severity of the comets raised the land preventing damage to the pods and the accumulated research strengthen our protection by enabling us to create connections before the hitiing of the comet. Insurance was handy after the pods were damaged since they could be rebuilt cheaper and the develoment time lost could be recovered. The trade-offs were crucial because the available resources were limited and had to be allocated appropriately. I felt that effective allocation of resources was the key to creating a healthy community. Investing in only one tool would hinder development and pose a constraint to hollistic growth. Thus, preparing for the risk in advance affects development both immediately and after some time. I played the game more than once and in doing so I changed my strategy. Initially, I adopted the strategy of building only 2-3 pods and focussed on upgrading them. I started to build the other pods when the development bar was no longer green. I realised after reaching the 4th level that this no longer worked. I then changed my strategy. I focussed on building and upgrading all the the pods altogether and noticed that the resources flowed in more quickly due to the increase in the rate of development. This enabled me to continue developing the community whilst protecting and insuring it. This broadened my understanding of how crucial it is for the community to grow as a whole simultaneously with the concerted efforts of all concerned.If I am tasked with developing a new version of the game, I woud propose to incorporate the possibility of the unwillingness of certain persons to invest in the preparation of the risk. Sometimes, only a few people pay heed to the risk managment choices as the others feel that its not their responsibility. India being a developing country has a large population, of which many are economically backward and many are unaware of the importance of risk preparation and hence, do not consider risk managemnt as one of their priorities. This is because food, water and electricity are placed at the top of their list and little else matters to them.
