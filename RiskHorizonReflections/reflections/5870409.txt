The role of risk management was to protect the community from comets hitting our world and causing damage. There were three ways to achieve this, by researching the comets, protection from the comet impact, and insurance. I left protection to the last, every time I tried making that a priority over research I ended up losing the game. My first priority was insurance, second was research followed by protection. Every time I made protection a priority my development was affected immediately. But the further I got along in the game, the lack of protection hampered my development even more. I learned that you can't spend all your money on development. You have to save some for the after effects of the comet. If I were to play again for the first time I would definitely buy the highest insurance first, not the lowest. I would change the initial building of new developments. You would have two options first standard home, the second re-enforced homes that receives less damage but cost double the price. You would have to trade off more expensive development initially for savings later.What would I change to represent risk management choices where I live is a tough question. I currently live in Denmark, but I am from Detroit. In Denmark the worst disasters are typically flooding or loss of employment. Both are well represented with risk management choice in the game, but if I were to use Detroit as a reference I would have to add a "police enforcement" option. An excessive amount of looting/riots happens after a disaster, and you need some type of law enforcement to keep the peace, so to speak. I would add training and employing police option each level like the insurance.
