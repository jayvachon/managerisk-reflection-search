1. The role of the game was the development of the community of pods, and making choices with limited resources of how to defend the pods from the danger of crashing comets. It was difficult at first to recognize what defenses worked best against different types of comets with different risks of impact. In particular, I believe that I spent too much of my resources purchasing insurance, and not enough time doing research on the comets. When I adjusted my strategy later in the game, my results were better.2. I spent a lot more time doing research the second time I played. I didn't realize at first the impact that it had on mitigating the effects of the comets.3. I would add the opportunity to add other mitigation features to individual pods that have more importance, and that require bigger investments. So for example, it might be possible to completely insure a level 4 pod, or perhaps build a specific fence or mitigation feature for that pod.
