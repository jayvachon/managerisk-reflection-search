Role of risk management in the game was highly
important as one has to build the pods and simultaneously keep a look over the
comets which is going to strike and cause damage to it. The first choice I made
while building the pods was that I tried to build it far from the sea as the
severity of the comets can cause more destruction to the pods and hence it will
cost more to rebuild as the damage is bound to increase. I tried to study the
comets severity by going through its research and chances of hit, but many a
times research showed wrong data  chances of hit were more accurate, I
chose the Insurance plan according to the severity of the comet i.e. higher the
severity higher the % of plans cost. I have played the game more than once so
while the first time I played it I bought the insurance when I saw that the
research is showing chances of comets hitting the pods, but it didn’t hit else
missed the pods. So the second time I didn’t trusted the research data rather I
stick more on chances of hit data. I tried to build more of a pods in the first
due to which my losses were higher and second time I played I tried to build
pods keeping in context the money and losses if comets hit. The thing which I
will add in the game is that showing in % terms where the research data is
correct on estimating the hits made by comet.

The change which I would propose so as to better
represent the risk management choices is in terms of universalization of health
insurance as I am living in India where health costs for an individual is very
high and for the poor it is almost impossible to have insurance, so  kind of system needs to be created where the
costs of health insurance is borne by each and every individual where every
person contributes some amount to the government exchequer so that a corpus
fund is created to fight out the burdens which arises due to the high health
costs. Simultaneously there has to be strengthening of Public  Health systems so as to make more effective
use of the health resources which we are having in India rather than let the
resources be kept idle. If these aspects are taken into account then the rate
of poverty is also bound to decrease as it is estimated that every year due to
expensive health costs 1 million people in India fell below poverty line else
gets trapped into vicious cycle of poverty.
