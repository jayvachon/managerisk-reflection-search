The game took a bit to understand.  Insurance was self explanatory, as was building and upgrading structures.  The metorites were the only threat to worry about as far as I could tell.  And I am not sure what elevating your community is analagous to in real life, besides just a general risk mitigation tool.  I discovered the only way to make money is to build and upgrade structures as fast as possible.  In the beginning this was easy and cheap.  Insurance wasn't a real worry.  And my only mitigation was elevating my community.  As my community became more expensive, i.e. upgraded, I found insurance to asl increase in price, but also the coverage increased.  Meaning when my buildings started to cost over $500 to upgrade, the $135 insurance for 50% coverage for my community was worth it.  However, I never used my insurance, so in those terms it was a waste of money.  I never determined the point of research.  It didn't seem to save me any money or prepare me any better.  It actually began to waste my time I could have been using to build or prepare in other more applied mannors.  If I was to develop a new version of the game, I would explain more or make a differentiation between where you build your community structures in terms of economics.  One would think it would be more economical to have development near water than inland, however with tsumani risk from metorites, the risk of shore line building would also be higher.  I would also introduce another threat.   Applying this game to my community is an interesting application.  I live in South Florida, and flooding risk is quite high.  We are used to getting hurricanes, so are prepared for the wind.  But the storm surge that comes with them is hard to prepare for when the land is just about at sealevel.  Some homes prepare by building up on stilts.  We also have installed breakwaters, and are starting to restore mangrove islands which not only take the wave action, but also absorb some of the storm surge.  Insurance is difficult here.  We are actually forced to have home owners insurance if you have a morrgage on your home, which in my opinion is a champion of insurance lobbists and a failure on the side of the citizen.  I know every few people that have claimed any value remotely close to the astronomical fees they pay in insurance, and this is after living through two major hurricanes that centered right over my town.
