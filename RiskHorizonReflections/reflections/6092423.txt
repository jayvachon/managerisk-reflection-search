Risk-management’s role was to prepare, protect, and cope
with the aftermaths of known impending shocks (comets) as a planet was
developing. Risk management was made possible through a combination of the
powers of research, insurance, and protection. Trade-offs came between the
speed of development and the budgetary restrictions and the timing of using the risk-management powers with the timing of the comet hits. These, in my opinion, all seem based on impending
foreseen disasters. While it took money and time to focus and prepare for
disasters, this slowed the process of development greatly.

I played three rounds of the game before I realized that once it was finished, it was finished. I expected each level to end much like a traditional video game, graduating me to the next. I was quite wrong. In all three episodes, I tried to build a few pods before purchasing insurance
and or using protection as I intermittently researched the pods. As I played
more than once, I became more focused on protections and insurance, which
depleted my resources quickly and impeded development of the colony. However, the
trade-off was that I was able to not sustain any damage in the community when
comets did hit. In the final round, having been conditioned to fear the impending shocks, I built one pod and immediately built up protection and bought the highest level insurance. This depleted my resources to the point that I could no longer build until quite later in the game. Needless to say, my third round was my least successful. I may return to simply do the opposite~ focus on building 100%, to see what the other side of the spectrum may yield in terms of "level achieved."

I learned about myself in that I was quite focused more on
impending shocks than I was in development. I can imagine that there are a good
number of individuals on the opposite side of the spectrum. Because I was more
focused on preparing for the shocks, this slowed development and I was unable
to advance passed level 2. It gives me greater understanding and leads me to be more willing to take a less than 100% protection road for the sake of development. What can be concluded is that Success (to level 5, as designed by the course and game makers)
would mean that the rate of development must be better balanced by being
willing to take more risks. In other words, for the larger picture of development to be successful, communities must be open and willing to sustain partial damage (lower insurance
protection), and focus greater resources on development rather than simply protection. It helps explain how countries that have thrown full force into building (Korea, for instance) instead of risk management have developed so quickly despite its disasters. It also can help explain their (over) confidence in their methods based on their overwhelming success and co-morbid reticence to put resources towards risk management, since they've succeeded without much of this. (This with the exception of the efforts made/being made the armistice with North Korea.) 

The only thing I would change is to put a resistance element
into the game, be it politics, another reason for resource drain that are
unexpected and not explained before the game begins. This would add an element of reality into the game.Addendum: I used my own reflection to redo the game till I won passed level 5. So the moral of the story is: no insurance until your done developing? focus more on research and other protection? I hear you loud and clear.
