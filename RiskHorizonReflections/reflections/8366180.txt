My reflections on the Risk Horizon game have three parts.First I will try give ansver what was the role of risk managment and what choices did I have to do.Secondary I will say what I will do difrent if I play the RIsk Horizont again,and what I learned from the game.In thrdl part I will propose some change that would better represent the risk management in Croatia.Finnaly I will gave my opinion on the game.The risk managment have big impact in this game,because we had decide what to do whit our investition,we must decide will we protect our investition or not and if we will protect we must decide how to do protection.We have trade-offs between investition,protection and insurance.I decide invest in investition and insurance,but not in protection and that is one of the reasons why I come only to the fourth level.Preparation for risk slowing growth in short term,but have positive effect in the lon run. If I play the Risk Horizont again I will invest more budegt and time in protection because if I have good protection then I can invest less in influence and more in productivity.If someone ask me about the main things that I learned from the game I will always say the main thing is that I now think much more about risks and what is the right combination of protection and insurance of investition.Because in some situation is better protect investiton but in some other situation is better pay insurance because protection is too expensive.I am from Croatia,small country in Europe.Croatia had big problem with huge plans.For this reason and because of the slow public administration many investments fail.Because of these two reasons,I would in a game introducet restrictions that each center can not prosper equually effective or to say this on other words some centers will developted slowly than others.Secondary I will upgraded game with licence that also depent on the center,the center that are slowy developted are faster with licence.In conclusion I will gave my personal opinion of the Risk Horizont game.The game is very simple and my first opinion was:"Why we need play this silly game?" But when I start game and pass first level,in this level I have a lot of luck, I started think about many combination that we have in game and we must decied what is a real combination for us.Now when I think about game I thought that is great game because in simple way show what isÂ  risk management.
