The role of risk management was to hinder catastrophic losses due to comets' impacts while avoiding slowing down too much the development of the various pods.I tried to implement a balanced approach, both in developing pods in number and size and in ensuring adequate risk coverage via knowledge, protection and insurance. Generally I started with pods' development and then moved to research comets: until when impact probability was lower than 40% and effect of impact was lower than 30% I kept on focusing on development alone. As soon as these thresholds were passed, I purchased a 75% insurance and, if the effect of impact was greater than 50% I started raising the island while keeping an eye on remaining time and development goal.I played the game 6 times and I tried various approaches: developing and increasing in size just a couple of pods, creating all possible pods and maintaining them at the same level, using no insurance, no research and no protection. The main lesson learnt I got is that no extreme approach works on the long term and mistakes done early on are difficult to recover. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, "in media res stat virtus": risk management is a balancing act that needs to be put into practice early on and constantly taken care of.As possible additional future for the game, I would suggest including various pods: internationalization and multicultural environments are more and more present in today society and creating various pod types with different properties and features could well represent the current situation experienced daily in the workplace.
