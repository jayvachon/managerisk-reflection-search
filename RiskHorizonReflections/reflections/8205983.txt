The Risk Horizon game served to practically demonstrate the concepts of risk, knowledge, protection and insurance. 

Question 1:
One topic that stood out to me was trade-offs. In economics, we learn of “opportunity cost”- which is the loss incurred when you chose one priority over another. If you over-spend on insurance or protection, the opportunity cost is having less cash, thus less development in your civilization. The Risk Horizon game demonstrated that time and money are finite resources, and that in order to build a healthy, productive civilization, effective risk management is critical. A good risk-manager realizes that these precious resources (time, money, protection, etc.) need to be budgeted and planned considerably, despite the random nature of disasters.
Knowledge was the best defense in the simulation. By analyzing when the disasters would occur, I could effectively plan when to prioritize building over protection, resulting in timely growth and risk mitigation. This way, development occurred whenever danger was not imminent, and protection was built just before disaster. This rings true in the real world: we have sufficient technology to predict which areas are more likely to be struck by specific disasters (whether natural or economical), and we can effectively plan how to budget our resources to prosper around disasters, without the fear of devastating losses. 
My strategy in the game was to start by investing in a mid-range insurance policy. The insurance programs lasted the entire level, so the sooner they could be applied, the better. This saved recovery costs down the line. Protection (by raising the land above sea level) stalled the society’s development, so I had to use it very cautiously. With that in mind, I only protected my civilization immediately before an asteroid stuck, which allowed me to develop throughout the game, but still lessen the consequences of disasters as they struck. 
I also enjoyed the analogy for sharing the burden of risks- connecting the buildings just as disaster was striking. By distributing this burden between members of a community, individuals are far more resilient to disaster. Essentially, this shared-burden-of-risk simulates a small-scale insurance scheme, without major administration. 

Question 2: 
The first time I played the game, I lost miserably– during the first level! My mistake was being too cautious- I wasted valuable resources on high-level insurance, which did not pay off in the long run. I had over-insured the civilization, and when disaster struck, the insurance was good, but by the end of the level, I did not have a large enough civilization. The second time I played, I was successful, in that I took risks that yielded high returns. I safeguarded myself with some well-timed insurance and protection, but I did not over-insure. 
I learned that the same logic applies in real life. If we are to prosper, taking risks–and bearing the consequences–is an essential part of society. By safeguarding ourselves to a reasonable extent, we can aim higher, and fall softer. We will never be productive without taking some risks; the key is to hedge against your risks and put into place coping mechanisms for dealing with the consequences of disaster. 

Question 3:
If I could add one thing to the game, it would be random disasters. Sometimes, a civilization has no way of predicting the type of disaster, or the scale (for instance, the 2008 great recession). The consequences can be devastating, but quick and effective responses to such disasters can help the society land on its feet. The game gave me great practical insight to what it means to be an effective risk-manager.
