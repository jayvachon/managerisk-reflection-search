In this game, one never knows when a comet will appear, how many comets will appear and which one will hit. Risk management was important in the sense that it helps one to develop the city at a steady pace whilst withstanding hits with limited resources.In playing the game, I started development at a slow pace up to a point before protecting the development, purchasing insurance and researching on the comet. I then left sufficient funds to repair damages made after a comet hit.The trade off was made between pursuing new development and reserving resources to rebuild in case of a hit.If I played the game once, I would have built a little more faster than before and used more protection so that when the comet hits the damage will me minimal.Â The valuable lesson learnt from this game is that for every development activity that is undertaken, it is imperative to put mitigation measures in place against adverse risks that may occur. On the other hand if one is too cautious, development may be slowed down. One must develop resilience but must also push forward to make good use of opportunities.The game can be improved by giving people a wider range of options to chose from to mitigate the risk such as different types of protection and different types of knowledge gained (research)
