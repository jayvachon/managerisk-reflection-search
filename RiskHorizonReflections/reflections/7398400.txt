The role of risk management in this game was to help mitigate risks and provide opportunities for development. The way I happened to play the game was to spend most of the resources on insurance and the development of pods. The reason behind this was to advance the cause of development in order to reach the goals. I used whatever money remained was used for last minute protection, as any very strong comets arrived. The immediate impacts of preparation for risk were to slow down development due to a lack of resources; on the other hand, preparation for risk in the long run actually improved development because fewer resources were used to fix damaged pods, thus speeding up development. The first time I played the game was a bit of a disaster; I was not aware of how to develop the pods. After going over the instructions, I was able to work on developing the pods, I also made sure to have a good balance of insurance and protection. I think I ought to have used research more. I learned about the balance required in risk management between insurance, protection, and research in order to mitigate risks as much as possible; I also learned how effective risk management could help promote development. The final thing I learned dealt specifically with protection, and how protection in certain circumstances could actually slow growth; this, I believe, was specifically referring to environmental protection, and how in the short term it can hamper growth and development. If I were to make an addition to the game, I would have liked to include an aspect of private enterprise. As someone from the United States, private enterprise plays a key role in certain aspects of risk management. I would like to see how private enterprises could aid in development by building pods of their own, and I would like to see how private enterprise can actually cause problems when it comes to risk management due to misallocation of resources and the withholding of information.
