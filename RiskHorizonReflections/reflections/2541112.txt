As a risk manager in this beautiful fantasy world I managed to get through the severe rain of meteorites! Citizens are safe and no dammage has occured. As the possibility to obtain reliable knowledge about the exact severity of the meteorites was limited, i have trusted mainly on creating protection. All the time I increased the protection to the second-highest protection level - not the highest as the cost benefit analysis indicated that such events are very unlikely. As my first line of defence was so well I was able to refrain from investing in insurance investments. In order to obtain sufficient funds I have both build new houses and upgraded existing once as soon as possible. If I would play the game again I would allow a somewhat lower level of direct protection. This would create additional funds that I could invest in (productive) housing. Potentially I would buy insurance too, even though it was hard to estimate the necessity of this.To provide better risk management in my daily (financial service industry) life it seems especially necessary to overcome the behavioral shortcoming: people tend to be overconfident and have short memory: as it turns out all the time: this time is NOT different....
