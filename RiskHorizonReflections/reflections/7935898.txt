The
game consists on building a village, in order to achieve it, it is necessary to
build new structures, however, some comets hit the village and destroy these
buildings. The role of risk management is very important because it helps to
minimize the damage, and in some cases even to prevent this damage. It is also
important because one strategy of risk management is to get insurances that
protect your buildings and in the case that the comet hits you, you would not
have to pay for all the damages. The game allows you to make some research;
this research is fundamental to make some choices. When you research you can
know the severity and the probability that the comet has of hitting your
villages, with this information you can decide to invest more time doing some
research that allows you to minimize the damages, you can also decide if it is
worth it to pay the insurance, the insurance is expensive, and there are 3
types of insurance, the one that gives you a protection of 33%, one of 50% and
one of 75% of protection, as the insurance covers more it is more expensive, so
when you invest in the research, you can decide which insurance is more
convenient. 

 

I
played the game twice, the first time I played I was not very successful,
because I did not want to risk a lot and I did not build enough building and I
did not a lot of research, however, the second time I played I tried to do more
research and only purchase the insurance if there was high risk from the comet
to hit the village, and also I took into account the severity of the cometh to
decide which insurance was more convenient. If the risk was high but the
severity was low I just purchased the insurance that cover 33% and if the
severity was high I invested more money and purchased the insurance that covered
75% and even if it was much more expensive if I got hit, the fee for the
reconstruction of the building was affordable. One of the main things that I learned
from the game is that sometimes is better to risk some money when you did some
previous research and found out that the risk of losing it are lower than the
chances of getting some profit or goos results form than risk, it is also important
to consider getting an insurance and decide the cover of it in accordance of
the risk we are on.
