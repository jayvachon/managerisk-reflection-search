The game illustrated main
principals of risk-management, usage of different kind of tools and methods,
various choices and compromises which have to be made. The first point I would
like to outline is that coping with consequences of adverse events is much
easier when certain precautions are made. It may sound quite obvious, however,
it is necessary to understand that even in case of inevitable risks some measures
can be very helpful. So, what were the tools shown in the game?

The most effective measure (as I discovered it during number of games) was to
ensure long-term protection from meteorites by building higher level of the
"city's" basement. The drawback of it, however, is a necessity of
wide range of factors, which include (1) time, (2) information, (3) resourses.
Firstly, "time" means that while preventing damage from risky events
(which, after all, even may not occur) people can not develop their
"city". The time factor is the more important the closer this event
is. As well as the closer the end of the level is approaching. Secondly, to
provide appropriate protection we need information about severity of the
upcoming event, its possibility, etc. Otherwise, both time and resourses would
be wasted without any usefulness. The more information about the event is
provided the easier it would be to cope with consequences and the more
effective undertaken measures would be. Finally, resourse is a significant
factor. This may include money (in the game), as well as natural, physical or
human resourses. As in case of time, spending resourses on preventing damage
means that other projects (building and developing houses) should be postponed
or decreased.

Another way to make it easier to
cope with problems is to pay insurance before the risks are undertaken.
However, sometimes it make people more irresponsible, because the insurance
company would pay part (or most) of the reconstruction, which means that the
community will pay. This game doesn't not show this drawback. We might consider
that it does effect on our choice of effective risk-management. Thus, it would be better to implement some conditions for those who use insurance: for instance, they should reach some level of protection or spend at least 3-5 stages of exploration the meteorites. The
game provide three options of insurance, that is why during the game we should also take into account is
usefulness together with other tools. For example, at lower levels, when meteorites
are not very severe it would be better to prevent damage at all by building
long-term protection. Thus, we are both capable of providing such protection
(of 3 or 4 levels) and save money with buying low-cost insurance. At higher
level, basement construction is much more expensive, so insurance would be
worth it and reduce costs (by the way, at higher level development of the
"city" leads to more expenditures on reconstruction).

Risk-management is compromising
between different ways to prevent, mitigate and cope with events, considering
existing conditions, aims and available resourses.
