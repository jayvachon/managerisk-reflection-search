     In the game, the role
of risk management was to demonstrate how risk management operates in the risk chain.
The player had to prepare and cope with shocks to their community and cope.  To do this, the Luminator had to decide what to
balance preparation for the potential shock of a comet strike and ensuing
tsunami with development of the community of Alora. Preparations for Alora included
researching comets (knowledge), purchasing insurance, or raising the elevation
of the community (protection). The better the preparation directly correlated
with how well you would be able to cope with a comet strike and continue
growing.

     Every choice had different results on Alora’s development.
Research cost money, but impact on development didn’t help until the community
network was mobilized after the comet strike. Insurance was costly and show
results unless the community suffered damage, but then the speed and cost of
replacement was based on the amount purchased. Finally, the option I relied on
most, was raising the elevation of the community. I found that raising the
community to an appropriate height provide the best protection most of the time.
However, this was enhanced by having minimal insurance and decent money reserves
to prevent absolute destruction.

     While I made it
to level six my first try, and lost, I still tried several different scenarios.
 First I balancing everything to almost
exacting standards, which required a lot of monitoring and quick movements
post-shocks. To see if that was the best method I tried other development
strategies, tis included buying maximum insurance, building the community
slowly in waves or all at once, and raising the community to the safest point. Focusing
everything on one aspect was never as successful as the first attempt. I
learned that it is very difficult to get everything perfectly balanced, and as
the reading mentioned, you can’t expect to protect from all shocks.

     A change that I
would make to the game would be to add a meter that tracks the population’s
satisfaction with the Luminator. During the game one of the comments between
levels was that the citizens of Alora enjoyed seeing constant construction. I
believe this satisfaction meter would simulate the political considerations a
politician must face from their constituency when wanting to stay in office and
could likely affect decisions the Luniminator would make take in order to keep
the population appeased, a reality faced by governments making risk management
decisions.
