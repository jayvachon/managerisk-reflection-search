The game covered all the basis of risk management: reserch (expressed by a value proportional to the time invested into observing the comets), Protection (exponentially linked to the resources invested into building infrastructures) territory development and insurance.In the begining I thought that, since this was going to be a game about "beating th risks", it could have been a good idea to massively invest into protection and achive a top level of cover against any kind of disaster: the results where far from beeing acceptable, since the ammount of resurces drained by my cospicuous investment into protection quickly sunk the economy of my colony. The lesson was learned: you can (and have) to achieve an high standard of avarage protection without pretending to cover the risk of even the most severe events... not only it would be costly  but in the end you will run out of the resurces needed to shelter yourself, insure, or even repair the damages you are going to suffer late or soon. In the subsequent games I tried to balance the investments into protection by accepting that in no case I would be able to be sheltered against the most severe meteor strikes: i did this by spending more time observing the meteors and deciding wich kind of insurence was appropriate to cover the risk of an event that I could never be ready for in term of protection. Research played thus an important role in the choice of which tool to choose in order to cover specifics risks and sistemic overwelming risks: the large amount of resources saved in this way was then free for me to invest into the economic and social development of the colony, which eventually generated a larger amount of cash-flow at my disposal to invest in higher standard of protection and insurance.In developing a new game I would treat more in deep the kind of protection at your disposa to choose in order to prevent risk (soft and cheper vs hig cost)
