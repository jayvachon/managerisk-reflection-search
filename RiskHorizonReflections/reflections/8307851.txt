Reflections
about the Game

Risk management has a very crucial role in this game.  It was a challenging
experience to learn how risk management is important for one’s healthy development
through this game. This tutorial have helped to learn about the game more in detail.The task of developing this community by
meeting certain milestones being the luminator of Alora in the ways was really hard.We certainly need to ensure adequate measures like sufficient cash is there with us before considering building the pods.The important point to be considered while the game is to balance risk with development,and the risk protection was limited.It was certainly necessary to balance between growing the community and preparing for the potential shocks as Alora falls victim to falling comets,these comets careen into water and causes waves that hinder development.The power to
look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time
until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the different
scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it.75% of the risk we could minimize the chance of being hit by undertaking insurance protection .With this the cost of repairing the damaged pods could be reduced.Before considering these decisions we certainly have to
consider the resources as its availability is limited. It certainly need to
be put into best possible usage.It would be difficult for a person who is playing for the first to access the risk involved and the possible consequences by the unforeseen factors.But if a chance is given to play again then the person will certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting attacks of damaged based on previous experience.

The important lesson learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different risk
situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about different
ways to manage risk etc.

If given a chance to develop a new
version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups within
the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each members with
the group financially in times of need. They could also take up a group
insurance policy to anticipate and manage their risk. They could discuss within
the groups their past experiences of risk and share within their group .
