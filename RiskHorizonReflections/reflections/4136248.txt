1. In this game, the risk management was reflected in terms of raising the protection and recovering the damage once the comet is hitting the planet. In addition, there's option to purchase the insurance to decrease the damage once the planet is hit. Also, doing more research can help you predict the severity of the hit and chance of hit more precisely and in that way can help you protect your pods in a better way.The choice I make is to create multiple pods, and upgrade them when the capital is enough. Also, the trade-off will be spending the time doing the research and developing the pod. And the insurance will cost term amount of capital, and it's also a trade off.Preparation for the risk can to some degree increase the recovery once the comet has hit the planet.2. I played multiple times, and the difference was to change the sequence of doing the development of pod and doing the research. I think, the strategy is very important during the game.3. I would say, I'd like to have more option to control the damage once the comet has hit the planet. And may be there could be more options for insurance.
