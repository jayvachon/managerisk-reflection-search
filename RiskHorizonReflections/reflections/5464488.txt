In the beginning I thought that this game was very easy after I did the tutorial, but when I understood its complexity when reaching higher levels, I understood that the role is to create and improve as well as protect in order to be rewarded with more resources. In the beginning it was quite easy, I thought, by buying insurance, I did not need to do any research and continue on developing and upgrading as fast as possible, but I also realised that did not keep my meter reaching the target levels to continue in the game. I realised that for each level, there was a requirement to balance the resources given along with protection needed and insurance. I also realised that buying more protection or developing the pods too quickly also did not fill my meter quick enough. After I failed the first time, I started the game by buying insurance and protecting the land at least to 4 bars as minimum, I realised it is better to start with ensuring safety then continue to build and develop the pods. If I had the opportunity to change or add something to the game, I would add that as we increase our levels, to buy research bars for comets that pass quickly by. Or even be able to keep the level of protection once we manage to link the communities and reach a higher level than the required damage level.
