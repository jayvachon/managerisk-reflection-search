I believe that the purpose of this game was to show the need for proper balancing between cost and effectiveness of development and on the other side insurance and protection. It has been demonstrated that effective risk monitoring needs to estimate severity and possibility of damage and compare them with cost of insurance and preparation in order to determine how much to invest in defense, but not to overrate the potential risk. If potential risk is overrated, and to much is paid for preparation, development is delayed. Obtaining knowledge about potential risks, damage and overall impact is crucial for the proper assessment of the required prevention and protection steps. Also, very important issue is recovery after serious damage, fast reaction decreases loss of not making development because of dealing with negative effects. This was not an easy task, while playing the game there was a lot of situations when right decision needs to be made quickly, and there is no second chance.
