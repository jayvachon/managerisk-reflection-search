1. ANS:
The knowledge areas require attention to the water levels acquired from the
water board, knowledge of seismic activities and the insurance coverage in
relation to the number of homes built due to limited amount insured. It was
difficult to gauge the preparation of risks with respect to the limited premium
paid for risk protection. Again the challenges in terms of research not in line
with the amount insured by the risk could not come in handy. The role of risk management
was research for the potential and repeating threats due to floods and seismic
activities and to mitigate and protect the community.2. ANS:
I was monitoring the barometer and the level of risk by the hit of each meteor
in my second attempt, and in the third was calculating the premium of risk as
against the number of homes which was the problem in my fist two attempts due
to lack of sufficient insurance premium to cover the damages caused.3. ANS:
The research conducted earlier leads to either evacuating the residents in
advance over a specific period of time knowing when these activities occur; or
if is a rare occurrence the evacuation space for the residents living in the
community and the time this would take to successfully complete without the
loss of human life are the aspects including the cost that would be incurred which
will be the focus.
