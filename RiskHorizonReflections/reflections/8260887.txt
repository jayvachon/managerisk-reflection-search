In the game I had to count with the scarce resources a small
society has. This is a very important technical part of risk management. There
wasn’t a long time for making decisions and for developing, and there wasn’t
enough money to make sufficient investment to researches and protection, but
also take out insurance. Indeed, people have limited time and capacity to
process information on risks and to decide which risk prevention measures they
will implement in „real life”. 

Research means here getting information on risk and using
that information to makes judgement. The researches could help to make
decisions with indicate the severity and the probability of the disaster you have
to breast with. Making more research on one comet decrease the severity,
because we have then better technology.

 Insurance is a few-time
cost and is worth while, contrasting to the high prices of reconstruction, but
if you want the population to be more secure from the disasters, you have to
confront trade-offs and settle for less knowledge about the risk or the lower
level of protection accepting a greater uncertainty. 

Playing that game several times was useful to better
understand the technique. It was useful, for instance, that I could study at
the end of levels which level of probability means  almost-certain, and which level means
unlikeliness of the hit or the catastrophe. I learnt how not to be
overconfident about avoiding loss.  I
also learnt that I can’t do one stategy for a long time, moreover, there isn’t
a perfect stategy for a long time. You always have to pay attention to the
news, but you shouldn’t always develop. Sometimes it’s better to wait. For
example, if you see that a comet is coming that have a very high probability to
cause a disaster, you can’t do anything, you have to cope with the outcome
afterward, but time is scarce, and you then have even less time for developing.


It was also a well-created part of the game, and is very
logical, that you can’t make do with a good insurance without a certain level
of protection. If you develop the pods, the cost of repairing (even with the
insurance!) is more and more expensive, and needs too many time, which is
scarce. Instead of that strategy, you have to decrease the probability of the
disasters broadly, to have more time for developing.

If I could change something about this game, I would make
the game more specific and realistic. One can get use to the game, but it
doesn’t help people who want to know how good „risk managers” they are. . The
trade-offs are unvisible . We don’t know what protective measures we took while
increasing the level of protection and how do it helps. I can’t manage my
instructions with racionality, because I don’t have a table with the summing-up
of the distribution of costs. So, if I had the opportunity, I would put a summing-up
table in the screen.



I also missed the real-life obstacles from the game. I liked very
much the transparency about what prevented people from managing risk
effectively -- I wanted to use it! I also missed the vertical distribution of the risk management tasks (ok,
the community helped in case of catastrophes). First at last, I enjoyed the
game.
