The role I played in the game is as a decision maker or a big boss. I have to take lots of aspect into account to reach the requirement of sucess, say developing speed, preparation for protection based on the evaluation, insurance in the case there's no time to prepare for the incoming flood. Actually there're often in two scenario. First is there enough time for me to upgrade the protection to make it strong enough to against the flood severity. The other is the star moving fast and the severity level is high, there's no time to upgrade the protection to withhold the flood, so usually I will consider to buy an insurance to reduce the loss. When I first played this game, I just followed my feeling, so failed quickly. Then before I played again, I walked through the game's instruction carefully and found that I can click the star to get the detail about the star to get my preparation more efficiently and effectively. So the performance in the second try is much better than the first time. And After 3 tries, I felt I've got much deeper understanding about this game, it required you to keep a good balance between development and risk preparation, and you need to foresee the potential risk may be happening in the future and get proper protection for it---trying affecting little of the development space.I think risk management is about how to against future's uncertainty, however, as technology advanced, it's possible to give the possibility of the occurrence of certain kind of risk. So I would add the possibility of occurrence different kind stars and the severity of the flood caused by the star in the game, to manage the risk more scientifically.
