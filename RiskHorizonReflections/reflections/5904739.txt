I played the game three times. I achieved the fourth level at first, but I only built 4 pods and upgraded them into higher level ones. I raised the ground when the comet cames, which seems can ensure the bar color basically in green, But I ignored the community's power this time and made almost no connection, so even though I paid a lot for the highest level of insurance coverage, the damage is always high after each hit. Besides, I have raised the island into the highest altitude for avoid the wave.Then the second time I changed my strategy. I built as much pod as I can but cannot upgrade them a lot since it costed too much for the construction. I still kept the highest level of insurance, and did pay more attention to build the connection of each pod to make it a closely connected community. This time, the damage has been controled into a low level, and most damage even has no damage at all. This let me understand that the power of community is even much higher than buying the best insurance. And this is the most effective way for risk management. What's more, I kept raising the island into the highest level in order to get it protected from the wave riske. And it seems a good way to earn the points(cash) sometimes. The last time, I started to balance the cost and benefit. Since I have tried the extreme way before, one for less pods without enough connection among each other but well upgraded themselves, and the another one spending the least for upgrading but having built as much pod as possible for good connections among each other, I noticed that the community is the least expensive method to control the risk into the least level of damage. Thus, I started to build reasonable quantity of pods, half of the all possilbe ones, and make them all well connected and developed in the same level of upgrading. In the meanwhile, I am not in such a hurry to raise the island's level whenever there was a comet coming, and tried to raise it only  into the necessary level only for the wave risk. And I found that I could earn some points and cash when I raised it into the needed level, but will spend more when I raised it too much.Besides, I found the cost of insurance cannot mitigate any damage. I paid much less in the 3rd trial for insureance,which saved me a lot of cost for build more pods and make it all connected. And the damage from the hits are quite well controlled by this well build community, and some of the sever hits even has no damage at all. The highest damage rate is only 17% this time, while it was 50% for the first trial and 34% for the 2nd. I used the theories from this course for deciding the steps of risk control and management. The incentive is obviouse in the game, and  I studied the information of the risk, the details of each comet to make a quick decision for the next step, and I tried to balance the resource consumption when the risk came. What I have learnt especially from the different approach in the 3 trials, is that:1) Insurance is the easiest way when we have enough financial support but can only help when the damage has occurred, and not protection from the damage.2) The most effective measurement is to build up the good community and make power enough.
