This game is actually a stimulus about a community,
in which the risks occurs frequently and unpredictable and the player takes the
role of a decision-maker and try to manage the risk to limit the damage and
enlarge the outcome. 

 

When I was playing, I took the insurance and the
research more seriously than the protection. After the game began I chose immediately
the best option for the insurance before building the pods. While building the
pods I updated the protection. If a comet came out I decided how to the accumulate
research by the chance and the severity of the hitting. Generally I kept the
relative high level of the protection and low level of the research so I did
not have enough money to update the pods. I lose the game at Level 4.

 

Mein problem is that I developed the risk
management but ignored somehow the pods. If that is a real village in the world,
that means I have finished all the projects protecting the village but my
people are died from poverty. So if I play the game again I’ll reduce the
development of insurance and protection to some extended and focus on the
updating of the pods.

 

If I am tasked developing a new version of the game, I would add a bottom of
education at the very beginning of the game, which allows the player to get the
information or power of protection and insurance step by step, or the education,
which could improve the rate of upgrading of the protection. The Truth is that
when the people change their ideology and regard the risk management as a tool
for development, the execution would be quicker and better.
