.The game has contextualized and
served to identify to me the different types of risks or shocks that an
initiative is exposed and vulnerable to (floods, famine, drought, economics
collapse or small house-hold shocks such as job loss) and the three main
mitigating options that are available to practitioners (Research, Protection
and Insurance)

My learning from the game is that
as custodian of development one must be aware that with development come risks.
However, risk should not be considered as a deterrent for the pursuance of development.
Therefore, one should be aware of and efficient at balancing the mitigating
cost against the development cost. Failure to efficiently manage these costs
will result in a loss of time, money and rate of progress. I further learnt the
value of the three mitigating factors;

Research has proven to be a vital
tool in the process since it prepares one for every eventuality by informing of
the severity of the shock, the changes of the probability of an impact and
guides as to the level of protection that is required. This is important since
protection can be costly and therefore requires an allocation of scarce
resources. What research actually provides is the requisite data for the
conduct of a cursory cost benefit analysis for the entire project. I had often dedicated
much time to research in a trade-off for protection. 

Protection, though costly, is
necessary to reduce the severity of the impact of the shocks on the infrastructure
or society. The higher the level of protection, the higher the level of
resilience of the development and therefore will expose stakeholders to lower
level of stress and or suffering. The game notes highlights that advanced
technology can lift an entire community out of danger.  Therefore, in every way possible, technology
should be employed in the protection effort, since it has the capacity to provide
a wider range of coverage. In the game, protection was very difficult to
achieve since time wise, one had to trade-off between protection and research 

Insurance serves to transfer some
risks, where recovery from damages is less expensive and quicker. Insurance can
be expensive base on the scale of the development and the level of risk exposure
that is established. There were three levels of insurance protection available
in the game. Community connection is deemed a type of insurance via a form of
mutual aid in long-term protection and general insurance. In circumstances
where the shock is community based, such as natural disasters, connected
neighbourhoods will support each other and will tend to cope and recover in a
quicker time. With adequate insurance, the project development can swiftly resume
its activities with minimum loss of time. 

Balance and decision making is the
strategic element of the game and risk management. Cost is measured in either
time or resources and the more advanced the development the higher the cost
will be to protect it. As a result, the law of diminishing returns emerges
since one can be inclined to over expend in one area in its efforts at
protection.  The game, as it is in life,
requires constant monitoring of the entire process in order for full control
and efficiency to be achieved. In the game, time constraints were an ever-present
factor, which affected how successful one was and the frequency of that
success.

If I were to enhance the game in
anyway, I would allow for more time for players to execute in a way that would
test their comprehension of the theories rather than speed work. Protection and
research should not compete for the same time allocation.
