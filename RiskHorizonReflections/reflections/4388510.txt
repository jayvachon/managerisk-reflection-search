This is to briefly provide my reflection on
'the world of Alora' game. The whole argument of the game is how to develop
communities' resilience on reducing risk associated with the comets. Thus,
the task of the game player is to save the Alora from the shocks created by the
comets. Thus, here it provided the role of the risk management, the trade-offs
and choices, preparation in mitigating the risk, and also the frequency of the
risks and the experiences gained in tackling similar challenges. 

In the game it is vivid that the communities
challenges are clear but the problem reminded on the risk management on how to
prepare, take multiple actions in reducing the consequences of the risk
(proactive measures) and how to reduce the damages created by the risk – in this
case the comets. The role of risk management was clear as it main causes of the
risk are identified, but the challenged remained on how the human’s response
can make huge change in reducing the damage.

In this case, the trade-offs and choices were
critical as the risk manager was forced to take two or more choices into consideration
expecting the results would be positive but sometimes it was happening the
damage was being created – though it was without damage or with varied degree
of damage like 7%, 40%, etc. Thus, which part of the community to deter from
the comets and at what time require risk management knowledge while looking for
the prevention side of the process. Insurances play great role as if they were
used at the right time and pace, they were helpful in saving the lives of the communities
and reducing damages. The positive role of insurance was clearly seen while
sometimes using it in unavoidable damages was a lost in resources and
opportunities. 

The preparation of the risk management was
critical as the levels of damage and material and psychological responses were
highly dependent of it. So in the game the level of preparation was affecting
in developing risk management responses and its resultant on the development of
the communities. This implies while building the power of taking proactive
action or timely responding to the source of the damage (the comets) have been affecting
the development of pods. 

The game illustrated that the frequency of the
risk can lead to the power of learning and gaining knowledge in both preparing
for it and also identifying potential responses or risk reducing measures. The
first time played led to much loss and being confused which to action to take
and at what time. However, the more the risk experienced the more knowledge and
practice in managing it gained. This led in the game in increasing the level of
achievements from one to fifth. 

The game perfectly serves to the purpose. My suggestion
on the game is only if it the first four levels would be in ‘easy’ mode many
people could enjoy the game more. As I can experienced the first two levels are
easy (probably the third also) but level four is very difficult to get there.
Thus, if the first four levels would be at the easier levels and level four and
five could be for those who can achieve more and can be awarded a bonus marks.
