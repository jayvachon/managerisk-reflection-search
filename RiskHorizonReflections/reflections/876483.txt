The role of risk management in the game is to minimize the possible loss of damage while maintaining a good level of development. I kept a balance between building up new blocks, upgrading blocks, and a good insurance level. At the beginning I focused on building up new blocks since the severity of hit was not too high. As the game progressed, I spent more on insurance (75%) and successfully minimized the damage.  In the later attempts, I maintained my horizon at a very high level, which help me avoid a lot of hits and saved a great amount of money. Upgrading also plays an important role. The upgraded blocks showed better ability to predict and protect. I played the game a couple of times. The thing I learned from the game is to insure generously, as it not only prevents you from hit but also speed up your development. I spent too much on repairing in the first two attempts whereas avoid almost every hit in later attempts. The damage really jeopardize my level of development, which led to fails in the beginning. Also upgrading is vital too as it causes less damage and more resource. I would add some third parties for example, the role of international community, government, local community, as they are able to offer resources. To my knowledge, there third parties can considerably contribute to maintaining a healthy level of  development, in particular in the repairing process(ie. coping).
