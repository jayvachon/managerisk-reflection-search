Risk management is inherent to any activity in life. In this
game, development of pods showcased the opportunity side while the comets
showcased the risk side. Idea behind the game was to illustrate that risk and
opportunity are the two sides of the same coin and they both go hand in hand.
There is an inherent tendency in any human being to just go on building the
pods without worrying about the comets or the havoc it might cause. Because
protection against the comets has a cost associated with it, there is this tendency
to invest that amount in development of pods rather than in acquiring
protection against. Moreover to acquire sufficient protection that will not
exhaust all your resources, such that you will not be left with anything for
development, requires planning and also studying the comets and the possible
devastation impact it might have.

I played the game only once and I was able to clear all the
levels. It is so because I had already been through the tutorial section in the
website and also had the notion of risk management and insurance well imbibed
in me. If I am to play the game one more time, I would probably not buy any
insurance or protection to understand the importance of risk management more.

 

The one point I found missing and would like to add in my
version of the game is the negative impact of unplanned growth. Growth or
development is as such a good notion, unless it is in harmony with the nature,
however if it becomes unplanned it does cause problems. It’s my belief that
this point isn’t captured well enough in this game. That would be the one
aspect I would wish to add.
