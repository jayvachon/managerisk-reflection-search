Game reflection

By: Luis Felipe Niño

 

The risk
management were explained through the game in such a simple way, it let us
understood that you cannot put all the eggs in the same basket and that there
is not a single way to reach development, you have to combine your skills and expertise
to sketch a plan.  

I began
trying to develop my village as fast as I could but I forgot about the
equilibrium I had to have between knowledge, protection and insurance so my
village was suffering a lot under the attack of meteorites and it was a failure
rights the way. So I understood that is not a rampant development that was
going to make my strategy a success instead of that you have to achieve a way
that makes happy every single angle of it.

Preparation
for risk development sometimes affects the development of the village because
it stops for a couple of seconds the “development bar” that indicates how far I
was at the moment. But at the end preparation offer a lot more of goods things
that bad ones so I was a reasonable trade off.

If I would
just play the game once I think I would combine better the resources I have,
for the very first levels I think I would invest more funds in knowledge first
so I can identify the magnitude of the problem and then try to face it with
protection because the attacks usually were not that hard when the game begins.
Later on, I would spend more money on insurance because they risks are higher
and rebuilding the village is way too expensive to face it with our own
resources alone. 

In the
other hand, If I would play the game more than once I definitively would try
different combinations of preparation and insurance, but I would always begin acquiring
knowledge of the problem because if you don’t know what you are facing you wouldn’t
know to do it right.

To make the
game a little bit more realistic I would add a couple of external factor like diseases
and population that reflect how people are taking advantage of the development
or suffering the consequences of the lack of leadership and proper risk
management.
