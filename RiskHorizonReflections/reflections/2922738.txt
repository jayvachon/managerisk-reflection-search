Risk management played a critical role in the game. Throughout the game there was the ever-present threat of meteors threatening your development pods. These were ranked differently and each showed different levels of risk to the pods. However, their potential impact on your development was devastating. As such, insurance played a key role in success. When I began playing the game, I initially was very hesitant to develop the pods. I overvalued the risk of the meteors based on the lack of data I had on them. I began playing without looking at the tutorials and simply dove straight in. I didn't know the meteors had different rankings, and I had no idea of the relative impact they could cause. I also had no idea there was so much of a push for development of the pods. As such, I played it in a relaxed, weary manner. I did not opt to develop out of fear, a fear that was in the end unfounded.On the second occasion, I played the game after going over the tutorials. This was a much smarter option and gave me a much better understanding of the relative risks of the different meteors, as well as the potential value in development. This encouraged me to develop fast. I built many pods and tried to develop on the ones I had. However this was also based on uninformed benefits of fewer developed pods as opposed to many undeveloped pods. I then purchased insurance covering 75 per cent of my losses. This proved vital as I was hit a number of times after I initially established my pods. I am not sure whether it was absolutely necessary to cover for 50% of the losses as opposed to 75% of the losses, but this is what I felt was best to do. It would be interesting to see whether this was an unnecessary cost or not.However, considering the number of meteors that hit, it seemed that the insurance was very effective. In the second level I only purchased 50% insurance as I was more rapidly expanding my development. This however cost me a lot as I was hit multiple times by meteors and the impacts seemed to increase with time in the game. This taught me the value of insurance. But it also taught me the vulnerabilities of developed pods which were extremely costly to repair. However, due to the number of investments, monetary flows were maintained and minimal repairs were made.If I could change one thing about the game, it would be to add interconnectivity between the pods. It seemed that the impacts on one pod did not affect the other pods, nor the cost of repairs or the revenue intake. As such, one could simply maintain a few pods while the others were still damaged and returns were no different. In my life, it seems that impacts are much more interconnected, and as the impacts of disaster increase, so too do the costs of repairs across the system as opposed to isolated damages and repairs.
