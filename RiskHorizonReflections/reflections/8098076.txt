             The RISK HORIZON game did
epitomize a very important role of Risk Management in the whole setup of the
game. The development of pods in the provided area needed to be carried through
keeping in mind the attack of the comets that varied in severity.             The trade-offs particularly faced
with respect to knowledge, protection and insurance that I was confronted with
throughout the game included the decision to utilise the right amount of
resources available with me to develop the pods, as also to precisely measure
the severity of falling comets on the pods and the level of protection required
to neutralise the severity of falling comets or from preventing the damage. If
the same can’t be done, appropriate insurance shall be made available to cope
with the damage to developed pods and the repairing cost thereon.              I particularly chose to develop
the first levels of the pods that went on to cost me around $200 per pod
initially, and by the time I reached to the 3rd and the 4th
levels, I realised that further development cost on each pod was a costly
affair amounting to almost $701 per pod. But in my second attempt for the game,
I chose to develop as many number of level-1 pods as possible with the
resources available and then spent on a single upgrade rather than multiple
upgrading of  developing pods, so that I
can utilise rest of the funds for the insurance and upgrading the level of
protection from the comets. The main thing that I got to learn from the game as
a whole is that utilising the right amount of resources and spending on the
required facilities to be made available are key points to be kept in mind for
effective risk management. This is to say that insurance and protection should
be given equal importance as is given to the development of pods after having
acquired the knowledge of the risk that the pods are confronted with.             If I were to design a new version
of this game, I would prefer to provide the candidates with a little more
amount of money, as also shall cost “development levels” little lower than what
they were charged. But yes, the game - RISK HORIZON is a great example for
learning how to be able to effectively manage risk with the restricted amount
of resources available and under strict time constraints.           Briefly, once risks have been
identified, they must then be assessed as to their potential severity of impact
(risk or loss) and to the probability of occurrence. These quantities can be
either simple to measure, in the case of the value of a lost building, or
impossible to know for sure in the case of the probability of an unlikely event
occurring. Therefore, in the assessment process it is critical to make the best
educated decisions in order to properly prioritize the implementation of the risk management plan.









            
Even a short-term positive improvement can have long-term
negative impacts. The risk management plan
should propose applicable and effective security controls for managing the
risks. It is also important to keep in mind the distinction between risk
and uncertainty. The fundamental difficulty in risk assessment is the determination
of rate of occurrence since statistical information is not available. Furthermore,
evaluating the severity of the consequences is often quite difficult for
intangible assets. Nevertheless, risk assessment should produce such
information for the management of the organization that the primary risks are
easy to understand and that the risk management decisions may be prioritized. Thus,
there have been several theories and attempts to quantify risks.
