Response to Question #1:I am going to be perfectlly honest in my assessment of this assignment (I have no idea if I have 400 words woth of assessment to say). I have no idea what the role of risk managmeent was in this game. I could not get past the first level before I sincerely no longer care about the points I could be awarded. It was an infuriating experience. I am an instructor in the areas of public administration, public policy, and political science. I am not sure I would have used this technological, space-grabbing greedy little game in any of my courses! It would have been nice if the game gave me a situation I could actually work with (not something flying in from outer space).Question #2 is a mute point, obviously!Response to Question #1:I might have used river flooding as a situation, or an ice storm. I think I would have preferred to think about a situation using the knowledge I have about emergency services in my area, services and resources that might be triggered through federal programs; anything but a space cadet game!I am obviously not happy and even though a can appreciate the readings in the course I will probably give up on thinking about requesting a certificate!
