The
Risk Horizon Game is a typical scenario in the developing world where both rapid
developments and great exposure to risks are anticipated. It is impossible to
assume no risk in development, as pointed out in the World Development Report
2014. The best approach for policy makers and project executives is therefore to
deploy suitable risk management strategies alongside the development
accordingly. Following from that, with greater development, more risks need to
be assumed. The increase in the cost of risk management tools including protection,
insurance and the coping mechanism was noted as the game advances- This holds
true as a developing country transcends to a developed country. Beyond the
simple model, a complete process of risk assessment and management was also demonstrated:
Acquiring knowledge, obtaining insurance and protection, and ex post risk
management once the risk have materialized. The process should not be linear;
instead, the proposed strategies should be constantly monitored and adjust
accordingly to ensure continuous improvement. 

 

While
the game captured most of the important elements of risk management, it may be
more beneficial for the wider public if some extra features can be included.
Above all, the lack of the presence of deep uncertainties is rather
disappointing. It was noticed that in real life, uncertainties puzzle the
experts and hinder the risk control, and cannot be overlooked or underestimated.
Some of the well-known examples are global warming and the 2008 financial
crisis. Putting into the context of the game, these deep uncertainties can probably
be represented by, for example, a sudden attack from aliens in a neighbourhood planet.

 

Throughout
the game, one saw the ongoing conundrum of balancing resources. Over-investment
in development results in a vulnerable system exposed to all types of risks. As
ex post risk management is usually more costly than ex ante risk managements,
such strategy is certainly not feasible in most cases. Alternatively, having a
strong protection and insurance will undesirably devour resources available for
development which is also far from ideal. The optimal therefore lies between-
It is impossible and not economical to assume no risks at all. Certain amount
of risk needs to be taken as it comes hand-in-hand with opportunities. 

 

Furthermore,
the compromise between insurance and protection should not be ignored. I played
the game twice. The reason of failing in the first attempt was due to the
irrational risk management strategy- Having maximized my protection and purchased
insurance which had better compensation scheme. Powerful insurance makes
high-level protection redundant, and vice versa. The second attempt was better:
I adapted insurance as my primary risk management tool, and complement that
with mid-to-low level protection. The approached established a better balance
between resources and saw a greater success in advancing through the game. Lastly,
it is important to react and make decisions based on available knowledge under
the given time constraint. The time-dependent nature of all risks limited the
amount of knowledge one could acquire before risks materialise. The first key
to the success then lies in the quality of the information and the followed-up
analysis using appropriate models and sensible methodologies.
