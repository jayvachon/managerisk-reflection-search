Risk Management helped you build the ponds and evolve by avoiding the damage createds by comets, or at least by reducing it. When i started the game actually for the first time i did a very basic mistake- i tried to build without insurance and protection and i ended up by losing too fast. From the above experience i understood that the result is that you cannot have growth without having the relevant protection, but you cannot have also protection without having knowledge. (when was the comete going to strike etc). The difficult part was to combine all these and manage to develop while also keeping the development secure. In the end i came to understand also that everything was pointless if there was not the insurance part- you are unable to avoid all strikes, but you can minimize or wipe out the damage.So if i had the chance to play the game only once i would try to have more balance in the way i used development and risk management. By giving all resources only to avoid and protect you cannot develop. By trying to develop as fast as you can you risk to lose it all.. It seems easy but in the end it is not!I live in Greece, in a country were we face a lot of earthquakes. Risk management there is very important; earthquakes are very dangerous especially when you leave in a city and you face the danger of buildings collapsing. Mostly the problem we have is the lack of  knowledge in order to build a more effective risk management. As a result i would give perhaps in the game a better description in the research part, as i found it the most difficult part in the game also. It would be perhaps better if we could in some way predict better when it will strike and how exactly is the impact reduced according to each protection measure taken.
