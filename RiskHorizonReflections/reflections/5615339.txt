1. Role of risk management is to strive for growing the cities to meet the growth requirement, while keeping an eye on the asteroids and perform a quick assessment of its risk and probability of hit the star. The trade-off is to invest more resources in insurance or anti-flood precautionary procedures rather than growing the star. These anti-flood precautionary measures proved to be very useful as they helped overcome less-damaging asteroids hit - resulting in majority of the hits there were no damage.2. The first time I set up insurance level to 75% at level 1 which proved to be a really waste of money. The subsequent trials, I initially invested a lot in to anti-flood precautionary procedures (more than the potential damage of the satellite). One of the things I still wonder is how much money I have to invest before the anti-flood level can be increased by 1 level. 3. There might be a "missile" option which fires a missile to the asteroid and by chances either reduce its probability of hitting the star or break the asteroid into smaller pieces thus lowering the damage potential. The missile serves as a precautionary procedure as well and requires monetary input for research and development. - This would provide a further trade-off to be considered when players assess the risks and opportunities as they carry on the game.
