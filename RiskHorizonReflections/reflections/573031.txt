1. Risk management lead to propagation - without risk management the game would not proceed, the civilization would die and prosperity would stagnate or even decrease. For me it worked well using a mixture of research, protection and fast developement of hubs. Insurance was not really neccessary. Preparation for risk was affecting short term developement in a negative way, but after some time led to more security and therefor more ressources available for development of hubs.2. I played the game 3 times. After the first time I learned that risk management is more important than I thought before. After the second time I invested more time in research. I learned that just the right mixture of development, knowledge, protection and insurance leads to success.3. I live in germany. I would add a long term component to the game: If you want to develop a hub, you should have the choice between two prices: The first is a low price which affects long term development with a by time increasing negative component representing "fast development by fossil energy but thereby destroying nature". The second price would be a higher one which affects long term development in a positive way representing "slower but ecological and sustainable development without destroying nature".
