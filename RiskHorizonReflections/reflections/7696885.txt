The Game helps you evaluate and think of the different mechanism for risk management and their balance in view of the limited information (research) on probability and severity of impact. The different options of researching more the comets (info), building pods (and later upgrading them, more expensive if flooded), protecting (elevating the island) and buying different levels/costs of insurance made you test and reflect of what option is better in view of the different comets coming down. The Game adequately, and harshly, reflected some the randomness of events and effects (misses, different levels of damage, etc.), the mix of instruments to manage and protect from the risk and further development.I played the game some seven times failing twice level 1 and the rest level 2, and although I did perceive the effects of the different mix of risk management options, was still frustrated (as in real life) of the randomness of effects (sometimes I thought I had over-protected in face of the expected  severity while other times I thought I had under-protected, and the effects were the opposite of what I expected- ie, no damage when I thought I was under-protected and lots of damage when I was protected AND insured. So finally I concluded that although there are instruments and measures, coping and resilience will continue to be a necessary ingredient in high risk areas..... sorry Chile, Japan, California (for natural disaster risks)... and Sub-Saharan Africa, Bolivia, Nicaragua, etc. for poverty and food security, etc., risk management can only go so far...The game introduces initially 4 elements of risk management and later a fifth by pooling/networking communities; a more sophisticated version would introduce the HUMAN factor of risk acceptance/culture in different Pods, i.e., some pods would have higher risk aversion others lower, and you can spend resources in training/awareness campaigns at each Pod, so as to elevate the risk awareness and propensity to protect and save at each community (instead of having all Pods cost the same at every level). As we know well from all the literature, culture and propensity to risk protection is higher in certain cultures and regions, while in others (with the same level of development) there is a greater tendency in having family and neighboring communities share the risk and coping measures (view the Cohesion funds of the EU vs the small cohesion funds in other developed regions , which rely more on their own resources and generally if there are pooled funds it's only for after-disaster reconstruction). Other game improvements/upgrades would introduce a systemic risk management method, ie, you could spend resources in establishing a "system" not only individual measures and the system would have levels, for example only the system design would have a small initial cost, later strict implementation (project management) system would have a higher cost; finally the same with Monitoring and evaluation (ME or Audit as in the ISO management systems) would cost even more, etc. This game could also be part of a "set of games" which also have other modules for project management of risk systems, for monitoring, evaluation and audit, and for financial calculations /modelling (simple ones of course). This would form a "Comprehensive Risk management)Well it was fun to play, the Game is quite good compared to what we use for business training; at my consulting firm TenStep we also have a project management simulation game - http://www.tenstep.com/open/miscpages/90.6.PM50.00PMSimulation.html  , which uses a Swiss software www.sts.ch, also with a random generator of effects based on probabilities, and an algorithm for taking decisions on the different project decisions- team, scope, quality , etc.)
