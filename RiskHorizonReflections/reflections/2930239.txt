   I think that primary message of this game is to show that everything costs time and money. So you must invest in research, protection and insurance and balance those to minimize costs in order to achieve some confidence that risk effect will have a low impact.    Another point is about time. This game also point that time is going so if you loose the opportunity and do not make a right decision at right time the risk impact will grow exponentially.     To summarize this game outlines three subjects which you have to deal with in risk management: Resources (money)TimeBalance between Development, Research, Protection, Insurance and TimeResources.Another question is about play this game once and play it again. What do I would do differently?It depends if the second time will be identically as first time I mean that the same meteors will hit the same place so everything will be repeated. In this way will know how things will evolve and choose the best strategy in order to meet the game objective.But in real life the things happens differently with a random probability. And we are not able to predict or know in advance what will happen.  Also during this game you can find that early investigation in risk preparation have a big impact on development. So you should assume a risk tolerance threshold and start invest into risk preparation after reach this threshold. In this way you'll have some money in order to keep or raise development.  So if I will be tasked to develop a new game version I'll add a new parameter risk tolerance. For sure it will introduce some complexity into game but it will describe better how we deal with project management in real life. Also the game didn't reveal the abstraction or the root cause of the problem in risk management. It doesn't show that we try with finite characteristics timemoney to solve or control infinite sets of factors which affect or have an impact on Development and Risk management.As a result of this game or knowledge that can be applied in real life in my environment or place where I live, I want to emphasize the following:   We always can find a way to deal with effects of undesirable phenomenons. Just make the right decisions at the right time and do not loose the opportunities.
