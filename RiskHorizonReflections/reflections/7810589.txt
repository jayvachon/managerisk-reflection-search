This game makes you a risk manager and it helps you think about dificulty of this responsability. In this game you have to managing risk and you do it developing houses, engaging insurances or involping protection. In each level, I improved those houses, I engaged an insurance and I improved protection. All this help me when a meteor hurt my world because it has a lower cost if meteor hit the world. But, with protection I avoided damaged in houses. The preparation for risk affect inmediately because these resources I spend in protection didn't go to world development. But it has a good side because better houses receive lower damages.I have played two times and the second time I spent more dolars on houses development and less on other tools. I evolved houses every round to avoid bigger damages. I have learnt that managing risk is a really difficult responsability and you need a lot of information and think what do you want to do with your limited resources. Also, you shouldn't forget engaged a insurance when it was possible because you can't prevent future problems. To conclude, improving your protection is a very good choice to reduce damages and you can cope new crisis.If I can change the game, i would add any system of financiation because i think this is one of the most important things because if you don't have resources (money in this case) you can not improve protection or engaged insurance.
