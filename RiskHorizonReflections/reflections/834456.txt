In this game, the role of risk management was of a
significant one, it showed the correlation between growths, research,
protection, insurance and most importantly time. During the game I sacrificed
too many upgrades or the growth of the plots to research on the impending
dangers and to protect the area, however I made sure that I had the highest
amount of insurance to make sure that if there was a disaster that I would be
protected but it would take less amount of money to rebuild the plots.
Preparation for risk did affect my development mainly because of time, it took
time to protect, time to upgrade and with the impending dangers coming in so
rapidly and being costly, it caused it to be a little bit difficult to properly
develop my plots and do what was necessary to keep them going effectively.

I played the game more than one time, first I tried building
3 plots and taking care of them, protecting them mostly but hardly doing
research, that failed, so I realized the importance of research and in other
instances, I made sure to research the risk factors, I made sure to protect
myself adequately and always getting the highest amount of insurance, just to
ensure that I would be able to bounce back quickly in the case of a disaster,
even if I didnâ€™t make it to level 2 multiple times, I made improvement by
following the strategy that I came up with but I do think that there are some
major improvements to be made to the game in order for it to be played
effectively, I would play the game again and in different ways just to see if I
could do something differently.

If I were to create a game or be allowed to make changes to
this game, I would create a diversity of risk factors and have them timed
differently, allowing the gamer to be able to properly assess what needs to be
done and try to do it in a timely fashion, I would also add a feature where you
can get help from other parties, in the real world in order to have successful
risk management there must me more than one party involved, this makes for a
better view of things and often times a quicker solution to problems that when
alone, more brain power is essential when executing proper risk management.
