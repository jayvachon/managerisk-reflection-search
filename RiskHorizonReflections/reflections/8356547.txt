The game consists of 4 factors of risk management; defined as knowledge, protection, insurance and coping in the course. There are also; the obstacles faced or scarce resources like time, financial assets and ability to analyze the situation and utilize the tools. First; the level of knowledge or even awareness about the risks should be increased, like increasing the research factor of the comets. Then increase  protection, but it should be balanced with the development activities since too much protection wastes sources of the community which can be directed to development. Insurance can also be used for recovering after a disaster, but financing the costs of this tool should be kept in mind. The last factor, coping abilities of the community which also needs agility in the game, provides after disaster recovery by using networking.     

In the game, comets are the threat against development of the community. And I had to optimize the usage of the resources for the preparation activities, by decision making which had obstacles like limited time, knowledge and skills. Preparation for the risk, either can prevent the damage all together or reduce the degree of damage. Recovery after a disaster is also less costly if you had preparation beforehand.I played the game more than once. The first one lasted too quickly because I didn't do any research about the comets. Since I was involved in learning the other aspects of the game. On other trials as I get familiar with the game, I started to use the factors of the game more effectively. When I paid too much attention on protection for instance, development fall behind. 

This game of simplified model of risk management, can be developed by adding a random option of "guess" about the upcoming comet's feature. If the player is able to guess the feature correctly a bonus maybe given, otherwise a penalty given.
