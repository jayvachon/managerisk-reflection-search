I attempted to Game only once and reached level three failed but on reflection I thought coupled with other people's experiences from the forum I like to practice the factors that affect real risk management If I were to play the game multiple times I would try to see if any one factor influence risk management more than the others all or the is the mix of the various ingredients that is key ,  from my own experience and that of others from the forms on issues they faced I feel the actual trade-off is development ( long-term ) and risk management which is mainly short to medium-term ) measures .Development itself can be seen as a risk management activityit requires knowledge, provides protection and insurance as well is helps us cope after an event of a positive or negative shockThe role of risk management (in general and a lesson from the game)  I feel is to protect development and the population in general of the shocks (negative ) and help them to cope in the event of a shock as well as to help  capitalise on any positive shocks that may come randomly or due to the negative event or shockOne simple addition to the game I would make is that of population. If it is possible to see that people have been affected in terms of life lost from he comet  hitting and when the population is growing in good times then it adds an extra dimension of actual real-world stress that effect all major institutions public or private on the effect and are responsible for actual livesThe main thing that I have learnt from the game is that shocks are inevitable , some , by  chance pass by but overall we cannot avoid them, and sometimes they occur in quick succession .But research and being prepared to cope by all institutions working together is key in the coming quickly for any shock negative or grossed in order to capitalise quickly on positive shocks before others. In real life one of the biggest obstacles is the juggling of time (focus/priority ) and financial budgets to decide what mix of development , knowledge insurance and protection one must have optimally , for any situation , country or specific shock , In the game I found myself spending time looking at shocks  that had low probability that materialised and then time and resources wasted On shocks with a high probability that didn't materialiseIn a changing dynamic world one must first focus on those risk management techniques that cost little in terms of resources and obstacles and prioritise in that week instead of only focus on the five probability of the shockGood shocks must be prepared for as much as bad shocks as they are the key driver of development that is truly the first and most important risk management policyWhat's developed statements to interfere less in individuals and corporate risk-taking and other institutions become capable of handling shocks so that the development and recovery time from shocks like the example of Chile  is shortened .
