Objective: Development of the community.

Risks: Comets

Controls: Research, Protection, Insurance.

My role as risk management was making a
balance between the developments of the community, with protecting against
comets, to achieve the objective.

I played the game more than once. Although
I bought the insurance as the first option, and did the research, and hold the
protection, sometimes the damage was more than 50%, but the cost of repair was
lowest than without protection.

The game is interesting because I had to
take decisions about what to do first, and looking to the horizon for the risk
of turn up a new comet, and make new decisions respecting the severity and
chance of hit.  When I had time, I could
repair the pods, but some impacts are at the final, so it’s difficult to
achieve the objective.

I couldn’t past the third level, but I tried
to implement different strategies, like investing more in research if the
severity and chance of hit was low, or changing for protection, if the severity
and chance of hit was higher.

About the third part, the explanation of
the impact for me is not clear, so I suggest the evaluation of other ways to do
it, in future versions.

Thanks,
