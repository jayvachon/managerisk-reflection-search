The game provided us the basic knowledge so as to how to maintain a proper balance between different components of risk management ,widout disturbing the process of development.To make sure that the community remains on a development path rather than brisking away from it, risk management plays an important role. As once a calamity hits , if no proper precautions are taken, the time and expense required to reconstruct it is much more than the preparation cost of risk.Since resources were scarce, a proper allocation was required among research, protection ,insurance and development.Selection from various component made the game chalanging,life like and fun to play.I have gained immense knowlenge from the game.Firstly,how to focus on Â frequent threats,the probalilty of which were higher and the distracting attention from those comets which were likely to be missed.Secondly,i learned to take preliminary measures of researching,protecting and ensuring the pod.I even learnd the process whereby keeping development away from stagnation. Though the initial cost of risk management seemed huge but once the comet struck we realised it as a huge boon.The recovery path was much easier so risk management seemed as a nice optin as it is rightly said "prevention is better than cure."In my first try the game semed to be a bit difficult.But as i gradually procceded,with my every try i explored new tricks which helped me a lot to gain the knowledge of how to manage risk.Intially,risk management seemed to be a easy task but in practice it is not so.Though prevention is necessary yet too much focus on prevention may hamper my development process.Proper knowledge of funds is required otherwise development and prevention would not be possible.This clearly shows why risk mangement is so much important for our society.As we know risk is perenial,if i was entrusted with the task of developing a new version of the game I would have added other risks along with the areial risk as is seen in the game.In reality we face various kind of risk,where the poor people are traped in the vicious circle of poverty and it seems impossible for them to get out of it.In order to relief them i would advice to propose some financial backup which could persuade them to take risk and to improve the living condition.Thus,risk management helps to take up new oportunities and face threats and it helps to reduce our surden decisions and help us to be a wise decission maker.This is all about my experience.
