Dear, Pear: First of all, I must say apologize for my english, spanish is my mother tongue. So sorry about it.The role of the risk management in the game is teach us to take risks and decide with resolution. The risk of inaction can be the worst option of all. I tried to do my best keeping a balance between the growing of my comunity and preparing for the potential shocks of the meteorits. I've been preparing during the game to face the different risks, spending the money in the insurance to can repair the pods after the shocks. I also spent the money in increase the level of protection to protect my community in long term from the waves. I also tried to use the power of research to have more time and create community connectiones before the comet hit us.I played the game twice. First time was terrible, even after played the tutorial. I learned the game system and in the second chance I could played well and put in the game the management of the risks that I had learned in the resources of the week one and two. The most important thing that I have learned from the game, it's that the identify risks is not enough: the trade-offs and obstacles to risk management must also be identified, prioritized, and addressed through the private and public action, in spite of in this case I was the private and the public actor.Being sincere, I would not change many things... Perhaps, I would introduce more options about the infrastructure, as they are need it for people to manage their risks. Moreover I would introduce some technological tools to face the natural crises. With a strong infrastructures and technologic, the robust in a large range of possible scenarios would be guarantee.Â Concluding, risk management can be a powerful instrument for development even of you are playing in a rol game to learn about the risk management.
