I believe that the role of risk management in the game was to learn to appreciate a situation as possible. No mater what to do in our lives has cost either in cash or in time and almost always there are losses in the implementation of our plans. The substance is not afraid of possible losses but to minimize them knowing as possible about the issues that concern us. Playing the game, i gave a little more emphasis on the protection and security and this because while i knew that some comets will hit my buildings, buying maximum insurance had the flexibility to rebound faster after cost me very little. If i were play the game again, i would not change anything. The main thing i learned from this game is that even the simplest things can bring us great difficulties if we don't have a real research and move forward with courage to achieve our goals.
