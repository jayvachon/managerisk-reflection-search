Role of the risk management in the game is to understand the severity and probability of comet strike by research and take necessary measures of cost effective protection, insurance and warning system to prevent or reduce damage due to the comets of various severity and probabilities.The choices i had to make are about the amount of money to be invested in development of new pods, protection level and insurance required based on the severity and chances of comet hit.First action is to research the comet and ensure the right information about the severity and probability of hit.Second action is 33% insurance for situations of low severity comets and 50% insurance for situations of moderate to high severity comets. 75% for very high severe situations (i didnt had the chance to use it in game)Third action is to increase the protection level in accordance with the severity and chances of hit of comet.Fourth action is If the comet is hit, ensure the communication between the pods to maximum to reduce the severity of damage.Fifth action is to repair if the damage has occurredIn parallel, i made sure the building new pods and upgrading of existing pods based on resources available to ensure growth of development with above risk management strategy to meet the target within the time.I have learned the process of implementation of risk management and the results of effective risk management from this game.it helped me understand the situations of information research, estimation of risk, decision making, effective use of resources for risk management in terms of insurance and protection level. More importantly, i could learn the basics of the sustainable development with risk management by trying to meet the target in each level within the target time.This game is broad representation of the situation of risk management and the real life situations are more complex involving various people, organizations and governments. This tool serves the purpose of the checking the basics learnt by the students during the course.I would recommend to add more complexity into the game by multiple comets strike at same time. (Note: i played only till level 5)Besides, shwoing the overall graph for each levelÂ  - severity, chances of hit, protection level and insurance paid after completion of a level. Game should be able to provide feedback on the cost benefit ratio, overestimation/underestimation of risk during play time which resulted in insufficient protection level resulting in losing the game to help students learn from their mistakes.
