The role of risk management in this game is likable to the type that is found in an organizational setting in their day to day operations.The uncertain economic times of the past few years have had a major effect on how companies operate these days. Companies that used to operate smoothly with the help of forecasts and projections now refrain from making business judgements that are set in stone. Now, companies have a renewed focus: to manage risk.

Risk is the main cause of uncertainty in any organisation. Thus, companies increasingly focus more on identifying risks and managing them before they even affect the business. The ability to manage risk will help companies act more confidently on future business decisions. Their knowledge of the risks they are facing will give them various options on how to deal with potential problems.

Risk can come from both internal and external sources. The external risks are those that are not in direct control of the management. These include political issues, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. Internal risks, on the other hand, include non-compliance or information breaches, among several others.

Risk management is important in an organisation because without it, a firm cannot possibly define its objectives for the future. If a company defines objectives without taking the risks into consideration, chances are that they will lose direction once any of these risks hit home.

In recent years, many companies have added risk management departments to their team. The role of this team is to identify risks, come up with strategies to guard against these risks, to execute these strategies, and to motivate all members of the company to cooperate in these strategies. Larger organizations generally face more risks, so their risk management strategies also need to be more sophisticated. Also, the risk management team is responsible for assessing each risk and determining which of them are critical for the business. 

The critical risks are those that could have an adverse impact on the business; these should then be given importance and should be prioritized. The whole goal of risk management is to make sure that the company only takes the risks that will help it achieve its primary objectives while keeping all other risks under control. 

If I were to play this game again, I will approach it more cautiously taking into cognizance those experiences that I have garnered from my first attempt. Organizations face internal and external actors and influences that make it uncertain whether, when, and the extent to which they will achieve or exceed their objectives. The effect this uncertainty has on the organisation’s objectives is risk.

As president and owner of Heuer Insurance Company in Sparks, Larry Heuer is well aware of the catastrophic losses businesses have the potential to experience if they don’t practice appropriate risk management. As an example of sound risk management, however, he chooses to remember a client who suffered a large loss due to a fire caused by a tenant in one of his upscale apartment complexes. “This was a very bad claim, but the client had the right amount of coverage,”1 Heuer explains.

 Having the right amount of coverage meant that the client avoided having to reach into his own pocket to pay for tens of thousands of dollars for the extensive damage to his property. “The purpose of insurance is putting you in the same position after the loss as before,”2 Heuer says.
