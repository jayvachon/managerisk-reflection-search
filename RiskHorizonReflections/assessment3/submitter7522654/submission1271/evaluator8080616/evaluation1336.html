    <div class="field-value">1. What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
At some points the essay seems to simply mirror phrasings from the texts/videos. Though the definitions where in my opinion correctly understood and described, the essay would profit from a correlation of the definitions and the game.
tl;dr Write things like definitions in your own words ;)

2. What is the key strength of this reflection?
The idea of a bigger variety of risks is really something to keep in mind for the staff of this course. Furthermore I liked the writer's writing style, formal but eloquent. Finally I would say the grade of reflection is on a high level. 

Thank you. ;)</div>
