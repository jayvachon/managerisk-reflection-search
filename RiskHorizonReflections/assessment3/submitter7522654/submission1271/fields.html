    <h1>Submission 1271 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7522654, session_user_id: 489be927194d38668966ceb8a170b8cc8b028437)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Horizon is rather a risk management tool that involves understanding  the opportunities for development and the means to grasp them, means to anticipate the risks that come in the face of comets in the game, the importance of investing in research so that there is enough knowledge about the nature and severity of the risk, the various preparation mechanisms like insurance and protection (raising the island as in the case of the game), and  finally , ways to cope with the risks effectively, so that damages can be minimized (by dragging the golden ovals to join them to each other). The aim of the game, which is to maximize development by minimizing damages due to potential risks, is very much in line with the goal of risk management.The latter as we all know is all about increasing the benefits and decreasing the losses that people experience when they face risk.

Once a risk or a comet was seen on the horizon, the first thing that was done, was gaining information about the potential of the risk. Next came the choice or rather the trade off between protection and insurance. Both were a must and were resorted to, much before a risk appeared, but the proportion in which each is to be used, greatly varied depending upon the severity of the risk.  Effective research and preparation for risks should not be seen as a cost but as an investment for future safety. Insurance not only means protection but also facilitates the necessary repair work, whenever there are damages. Apart from all this, effective coping mechanism (promptly joining all the golden ovals to each other once a comet was hit) greatly mitigated the possibility of any damage.It is important to bear in mind at all times that development is the prime concern.Developmental activities must go on at all times. 

Repeated iterations on the game would make one more adept at striking the right balance between protection and risk. It will make one more prompt in development activities as they are the source of fund and eventually time translates into money, so the faster the development happens, the more money one gets. It will also make one more fluent with the coping mechanism. It is also important to understand here that as one reaches higher levels in the game or as society reaches a certain level of development, it needs more fund than before to protect itself from potential risks and to grow further at the same time. Therefore at those levels, the magnitude of risk management should also increase accordingly.

 Even though the game models risk management very well, a further scope for improvement cannot be ruled out. There could be more variety of risks in the game. Apart from comets and rising water levels, there could be earthquakes and so on. Opportunities could also be dealt with similarly. There can be a sample matrix correlating the risk with a given severity, the damage protection levels, and the level of insurance required. This will reduce the random noise factor in the game (specially in making a choice between protection and insurance) and will make the decision making more effective.
