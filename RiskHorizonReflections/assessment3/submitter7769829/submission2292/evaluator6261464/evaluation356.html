The only thing that can improve this reflection is the Clarity of thoughts like I want to quote a point which is confusing "It helped me learn that insurance is only a financial benefit, but investment can be re-newed and re-used to generate funds. Where as in case of insurance, it can not generate revenue by itself, it needs to be re-invested in order to earn something.
