    <h1>Submission 2292 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7769829, session_user_id: e8ff05b4954abe6aec7c95d8c59b8981a1d10e57)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><table><tbody><tr><td><b><u><i>1. Role of
  risk management - </i></u></b><br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td>Risk management plays a even more
  important role than otherwise when the damage is
  unavoidable</td>
 </tr><tr><td>Insurance will only help in a financial
  benefit, but the loss is bound to happen</td>
 </tr><tr><td>In the game, the pod would still be
  damaged inspite of the insurance, and required upgrading.</td>
 </tr><tr><td><u>Choices / Trade offs in case
  of knowledge, protection, and insurance - </u></td>
 </tr><tr><td>The cost of knowledge is the least,
  however it was the most important.</td>
 </tr><tr><td>If the strength was low, it would make
  sense to invest in the pods. However, if the damage would be high, It
  was better to get insured.</td>
 </tr><tr><td><br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td>Hence, <u>preparation for risk</u> could be done
  only with knowledge, which needed a little analysis</td>
 </tr><tr><td><br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td><b><u><i>2. The game - </i></u></b></td>
 </tr><tr><td><u>First time -</u></td>
 </tr><tr><td>I had a lot of idle funds, which were not
  utilized more often.</td>
 </tr><tr><td>Also I failed to utilize the knowledge i was spending on.<br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td><u>Second time - </u></td>
 </tr><tr><td>I used funds as soon as they were earned.</td>
 </tr><tr><td>Hence resulting in a lot of investment over
  insurance, because investment in the pods could be upgraded over and over again, which would also earn income in return. Which was not the same with insurance.<br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td>Also I analyzed the knowledge about the
  pods, and did not act much when the strength was low</td>
 </tr><tr><td><u>Learning from the game - </u></td>
 </tr><tr><td>It helped me learn that insurance is only
  a financial benefit, but investment can be re-newed and re-used to generate
  funds. Where as in case of insurance, it can not generate revenue by itself, it needs to be re-invested in order to earn something.<br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td><br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td><b><u><i>3. To add to the game - </i></u></b></td>
 </tr><tr><td>I would like to add
  "<u>Income/Per-capita income of public</u>" as an indicator of risk
  management for better representation.<br /></td>
 </tr><tr><td>This would show the well being of the
  people of the country, and how well it was managed / retained during the
  crisis.</td>
