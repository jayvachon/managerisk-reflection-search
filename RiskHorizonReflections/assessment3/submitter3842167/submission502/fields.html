    <h1>Submission 502 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3842167, session_user_id: 1fcd3bd456d440a437e0c9552f264cb6a7737740)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management was to find a
way to balance knowledge in terms of research to understand the risks, with
building up the risk preparedness in terms of elevation, with purchasing
insurance, and finally with development. I found that it was incredibly
difficult to balance everything and get the results I desired. I had the
greatest success when I balanced all three, not focusing too much on
development but also not putting too much time or resources into preparedness
when research showed that the risks were not that high. I had to make these
choices to do less development that I would have liked because preparations
cost money that can then not be spent on development. Consequently, preparation
reduced the speed of development over time, but it also meant that there was
minimal to no destruction of buildings when disasters struck</p>

<p>I played the game multiple times to try and
determine what would improve my outcome. No matter what I tried I could not get
past the third level, sadly! I discovered that I needed to develop at
a slow, steady pace to allow myself the time and resources to properly
protect the investments I was making in these buildings. The first time I
played I built too quickly and did not spend enough time on research. I quickly
discovered that my time needed to be split, and a portion of my resources needed to be saved for that and for
insurance that would help in case of a large disaster.</p>

<p>The first time I played I purchased the best insurance right away only to find this was a bit overkill as you move on – the risks of damage were greatest at
the beginning and dramatically lowered as I became further developed, and improved preparation and research. For this reason I purchased the highest insurance
in round one when the likelihood of damage was highest and my financial
resources least able to cope with the strain of rebuilding.
Then as I moved on I purchased lower insurance because I knew that I had
the resources to rebuild if a large disaster hit.  </p>

<p>I would propose a change to the way community was addressed. It is an important factor when considering a society’s resilience
and recovery after a disaster; yet, I did not feel it was adequately
represented. I would prefer to see the game incorporate communication between
community members and different organizations by building
connections between the people who research, build infrastructure, sell insurance, build homes, and live there. Community should be something you can
control in the game to show the impact of good communication, a sense of community,
and relationships between different parts of society. </p></div>
