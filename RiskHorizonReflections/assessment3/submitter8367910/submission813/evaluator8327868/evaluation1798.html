    <div class="field-value">The key strength is the approach the student has taken in this assigment - the reflection offers his/her experiences and thoughts, conclusions alongside with what happened in the game. This shows that the student did learn from the Game and understands the basics of risk management and how certain decisions affect the outcomes. Maybe one thing that could have been added to this reflection were the definitions of knowledge, protection and insurance in the text.
