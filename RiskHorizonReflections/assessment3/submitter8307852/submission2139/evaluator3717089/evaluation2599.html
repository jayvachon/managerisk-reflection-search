    <div class="field-value">The key strenght of this reflection is the understanding of the tools available to make "risk management" and also the self conscience of the balance needed to take the most out of it.
The reflection is very good but I think probably it could be improved if it was more clarified with the trade-offs you have been facing during the game, and what achivements did you get from them.</div>
