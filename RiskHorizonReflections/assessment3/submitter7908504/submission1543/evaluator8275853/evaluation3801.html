    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the respondent's comparison of the game's situation to real-life situations and his/confession of not being a good game player by stating that it could be the same as people could get frustrated in real life when faced with different unusual situations they are not used to.

The one thing that I think would make this reflection better is if respondent had provided answer to the question of the change he/she would have proposed to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place he/she lives she was not provided.
