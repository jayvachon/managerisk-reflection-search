    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> </p>

<p>1.The role of the risk Management in this game is to
understand the real impact of the earthquake, what damages it might cause, how
to reduce such the shock such damages by transferring the risk into the
insurance. </p>

<p>The choices I make is that first of all, I tried acquire the
knowledge of how the earthquake is going to happen, when does it happen, and
are it’s impact in terms of severity, destruction, and other damages. After gaining
these knowledge, then I realizes that to protect or to reduce the damages it
might cost is to purchase insurance to cover the re-building the damage
buildings.</p><p> The preparation of the risk as for my part, it really delays my
constructions first, until I studied the incoming natural disasters, how are
they going to hit, and how I think it might cost to re-build the destructed
buildings. So in my point of view, the development is not immediately, is after
some time.</p>

<p> 2. If I played the
game again, I think I may change some of my tactics in terms of studying the
risk, the impact of the disaster, and the insurance to reduce the shock.</p><p> The main
thing I learned from the game is that the more you well understand the risk of
disaster, the better you manages it.</p>

<p>3.The only change I propose is the time. The time to
re-build before another disaster hits is actually very closer. But with atleast
some time and more insurance coverage, I think it might be much more effective.</p>
