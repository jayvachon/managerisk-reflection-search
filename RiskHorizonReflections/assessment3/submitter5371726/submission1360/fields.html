    <h1>Submission 1360 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5371726, session_user_id: a1eabfac7e440553d401ce81030bfa190bfb04a6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was to protect your buildings whilst ensuring that you spent enough money of upgrades in order to meet your quota. I knew that there was a chance that I would get hit by comets but I had to weight that up with the fact that I couldn't spend all my money of defense. After some time I developed a strategy which I though incorporated the best of both worlds. <br /><br />After playing the game more than once, I realised that it was more effective for me to raise my buildings instead of purchasing insurance. The reason for this is because the raised building lasts for more than one round where are the insurance you have to buy every round and the raised building did not include a time delay after the comet hit. <br /><br />One thing that I would change would be to hae an extra option to shoot the comets out of the air before they got the opportunity to hit you. I didn't think that it was fair that even if a comet was weak that it would take down the level that your planet was raised at. </div>
