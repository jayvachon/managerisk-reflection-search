    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The Risk Horizon game makes us think how to confront the risk that we would face. The concept of the game is clear and compact, the obstacles or meteors in the game coming through a period with different frequencies, given the tools to confront the obstacles, those are research (identify the obstacles and reduce the uncertainty, notify the citizens in the pods, thus, the damage as the impact of crashing meteor is not severe), protection (lift up the ground to reduce the adverse impact by the meteor will hit the ground and make tsunami), and insurance (as the act of coping by "storing savings from good to bad times" principle), those instruments must be used wisely to achieve the goal of each level. In the terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance, the choices I made in the game are varied. The consideration to choice is depended on the situation in the game, if many obstacle coming through I would identify the damage and the hit chance at a glance, if most of them have massive damage, I would take the 50% coverage insurance option, because I consider the money would be better used for other things like make a robust protection, thus I wouldn't take 75% coverage insurance option. If, the obstacles seems have huge damage but very low chance to hit, I wouldn't underestimate them, and still would build a better protection, do a research for certainty and subdue the damage. The preparation that would be made affect many aspects for development, many lives would be saved, the cost of risk could be subdued, thus the coping won't be very difficult.<br /><br />I played the game three times, and learned many things. The first time I played the game, I was focusing on building pods, didn't take the research and the insurance into the account, everything just went smooth, until I failed at level 2, and I wondered why. The second attempt I tried to give my best to protect the pods, bought the 75% coverage issues, fortified the protection to near maximum cap, and did the research to the most harmful meteor,but at the end, when time was over, the bar in the left still went red and didn't reach the goal threshold, thus I failed at level 4. And the third attempt, I tried to balance all of them, prioritized the urgent things with the consideration that I wrote in the first paragraph and built the pods when idle to raise the income thus can reach the goal. Finally I finished level 6 without any difficulties. The main things I learned is those knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping are all important, but they have to be balanced and prioritized depend on the situation.<br /><br />My country Indonesia, has two issues that still difficult to be solved, severe social/behavioral issue like corruption and health issue in some provinces. If I tasked to developing a new version of the game I would add the health issue and the corruption issue to the game. I know it will be more hard to be played, but thinking the health issue and social issue heavily affect the risk management in real world, I think they must be added. If the tutorial of new version of the game is clear and if the player can finish and understand the substance of the game, I believe they will be better in risk management.<br /><br /></div>
