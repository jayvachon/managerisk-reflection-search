    <div class="field-value">This text is very specific and methodical. It speaks of actually visiting risk sites, again I presume somebody with first-hand experience. 
The reflection's strength comes from the part about improving the game.  The proposal of having different valued areas to be redeveloped is of course a no-brainer and much closer to reality.  The highlighting that not all structures are of equal importance to a community, on reflection is obvious when pointed out, but could be easily overlooked as is the case in the game.
Its link to the previous section in the text make it even more poignant.

A very simple improvement to the reflection would have been to re-read the text; some of the punctuation make little sense and lead to some sentences being too short to mean anything. However, for a non-native speaker it is understandable and very informative, well done.</div>
