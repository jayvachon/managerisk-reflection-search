    <div class="field-value">This is a well-structured description, it seems to me that the writer worked hard to fulfill this reflection task.
Sometimes it was hard for me to follow the line, I suggest to revise the writing at least 2 times before submitting. First time to edit the text and correct all the mistakes and second time to get acquainted with the text from the reader's point of view. If you have all the answers and tey are described clearly, you can be more successful.</div>
