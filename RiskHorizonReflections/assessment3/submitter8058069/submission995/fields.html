    <h1>Submission 995 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8058069, session_user_id: 98eac936380dd51d5896bfda5fc2048b24828465)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game brings forth the skills of balancing your risks with the opportunities available.  It reiterates the knowledge aspect coupled with measurements related to the the extent of damage that can occur.  Risk management requires a combination of knowledge with application.  This helps in arriving at the exact details of the risk perceptions.  The first strenght of the risk manager is his ability to do research or to access findings and applications from other studies.  This is reflected in the game, which allows the player to gain experience with several trials.  The more the practice the better the management of risks.  The other  aspect of risk management is protection.  The game exemplifies this in the ability to raise the island to create protection from damage.  This strategy is to be well thought out.  How much to invest in protection and when to invest in protection.  With the meter ticking, the player realised when to seek protection and under what conditions.  The researching facility should therefore contain several elements. The severity element gives the risk manager the option of choosing the protection and the extent to which he needs it. fFnally the chose of the insurance scheme.  Research again backs this decision.  Three schemes were available and the player makes an informed choice.<br /><br />The implications of playing the game a second time is that it allows for trial and error methodology to be used to arrive at the right decision about costs and benefits.   The costs include  building the development plans, maintaining them as well as protecting them.   The purchase of the insurance at different rates helps the player to  understand the art of balancing the costs.  The research details tells you the coverage which is actually needed.  The protection is designed at one level only.  Therefore the cost remain same.  But the time of application of this tool helps in understanding the costs involved.   The methodology used in calculating benefits helps in understanding the cost benefit analysis.  Another aspect is the  ability of completely rebuilding the develop plans.  The management of costs in rebuilding and repairing and recreating the development plans makes for the fulfillment of  the purpose of the game.<br /><br />If this game has to be redesigned.   One can include greater variation of the development of the area.  In reality when we visit risk affected sites.  We find structures which are of different value to the community.   We have seen schools and community complexes being so much more useful to the community compared to a home. Similarity common property resources are so valuable to the community compared to other structures.  These could be incorporated in the game.   There is variation in the insurance schemes.  There could have been different forms of protection.  Evacuation could be thought of as well as building alternatives.  The concept of reinforcing structures was excellent.  This to me was a great learning.     The upgradation of existing structures is an option that risk managers have to consider.  In the sites i have worked in we realise that alternate land is simply not available.  People have to rebuild.  The concept to reinforce existing resources is to me an excellent idea.   The gauge showing the position you are in at every level of the game is good so is the meter which shows the balance position between costs and benefits.</div>
