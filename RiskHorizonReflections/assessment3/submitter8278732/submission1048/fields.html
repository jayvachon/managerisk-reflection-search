    <h1>Submission 1048 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8278732, session_user_id: 0c50d18253bee128db59896d8c0c9cdbed34a29f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game was successful in pointing out the various facets of risk management (Knowledge, Protection, Insurance/ incentive, information, behaviour, resources). It was able to put us in the shoes of a benevolent ruler whose only job is to make decisions based on the information and the options available (although real life is probably not such). The only shortcoming in the game was the behaviour aspect, where despite incentive, knowledge and resources, many a time risk management management fails because of psychological and behavioural aspects. In the game however preparation for risk had an immediate affect when executed successfully. During the later stages it became a race against time which rightly points out the necessity to allocate resources efficiently in the previous stages so you have enough to get thorough in the later stages.<br /><br />I tried the game a couple of times (mostly because it was fun). After the first time, I tried different variation of more pods or upgrade pods. This is something that cannot be exercised in real life however, where you can see the best outcome. The learnings here is that resource allocation have to be efficient where it has to maintain a balance between development, protection, knowledge and insurance. The two principle resources here were time and money.<br /><br />I would put a facet where the citizens would not be inclined to follow the prescribed directions so readily. Here the state would have to spend time in advocacy to convince its people to say take up protection. (e.g. encouraging more condom use rather than issuing a directive for more condom use).<br /><br />Thanks</div>
