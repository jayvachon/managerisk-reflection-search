    <h1>Submission 2505 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7531349, session_user_id: dbeef5d9c99be178186b81c3673e7213ef003818)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the world
of Alora, risk management plays a vital role in maintaining the city’s
existence and growth. Comets are main threat to the city which constantly hit
and devastates the buildings. As the game player is given a certain amount of
time to develop the city to a certain level, I tried to avoid any destruction
caused by the comets, which could sends Alora to a very flat growth and leave
me too little time left to repair the city and reach target level of growth. In
order to keep the city thrive against the constant bombardment from the comets,
risk management is indispensable, which includes research activities, insurance
purchases, preparation activities for protection and coping activity. Research activities
help the player predict the comet’s chance of hit and severity level, which
allows the player to adjust the protection systems in advance to cope with the
hit. Buying insurance helps recover the repair costs and replace part of lost
development. However, as all activities such as research and protection cost money
and time, the player has to balance the fund for building and upgrading more
pods versus researching comets, buying insurance plan and protecting the city. It
is important to note that preparation for risk affect development of the city
in many ways. For example, doing research and buying insurance will reduce the
fund for building more pods, which may affect the city’s development after some
time. In the meanwhile, preparation activity like raising the land of Alora to
protect it from comets and waves not only costs money but time, which hindering
the growth of Alora city, thus affecting the development immediately.<br /></p><p>If I played the game only once, I realize I would play differently if I were to play it again. In the first time, I only focused on protecting the city and spent too much time and money on buying insurance and raising the land. Even though my land survived the comet’s severe bombardment and remained undamaged, I still failed the game as I didn’t grow the city to the target level. Thus, the core of this game is to keep balance among activities, which means the player shouldn’t just focus on building or protecting but both. Multi-tasking is the key to win this game.<br /></p>

<p>If I am tasked
with developing a new version of the game, I would make the risk more diverse
and put risk management in a different context other than just building and
upgrading the pods. The idea is similar to Hay Day game which is one of the
most popular games on App store. It attracts many players because it makes us
feel real while growing &amp; harvesting crops, making and selling products,
investing and expanding farm. So my idea of developing Alora is to make it more
real by turning Alora to a city which has land for crops like Hay Day but
adding risk factors into it. The risks can be diverse like natural risks (comet
bombardment, flood, drought) and voluntary risks (risk of failure from investment
in machinery and technology).</p></div>
