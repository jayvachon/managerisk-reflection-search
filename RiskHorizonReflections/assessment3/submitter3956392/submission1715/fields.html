    <h1>Submission 1715 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3956392, session_user_id: 8b6f47bcc70853f99b534de2ad94487786cc7d47)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of the risk management in the game was to establish the community such that it is free from any damages from comets. <br />It was really a very hard task to find a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance. The trade-offs that I faced was either to protect people from the damage or to insure people from the damage. I had find the research being the most beneficiary and had helped to maintain the cost on the damages. Since every activity had cost so I was really difficult to either upgrade the house or insure the house. The up-gradation of house and protecting the house surely had an affect but only for some time. The protection and damages (if any) needs to be checked regularly. <br />After playing it again and again I have realized that research was the key thing but the only thing. Every activity need synchronization. Protection and the up-gradation was required regularly. The least importance I had given was to the insurance and the only reason was the cost of it. <br />The main thing that I had learned was that in real risk management requires lot of expertise and knowledge. But that also gets failed because of uncertainties. In the game if was real hard to predict theÂ  effect of comet if not enough research is done. Everything needs planning, without it risk management is zilch. <br />If I am tasked with developing the game then I will provide better scope for community involvement. So I would like to add a button for community awareness support. <br />The place where I live have very bad drainage system. Lot of research and proposals has been done by the government officials and by the private actors, but nothing has been implemented. Hence I would suggest to implement the proposals in the best planned way.<br /><br /></div>
