    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is its clarity. You provided a clear summary of the game and its limits, in addition to the actions you took while playing it, and potential changes you would make to the game.  One way to improve your reflection: expand on the trade-offs (between insurance, knowledge, and protection), for example, what helped you make your "judgement calls" on whether to buy insurance or not. Overall this was a very good reflection! </div>
