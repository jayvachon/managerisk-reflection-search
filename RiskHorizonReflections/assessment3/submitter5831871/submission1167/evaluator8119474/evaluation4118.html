    <div class="field-value">I believe that the key strength of this reflection is that the Student understood that the Game required a non-conservative approach and adjusted its behaviour accordingly and in a way that would contravene its nature (the Student himself/herself is described as conservative and to change one's m.o. is never easy and should be praised). One thing that is not mentioned on the analysis the role that protection - further to insurance - can play and it is not clear whether the Student used such resource and part of the risk prevention procedure. If it was used, some reference to it would definitively strenghten this reflection.</div>
