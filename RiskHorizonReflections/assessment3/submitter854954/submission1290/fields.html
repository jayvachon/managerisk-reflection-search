    <h1>Submission 1290 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 854954, session_user_id: b8336d1e001f55b411aa2412129ee11adbfb4dfc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Lectures for the last two
weeks provide the path to development which is paid with both risks and
opportunities. In order to develop and seize opportunities it is necessary to
confront and even take risks. In fact as they go about their daily lives,
people face not one, but many types of risks. Some of it hits specific
individuals such as the risk of unemployment, crime or disease, while others
such as natural disasters and financial crisis are systemic and cut across
groups of people. People often don’t have the resources or ability however to
confront the risks they face. There may be burdened with obstacles and
constraints. Some of them are related to lack of knowledge and information, to
lack of resources or financial constraints, while others are the result of lack
of access to markets and public services.  </p><p><span>Although people face different types of risk, a common risk
management concept can be applied.  According
to the lecture 2.2, there are four main interlinked components of any risk
management:</span></p><p><span>·         </span>Knowledge: To understand
shocks, internal and external conditions and potential outcomes, thus reducing
uncertainty.</p><p><span>·         </span>Protection: To reduce the
probability and size of losses and increase those benefits</p><p><span>·         </span>Insurance: To transfer
resources across people and over time, from good to bad states of nature</p><p><span>·         </span>Coping: to recover from losses
and make the most of benefits.</p><p><span>Risk Horizon game provides for experience to manage risk
of natural disaster when comets hit the earth which destroys my community. In the game, knowledge is the first
and foremost component that I have to know, when a comet is coming, about its severity, chance to hit and level of damage, and at the same times I have
to know what to do to build the community. When I know about
risks, I can protect my pods by raising the level of my community in order to
reduce the severity if the comet hit the earth.  As I have limited capacity,
protection is not always the best solution. I therefore need insurance to
cover my bad times of damages.  Whenever
the comet hits the earth, I have to cope with it to recover from the losses by
connecting within the community quickly and repair the damages as soon as
possible.</span></p><p>To play well in the game I need to think about the balance between
protection (preparing for risk) and investing in building my community pods and insurance. And if any hit, coping with impacts of the risk
(connecting with other within community) is necessary. For example, when I first
played I put too much emphasis on insurance, and could not easily move from
level 1. Then I realized it is not enough to rely on insurance after the fact.
I also need to invest heavily in protection. I still could not move from level
2 and I finally learned that I did not cope with the impact of the risk well. I
started connecting within community and repair the pods as soon as the comet
hit the earth. I could move to the next levels with this. </p><p>















</p><p><span>My
lesson learned from the game is that I keep the balance between risk
preparation and development of my community. If I spend too much on building
and upgrading pods, I will be exposed to comets when they hit. On the other
hand, if I spend too much on protection, I will not have enough money to
develop my community sufficiently. This is a balance policy makers have to
consider all the time in spending limited resources on risk management or on other development priorities. </span></p></div>
