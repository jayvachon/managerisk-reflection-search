    <h1>Submission 1531 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8253062, session_user_id: 5a92ee1b336fb6d675abcd1951d52f83ae5c5036)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk Horizon is about developing your community while
managing the risks posed by comets. In this game, I have learned to use my
resources wisely. These resources are the knowledge I've learned, the pods, the
money, and my time. </p><p>After trying out the tutorial several times, I was able
to assess the game environment. On my assessment, I was able to identify my
strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. I was able to identify the
factors that must be addressed should the comets appear.  I was also able to recognize my resources like
the pods that create revenue/money which could be used for future pod upgrade
or for the community’s protection or insurance. Time is also a valuable factor in
this game since its limited for each level.</p><p>During the game, I started to build pods within my budget.
I also made sure that there will be enough money left for emergency. But while
waiting for the completion of the pods construction, I managed to elevate the
ground for protection. This way, I was able to multi-task while waiting for the
comets to appear. </p><p>When comets started appearing, I always see to it that each
comets profile will be assessed. Assessing each comet gave me knowledge on how
to manage the development of the pods while managing the risks that comes along
with the comets impact. I used different strategy for each comet that I had
encountered with reference to current status of my resources. With this in
mind, I was able to allocate more of my time to research on comets that has a
high severity level and chances of hitting. And while researching on comets, I
always see to it that the pods are either being upgraded or being fixed (if
needed) to save more game time. This is how I utilize the key components of
risk management all at the same time.</p><p>Strategies vary in each scenario. Each scenario is
different from another. A comet that has a high severity level and chances of
hitting should be prioritized than those that have a low probability of damage
effect. Scenarios where multiple comets with high severity level and chances of
hitting appear should be dealt with caution. This is the best time to take
advantage of the insurance since the probability of damage is very high. This
is also applicable when there is scarcity on resources like money and
protection, or even game time.</p><p>









</p><p>Proper management of resources is essential for risk
management. These resources aren’t just the tangible things that we normally
have in mind. Knowledge and time are also important factors in risk management. Proper utilization of these resources makes risk management more efficient.</p></div>
