    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the clarity and structure of the writing itself. To make this reflection better the author should have (1) applied, described, and explicated the concepts and processes of risk management in more detail (making better use of and building upon the knowledge provided by the course's core resources) and (2) described less what he/she actually did in the game and instead reflected more on the personal learning itself.</div>
