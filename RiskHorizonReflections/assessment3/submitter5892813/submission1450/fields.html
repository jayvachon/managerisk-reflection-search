    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b></b><span><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></span></p><p><span>Risk management can be a powerful
instrument for<b> </b>development </span>whether risks are systemic or idiosyncratic,
imposed or taken on voluntarily, development can occur only by successfully
confronting risk and pursuing opportunity.  <b><br /></b></p>

<p><b><span>Reflection on the game:<br /></span></b></p><b>The role of risk management in the game measures </b>Put in place mitigation measures in the event
disaster strikes, Have resources that will enable developers
invest in knowledge acquisition to help us better understand potential risks, To better measure the probability of risks, To invest in protection activities to
safeguard communities 

<p><b>Choices made and the trade-offs confronted</b></p><p><b> Knowledge: </b>I cautiously
invested in research as I thought I needed some of these resources to improve
the pods as and when comets hit and caused minimal damage<b>.Protection:</b> Risk is inherently
characterized by uncertainty. This makes it difficult to know—for
certain—whether a risk management intervention will ultimately prove
worthwhile.<b> Insurance:</b>
This is critical in the event disasters hit although the costs are very high
and we feel that resources paid for such covers would have been invested in
developing our communities. I had to sacrifice development to have resources
saved to pay for insurance to protect the few development I attempted to
develop.</p>

<p><b>The effect of Risk Management/preparation
on potential development;</b>Before any developments, large
shocks that are very likely to occur require adequate preparation to make it
worthwhile investing in these developments. The more likely a disaster was
likely to occur the more resources had to be reserved for research and building
more protection for the pods. This constrained the development of more pods
which would otherwise have been beneficial to the community.After developments it
required even more resources for potential risks that had not been envisaged.
This meant that in some cases due to inadequate preparation the Pods were
exposed greatly to potential damage and in many cases the community, though
with many pods they were destroyed or damaged due to inadequate preparation for
potential risks.</p>

<p><b>LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE GAME</b></p>

<p>If I had to play the game more than once, I would minimize my
developments and have sufficient resources to insure the few developments I
have made.I would also pursue the
above strategy in addition to carrying out sufficient research to ensure that I
improve my knowledge on potential disasters. That way I would be prepared
adequately to salvage my developments.By contrast,
low-probability high-impact events required less costs for insurance.I also noticed that in
some cases I spent a lot of resources in research and insurance and yet when
the impacts were experienced I noted that I had probably over invested to cover
my pods whose damage was minimal. I guess I was too risk averse.</p>

<p><b>Progress recognized the more I played the game:</b>I did quite a few things differently
after the first time I played the game for example I invested a lot in research
to gain more knowledge in potential occurrence of comets.I also invested more in
insurance to reduce the impact of comets </p>

<p><b>The main things I learned from the game:</b>Investing in research to
equips us with sufficient knowledge is costly however the cost of not investing
in research on potential risks is even greater.If you spend too much on
building and upgrading pods, you are exposed to comets when they hit development should not constrain research to mitigate risks.The more protection you
provide your pods the less impact you are exposed to when comets hit.Insurance is a vital risk
management tool. Without it developers are at high risk of losing the entire
investment</p>

<p><b>PROPOSED ADDITIONS TO BETTER REPRESENT THE RISK MANAGEMENT CHOICES THAT
MATTER</b><b>:</b>I would add in varying
risks with differing magnitudes so that players are able to choose which risk
to prioritize.I would also create a
scenario where players have to have some reserve resources for contingencies to
enable them to confront new or disasters that are not common in the game or a
given area.</p><strong>References:</strong><br />The game-Risk horizon<br />The World Development Report 2014<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
