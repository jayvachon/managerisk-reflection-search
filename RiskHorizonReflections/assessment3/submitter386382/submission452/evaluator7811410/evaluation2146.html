    <div class="field-value">I am very sorry you did not participate in the activity because of your dislike for computer games. You could have at least made an attempt since that is what learning is all about; it is about breaking new grounds and involving in new experiences. Students and Facilitators alike posted several tips on the discussion boards to assist people who had difficulties with the assignment. And instead of posting this rather unfortunate comment, you could have presented your argument in a more responsible way. I sincerely hope you inculcate the ability to take on new and unusual challenges in life and also learn to be more courteous in your civil relations. </div>
