    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The game taught me the importance of using the available resources at the adequate circunstance. It was clear that the three tools had different results as we evolved in the game. </div><div>First of all, I noticed the importance of insurance. In an initial phase of the investment it is really important to garantee that the return will be safe and will not be threatened by high damages. Besides that, my main strategy in level 1 was to build as much pods as I could.</div><div>In level 2, I gave priority to insurance as well and then I tried to improve my pods keeping them all at the same level, instead of improving only one. Protection did not seemed to be that important until this stage.<br />Regarding level 3, I manage to improve my pods and kept them, once again, at the same level.</div><div>I believe I’ve lost the game at the forth level because I did not use enought protection. Firstly, the damages for each individual shock increased substancially. Secondly, the repairment of the pods was too slow for the number of occurences. As a result I was still finishing the recovery from one shock when the next one occured. Besides that, the insurance seemed to be less efective in this stage, in which I used little protection. There might be a correlation between these two factors.</div><div>As for the information about the comets, it did not seemed that relevant to me. That is also a possible reason for me to have lost at level 4.</div><div><br /></div></div>
