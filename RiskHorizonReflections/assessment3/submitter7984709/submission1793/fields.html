    <h1>Submission 1793 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7984709, session_user_id: be02d26283e25bba276a9b8d8c8b42af47eed737)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>It seemed that protection had minor
effects on controlling or prohibiting the shocks. On the contrary, knowledge
had an incremental effect minimizing the impacts probability. I started first
round by focusing on protection and the outcome was more impact. This brought
me to the understanding that high level protection cannot guarantee less shock
as it has no effect on reducing the chance of impact.</p>

<p>Then I diverted attention on
insurance which seemed to bring more confidence especially after the attacks,
but again there was no control over the impact and it was just like spending
unlimited amount of budget just to alleviate the pain after the shock. </p>

<p>It was in the next rounds that I
experienced the power of knowledge. The more I researched about the nature of
the comets; I could better confront the impact of comet. The number of impacts
and the consequences of shock reduced as a result of paying more attention to
the knowledge around the natural events.</p>

<p>This also showed that preparation
for risk was possible through a series of actions that should be taken through
the process of risk management. Immediate reaction did not reduce the risk of
impact, because there was no plan behind immediate reaction and it was just an
unplanned response to the disasters I was facing.</p>

<p>If I was supposed to play the game
again, research was the first action I would start with, and then I would put a
lot of energy on communication, as I found communication a productive way of
sharing the knowledge that was useful in minimizing the impact of disaster. Knowledge
sharing and contribution are main instruments after we face shock every time.</p>

<p>What the place I live in suffers
from is lack of a leadership in risk management when facing a shock. Risk
management process is not very well orchestrated and resources are not allocated
properly. I personally believe that risk must be managed like a project,
meaning that, it must have an owner who is responsible and makes decisions and
instructs all available resources in order to make the risk a success,
minimizes loss and puts the team in place of opportunity. Next very important
aspect of risk management is the lessons learned from every case. This can help
better manage any similar future shocks, reduces the level of risk and reduces
any future cost may incur from similar accidents. Thus I would not add anything
to the game if I was tasked to develop a new version, instead I will put more
attempt to leading and lessons I can learn from the game. </p>
