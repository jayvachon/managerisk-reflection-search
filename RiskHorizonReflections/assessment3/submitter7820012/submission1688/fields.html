    <h1>Submission 1688 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7820012, session_user_id: e20b28cbdf4c72710842f3375b62258fb57e40e9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the Risk Horizon game was primarily to increase the resilience of the world of Alora to negative shocks, which took the form of constantly recurring cometary impacts of different degrees of severity and different propabilities of impact (both of which again could be estimated by virtue of research). In other words, the role of risk management here was to decrease the damage to Alora’s development that a cometary impact could potentially have, thus safeguarding not only the process of development and progress but ultimately the survival of Alora itself. Risk management was intended here to either protect Alora’s development entirely from the damage caused by a cometary attack or at least help it prepare for and cope more easily (that is, quickly and cost-effective) with the damages caused by the cometary impact so that Alora could recover quickly and cost-effectively from the negative shocks of a cometary impact and develop its society further. Following the logic of a virtuous circle, the more cost-effective the recovery (if any recovery was necessary at all), the more resources were available to invest both in further protective measures against future cometary impacts (thus indirectly safeguarding the development and survival of Alora) as well as in further direct societal development. There was a constant trade-off between allocating resources to direct development or allocating resources to instruments of risk management instead. While the priority was the development and survival of Alora, such development was only possible by protecting the community from and preparing the community for the repercussions of the cometary impacts. Another trade-off was between the various actions of preparation (ex ante risk management). The challenge was to balance appropriately between gaining knowledge (about the estimated severity and probability of actual impact) by virtue of research, protecting the community of Alora by raising the platform upon which the community was built (thus lowering the probability and size of a potential damage), and insuring the community from potential damages caused by the cometary impacts (by purchasing an insurance now to make a potentially necessary recovery less expensive in the future). Preparation for risk affected development at all times – while in the short-term resources potentially available for development were invested in risk management measures instead, in the long-term such investments proved not only to be highly cost-effective but to ultimately safeguard the further development and survival of Alora.

With each restart of the game I learned to better balance my allocation of resources between (1) risk management (indirect development) or direct development as well as between (2) research, protection, and insurance. Most importantly, I learned that research (even if its results are merely estimations rather than certainties) is a necessary prerequisite for more informed decisions about how to allocate your limited resources.

Living close to a river within an area that has become increasingly prone to floods, to better represent the risk management choices that my community faces I would change the initial negative shock in the Risk Horizon game from cometary impacts to rainfall.  </div>
