Well, firstly, there is no luck in the game since every proper decision making about the right trade offs to make is available to you: You had a choice of either concentrating on research, protection or insurance.
Although the game reflection is not properly communicated especially say to someone who at a glance would want to see. 
In one of your lines, you mentioned an avoidance of insurance. Pls note that no element of risk mitigating factor should be avoided, as such may result to a coping that will cost ten times higher than preparation. When the probability of a comet hit with severe consequence is irreversible, it becomes non-negotiable to seek insurance in order to ameliorate resultant effect.  Just ensure a striking balance between protection and being knowledgeable about a risk and seek insurance. This will help a great deal, minding time and resource.</div>
