    <h1>Submission 269 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3623262, session_user_id: 98970e7eefb9cc951cd3eeb69c91245cd43e11c2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management was important and selective use was also helpful.   During the first couple of times I played I depended only on insurance and it would get me to the 2nd level but not beyond.  In subsequent games I used protection and research more consistently to minimized cost and maximize investment in the growth of my village.   In the end I avoided insurance and had an unexpected disaster that I could not recover from at level five.   Paying attention to all three mitigating factors were important.    <br /><br />Tradeoffs -  when I invested in protection it took time away and and dollars but the protection was a good investment.  Insurance was expensive but still took time and money to repair when protection avoided the damage.   Keeping my eye on the comets coming in guided the level of protection I needed.  The disaster that took me by surprise was the one that destroyed the town.  Even with knowledge some disasters exceed expectations and insurance would be needed.<br /><br />Playing more than once demonstrated that experience did help.  I consistently would improve from game to game.   But also there seemed to be a luck factor involved as well.   <br /><br />To improve the game it would be good to have some more dials displaying the total value of the development.  How it grew in value -  what investments reflected high growth potential, which reflected slow and steady growth.  Which structures were immune to the disasters and which were not.  etc.   This was a fun and interesting game as it is but always more complexity and information will expand the potential for learning.<br /></div>
