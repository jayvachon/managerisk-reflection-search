    <div class="field-value">Key strength of this reflection is in the overall clarity that the author has shown viz a viz insurance as far as risk management is concerned. The author notes the role of research in determining the resources one invests in insurance. If the risk is minimal as determined after research, there is no point in taking costly insurance for higher protection.

One thing that could have made this reflection better would be- authors mention of the role of raising the level of the community in prevention of risks.</div>
