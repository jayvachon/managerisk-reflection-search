    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">First of all, I would like to say thank you for the team in organizing this course which tries to address the main objective in such interesting and much more interactive game like this.<br /><br />The Role was balancing risk preparation and healthy development. As resources were limited initially, I chose to research the horizon for its severity level while buying insurance which is initially less costly. This helps to monitor the comet's shock level and act for more building protection to prevent the pods then. The preparation affects the development after sometime as the resources were under constraint. <br /><br />From the process, I learnt to give attention to the research the severity of each comets and tried to get insurance and protection. If I could be able to play more than once, then I need to wait to build the protection a few times before the comet hit he ocean or just do not protect for safe Comets. I learnt that during this waiting time, we would be able to acquire resources that we would do the protect cost effective with large area of coverage. <br /><br />A better researching tool to develop, i.e. historical data to record. As time buys resources and the costs are increased over time. The research tools are important. </div>
