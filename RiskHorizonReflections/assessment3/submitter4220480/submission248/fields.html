    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.<br />I thought this game wanted to tell us the difficulty of risk management.<br />Limited money. If we had lots of money, it will be easy game for us.<br />Limited time. If we had plenty of time to think about, it will be easy to play.<br /><br />2.<br />I played several times, maybe 7 or 8 times. I always lost at level 5.<br />I thought many things. Balance is important?  Protection is the most important? Luck is also important.<br />But, I couldn't find the answer. And I think there is no right answer.<br /><br />3.<br />If I was asked to develop this game, <br />I want to add more message or hint for result page.<br />I want to stress what is the key message for this game and for real life. <br /><br /></div>
