    <h1>Submission 1481 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8142543, session_user_id: 5d92c8c6baac33db4b034757257c7a8e86c5ff93)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hi all,<br /><br />In my opinion the main point of the Risk Horizon game was the importance of insurance. First time i played the game, i just wanted to develop, so the money that i give to insurance was too much and i just bought level 1 insurance.. But after the meteors that hit, i run out of money to repair my pods.<br /><br />In my second try i also gave my attention to the insurance and development both. And in all hits, i saved a lot. So basicly, i got that insurance is one of the key points of developing. Because sometimes it doesn't matter how you are protected, (As meteors (: ) you have to be hit, but if you have the insurance it will be easier for you to return your past life before the shock.<br /></div>
