    <h1>Submission 1459 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1460709, session_user_id: f8f6f3d89a746aeafe201f84edb82b3d83e48d23)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1)      </span><span>In this game the role of risk
management was how I would allocate my resources: the time and the money.
According to the information I had about every comet and especially about the
probabilities of hitting and the impact of crashing, I ought to decide if I
would spend my resources on the development, the protection or the insurance.
On the first couple of levels, emphasis was given to the development and the
achievement of a decent level of protection (3-4 grades). The preparation for
the risks did affect the development. Most of the time was consumed for
research and protection improvement. This time part was increasing in every
higher level.    </span></p>

<p><span>2)      </span>I played the game many times. First
of all I had to understand its reasoning well and then to adapt my strategy
accordingly. What I did different comparing to the first times? On the first
times I tried to explore the probabilities of hitting and its impact. On my
last effort I had a specific strategy of risk and resources strategy and with
some more luck than on previous times, I reached level 5. What I learned was
that I should be quick on getting and estimating any information but also on
deciding between alternatives. Risk is everywhere in our lives and we should
not underestimate it.</p>

<p><span>3)      </span><span>My place where I live has been hit
harshly by the economic crisis. Therefore, in the game I would add a factor of
financial instability. Every pod would need different time and resources to get
developed. Consequently, it would contribute different amount of income to the
community. Consequently, after a comet hit, each pod would have different
priority to be fixed again. This would represent better the fact that in times
of economic crisis and instability, some domains are more important than others
and most of the limited available resources would be spent to them.</span></p></div>
