    <div class="field-value">1.	Reflection
The role of risk management in the game was to provide protection in the event of possible loss. Also, it required a strategy, planning and implementing decisions so as to develop the village fully. In addition, risk management helps the community to grow while being cushioned against risks and if the risks occurred, then it would help in minimizing losses.  
To make a good decision, I had to consciously plan to monitor the environment, assess the risks and take corresponding action. After citing a comet, had to analyze possibility of occurrence and if it did occur, then what would the severity be. The speed at which I took actions to some extent contributed to whether I would be caught up and hit badly, lots of losses or I would be ready for any eventuality.
I also noted having immediate savings helped me to minimize damage. In addition, formal insurance helped me to rebuild destroyed pods and at a cheaper cost. 
It was necessary to balance all the aspects, as the severity in the comet increased, so did the damage if it hit the pods. As my risk increased, I also found it necessary to buy higher amount of insurance because savings alone would not help much.

As I prepared for risks, development slowed down but because I had to do research and also take protective actions. Later on it was easier to develop because I had taken necessary protection measures. I now had time and less worry about risks. This is because I was constantly aware of what eminent risk and potential losses and ways to mitigate as well as cope.

2. Learning
I learnt that it is important to carry out research constantly so that you can gauge the elements you are exposed to vis a vis potential damage in the event of occurrence and take the necessary decision on whether to protect or to insure. Saving was also important in reducing the damage. The higher the safer it is to, in addition to protection, transferring the risk through insurance. 

3. Any change
I would recommend protection not to be tied to raising the island only because each of the pods could equally be exposed to not only floods but also drought.
