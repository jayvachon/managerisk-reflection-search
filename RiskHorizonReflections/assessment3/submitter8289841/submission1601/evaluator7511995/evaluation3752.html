    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the writer did state what he has been through via the game.
He showed and gave examples of the three main tools: research, protection and insurance in the risk management. 
However, he should have put more efforts in giving his reflection: what have he learned via the game? And he didn't answer the second question about if he had had a chance to play the game again.
In the end, he just mentioned vaguely about the game should have been put more details in the research, however, which parts should have been put and how it could help the recovery/avoidance the comet? He didn't point out these points and therefore, his reflection is not clear to understand about what he has learned during the game.</div>
