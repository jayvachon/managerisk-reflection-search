    <h1>Submission 1763 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8291160, session_user_id: 153c58146a23058758b5bb7519246b1d8d51291c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I have played many video games in my life for
entertainment purpose after working and studying times since I was a kid. After
playing the Risk Horizon game, I realize that this is the most amazing game I
have known. </p>

<p>Risk Horizon game is a real time strategy game that
teaches how and why risk management is important for healthy development. In
the game, we will have to manage a society facing with shocks (comets) over the
times. To reach the goal of healthy development of community, we need to balance
between growing the society and prepare for the potential shocks. This becomes
the role of risk management in the game. During game, we have 3 power abilities
to help: Research, Protection and Insurance. With the Research Power, we could
learn the chance of comet hitting, the time until impact and the severity of
the comet. Protection power improves the protection level in the long term. By
purchasing the Insurance Power, it is quicker and cheaper to rebuild the
community after the comet shock. But there is a clear trade-off that we should
consider. Improving the powers will cost you resources.</p>

<p>I played the game two times. At the first time, I stopped
at level 3. I just focused on the development by using all the resources on
building community. And then, when a lot of shocks occurred at the same time, I
realized that it might be too late to protect or buy insurance. Therefore, I
restarted. At the second time, on one hand, I still concentrated on the
community development at the beginning, to receive more resources. On the other
hand, I developed a good Protection Power. I also purchased the Insurance when
there was the high probability of hitting comet occurred. In addition, when
protection and insurance could not stop the damage from comets, I improved the
Research system to have more time to connect the community, raising protection
level. And then, I obtained the level 5. From the game, I knew one important
thing that is protection the community is useful, but can get expensive. The
higher the community rises, the more expensive it becomes to raise its further.
Diminishing return is a fact of life here.</p>

<p>This is an amazing game with great features. Suppose I
could have a chance to join in developing a new version of the game, I would improve
the speed of wealth rising when we obtain the equal development. When playing,
I saw that there was no difference between inequality developments. 9
communities with the identical level (such as level 2) give the same speed with
1 community level 5 and 8 others level 1. I suggest a increase in speed of
wealth rising when all the communities reach the same level. Â </p>

<p>In the conclusion, Risk Horizon game is an amazing Risk
management game that I have known. I think I will keep playing this game to
improve point of view about Risk management.</p></div>
