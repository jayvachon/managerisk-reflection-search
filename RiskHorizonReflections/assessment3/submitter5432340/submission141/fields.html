    <h1>Submission 141 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5432340, session_user_id: ea21aee1396e940e6416e85eda2593c6673836d6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. What was
the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what
trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?
In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after
some time)?</p>

<p> Ans: The
community residing on the area was very much prone to the risks of comet
attack. Risk management was very important here in terms of protecting the
households, spreading the risk and buying necessary insurance. In case, the
insurance was not bought or the risk was not spread among the multiple households,
the risk would have damaged the region completely.</p>

<p>Here, if
we building multiple households became better to control damage as the risk was
spread.</p>

<p> The money
was limited and have to manage insurance fees, building &amp; upgradation
charges and speeding up of development. At level 1, I made choice of buying minimum
insurance and focussed on building households and saving money for repair work
during disaster. The time was less and I utilized the time when building houses
was going on to acquire knowledge on comets.</p>

<p> Preparation
of risk affects development as the resources are limited and those are to be
preserved for disaster.</p>

<p> </p>

<p> 2. If you
played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it
again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do
differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from
the game?</p>

<p> Ans: I played the
game more than once. Initially, I didn't utilize the resources properly. The
next time I focussed on preserving money for contingency during disaster,
focussed on building more houses initially and buying adequate insurance, not
less not more. I also focussed on acquiring knowledge on comets to utilize
time.</p>

<p> The main learning
of the game were timely resource management, contingency planning, spreading
risk among all the people of same interest group and gradual development
considering all the risks.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3 The game
captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are
tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or
add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the
risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</p>

<p> With respect to the new version of game, I would like to add
some social structures and cultures which are prevalent among the households.
In the game, the households were all similar and uniform, but in reality all
live with different thoughts, culture, religion and community. This variety in
households sometimes initiates the damage or sometimes become hurdle in
managing risk. Many households might not want to come to a common group for
managing the risk. In the online game, you can give task to the user to join
the community even if they don't want this. This can be done by providing some
common benefit to them. So, utilizing the resources for binding the households
together can be added in the game and in reality as well.</p></div>
