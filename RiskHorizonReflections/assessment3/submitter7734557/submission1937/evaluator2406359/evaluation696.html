    <div class="field-value">I think, the problem of your essay is too short, you're required to write an essay of 500-600 words so that you can express all your thoughts on this, but you answered all the questions with a two short paragraph that makes your essay unclear and lack of evidence. I understand your point to some extent, but it would be better if you answer one question only if you gonna write a short essay. Better luck next time my friend,
