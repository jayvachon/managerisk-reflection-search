    <div class="field-value">1) What is the key strength of this reflection?
R/ I really like your thinking! I generally agree about the approaches to the preparation of risk and its components. I want to highlight several important key ideas in the essay: 

a). Preparing for risk. Prepare for possible disruptions requires consideration of the relationship between costs and potential benefits once the risk has materialized. "(...) If the comet does not hit, then the opportunity cost is the time we spend on research to the development of our community. Each share will cost us precious resources!" 

b). Insurances. Definitely cost measures that aim to ensure, soothe and make it affordable for retrieval tasks of the various negative effects it brings the risk.

2) What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
R/ I would like a wider scope in the sense of raising the preparation for the "risk management". Be ready for risk, involves managing under uncertainty, part of the key is in the balanced coordination of viewed components (knowledge, protection and insurance). 

Be able to identify the potential impact of any risk, part of understand not only the degree of exposure to any perturbation (external factor), also part of being able to give a reading ability of endogenous conditions (internal factor), from this double look (outside vs inside) can generate possible causes of success in risk management and increase future capacity to recover from negative events, and synergies between effective protection and assurance.</div>
