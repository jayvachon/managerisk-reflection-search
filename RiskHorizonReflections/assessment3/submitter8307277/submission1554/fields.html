    <h1>Submission 1554 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307277, session_user_id: 3fcc4217fe04bacd8be1d5262d5afedb7e029398)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Risk management can be a powerful instrument for development.Risk is everywhere. While risks in some areas and </div><div>some regions have diminished in recent years—in part because of improved macroeconomic and financial management and better preventive health care in developing countries—people in developing and developed countries alike continue to face a multitude of risks.Failure to prevent and prepare for risk can have tragic consequences—often leading to widespread loss of life. Risk management help in preventing that consequences or atleast somewhat make us prepare for it . We read that in our RESOURCE material. <br /><br />In this game RISK MANAGEMENT was an important factor. The goal of our game was to fill the meter fast while protecting the pods from comets and at the same time doing research and providing insurance.We must create a balance between growing our community and preparing for these potential shocks.While protecting our land we have to let go of our meter so as to protect our selves from the upcoming comets. We have to take a RISK to protect our pods. In between doing so we have to carry out our research while insuring ourselves against the odds.By obtaining insurance, pods damaged from flooding will be quicker and cheaper to rebuild. Insurance also recovers lost development time after you your pods are repaired! Making multiple connections was a alternative of protecting ourselves after calamity has happened and we can achieve so by doing more and more research. If the comet does not hit, then the opportunity cost is the time that we spend on research than developing our community. Each action will cost us precious resources!<br /><br />I played the game more than once. Not making it in the first time I realised what mistakes I made in the first attempt. Either i emphasised more on insurance or spent much of my time on research. And then I realised I have to make a balance between all  three Luminator powers: Research, Protection, and Insurance.  If I spend too much on building and upgrading pods, I will be exposed to comets when they hit. When I sustain damage from comets my progress bar on the left is decreased. On the other hand, if I spend too much on preparation for risk, I will not have enough money to develop your community sufficiently to pass the level.This is a balance I have to consider all the time. I have limited resources, so there is a tension between spending up front on risk management (for shocks that may hit in the future, but may not hit) or to spend on other development priorities.<br /><br />I would propose better insurance policies , better research facilities and etc</div></div>
