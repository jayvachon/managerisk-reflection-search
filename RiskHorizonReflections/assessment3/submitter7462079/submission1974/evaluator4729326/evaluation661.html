    <div class="field-value">the key strength of this reflection is that the student has put his/her views into words very clearly. this shows that that the student has spent quite some time to play the game and learn from it too and he/she has clearly put forward his/her views. he/she surely has a better understanding of risk management now.
This reflection is very well written. He/she has very elaborately explained his/her experience of the game. But this reflection could have been better had he/she proposed something to be added to the game related to how to make the game more informative and enlightening. rather, he/she chose to focus on how to make the game more engrossing which was also a good suggestion.</div>
