    <h1>Submission 592 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5520434, session_user_id: 2221ba243ed8a6fee321df3e1de987512d20144c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) Issue of risk management was at the heart of the game, as bad management of meteor risks can cause a decrease in the total points and a slowing in the developing of the space village. Collecting knowledge about risk, which we can face in the future, is the first but main step for me. Because when we learn new information about the definition and effects of our risky position, also we can basically learn the ways of the protection from the risky position and learn clearly the ways and effects of the insurance, which is a kind of an ex post protection, on risk. I think that development is affected from the preparation for risk after some time.<br /><br />2) If I play this game again but only once, I will build more pots, which are crucial for investigation, collecting more money and passing to the new levels easily. If I play this game again more than once, I can most probably take more risks to going to the new levels with risky positions.The main issue, which I learned from Risk Horizon game, is the importance of effective risk management. A true risk management is not only important before the risky circumstances, but also sufficient after risky and worse situations.<br /><br />3) I might put more risky things with the meteors to development persons' visions. And more insurance levels or more insurance opportunities can be added to the game for its richness. People can more easily learn the division of risk with the new instruments.</div>
