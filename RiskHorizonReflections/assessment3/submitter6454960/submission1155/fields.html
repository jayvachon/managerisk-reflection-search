    <h1>Submission 1155 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6454960, session_user_id: 5282d6a9331b5aa1eecb4c6553aadbf8fd149efc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) This was an excellent game, with a clear progression ladder, with the intent for the player to use risk management tactics in the game experience. So the game mechanics was based on risk management aspects such as research, protection, insurance and opportunity, as lectured in the first few videos.  The choices were limited on wether to invest on the community development or in risk mitigation measures due to incoming meteors. Common trade-off were:<br /> - Research on meteors with low potential (impact or probability) would be traded-off for community development or protection.<br /> - Insurance purchase should be held back until doom was certain. I did not feel the need to take on higher risks because I had insurance.<br /> - The development bar had a neat color feature, which told me wether my growth rate was successful. I would often hold back developing protection until I had my growth rate nailed.<br /><br />Preparation for risk was necessary as a minimum 4-5 bars in the raise-o-meter for flood protection, and always do research on every meteor. Since research only cost 5 wealth, it was really worth it.  When a powerful meteor would approach, insurance would be a must. Preparation however, especially in the form of protection, would pay off most when it was done in advance - as if it were made for the future generations.  When my growth rate was right, or the goal had been achieved and time was still available, all that I had left went on to protection for the next level. So in short, preparation for risk affected development after some time.<br /><br />2) I played the game several times and beat level 6. My first loss was due to timer, I didn't develop my community fast enough, since I was spending too much time and money in protection. I learned to balance that more in the following attempts. Main things I learned from the game were:<br /> - Fast meteors with high potential are rare and very unlucky - some games may not even see them.<br /> - Get your growth rate right, then protect. In other words, meet your goal as fast as possible, then prepare for the future generations.<br /> - Assumptions can be dangerous, some meteors had 6 or 7 bars, but after more research, they could go to 9 or 10! So research was a priority in these situations.<br /> <br />3) The role of insurance didn't quite represent the lecture's intent. In the game it was designed more as a 'get out of jail card', in which I could use to quickly/cheaply recoup form a disaster (coping?).  Per lectures, it should have been a tool to enable me to take in more risk - as if planting a different, more sensitive and profitable crop would.  I'd re-design the insurance feature to reflect that, maybe by having to always pay a mandatory portion of it, then an optional escalating premium.  Also, the community inter-connecting portion needs some serious skill! I use a finger pad, so I think it would've been more advantageous to use a mouse. I'd also use different, alternating mini-games to represent this inter-connectiveness, the same one over and over again got a little boring. Finally, I'd also add a feature which would compare my game performance to other players across the world, to see where my risk management awesomeness fit when compared to others, segregated by location, social class, age, or gender for example.  May make for an interesting research topic in the future.<br /><br />Finally, use proper astronomical terminology - a meteor is different than a comet. No sweat world bank, I take you don't hire too many astrophysicists.</div>
