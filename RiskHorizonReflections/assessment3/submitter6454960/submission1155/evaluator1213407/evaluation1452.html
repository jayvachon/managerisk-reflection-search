    <div class="field-value">This reflection paper was a particularly strong piece. The author has clearly reflected on the experience of playing the game and has even got to the point of stressing some "relative" incongruence between the course content and some specific game features. Overall, the clear syntax and the quality of the ideas expresses make this reflection a very convincing one. In terms of possible areas for improvement, I would avoid an excessively colloquial tone at the very end of the text as that might be frowned upon by some reviewers (the more conservative and mature ones.  Striking balance between humor and tact (paired with humility) is always advisable. Good luck with your final project and the successful completion of this course!</div>
