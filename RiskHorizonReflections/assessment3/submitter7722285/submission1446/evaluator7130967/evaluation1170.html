The reflection clearly outlines the authors understanding of the technical areas of risk management from the course work. It provides a thoughts and insights into the process of playing Risk Horizon and the measures taken to achieve a positive result. The authors learning is demonstrated by the examples of changes made to strategy from lessons learned. Finally, the recommendation is a practical example based on actual conditions, something that demonstrates the transition of learning from technical to practical adaption. A well written piece.

A Bit Better
As a reflection, the authors has covered the requirements of the task. Improvement suggestions would only be peripheral additions. Perhaps a short sentence or two about how thoughts moved to feelings, as the task is a reflection, for example was there surprise or shock when the game was played?. The content, style and explanation of the piece serve as a excellent example of learning and application of knowledge. Again, well done.</div>
