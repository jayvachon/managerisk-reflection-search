    <div class="field-value">Reading the essay on the game reflection was a pleasure and I would like to thank the author. Although I do not share number of the authors views (strategy, time for decision making, addition to the game) it was nice to read properly explained view point with offered arguments for same.
It is obvious that author have put significant effort and thought in preparing the reflection and more importantly linking the game experience with learning objectives.</div>
