    <div class="field-value">The answer which given was very clear on what happen in the game, which strategies that should be implement and what the thing that he/she have studied from the game. I agree with the last answer that " addition of three status bars to represent the three mechanisms of risk management" This would improve the game by teaching the player to balance the bars in order to achieve a green development bar result. It will help the player get more clear idea about the element of risk management and get more understand about how ti manage the risk. </div>
