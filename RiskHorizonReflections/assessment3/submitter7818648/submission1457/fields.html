    <h1>Submission 1457 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7818648, session_user_id: 48d35766ca1e9dda42bbe8f74ae3fb2bd2e93433)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management in the game was to maximise the gains of development while minimising the effects of the risks in play. With limited resources and time, opportunity costs had to be weighed against the dangers inherent in the game world. Being too cautious was soon discovered to be a risk in and of itself, as limited resources could not be replenished in time to repair the inevitable damage caused by the comets. Being too reckless however meant that in the time spent attempting extensive developments, the cost of ignoring the meteors exposed you to catastrophic losses without community connections and resources to pull together despite the lack of formal insurance.</div><div><br /></div><div>The game effectively reinforced the inevitability of disaster, and the necessity of having and honing a strategy and a plan to deal with it in advance. The possibility of a community to thrive and develop in the midst of great risks was surprising, and the choice to concentrate on only one form of risk reduction turned out to be a risk in and of itself. Utilising multiple risk management strategies was found to be the best and only way to effectively develop a flourishing community with risk resilience to weather future storms. A raised profile, cash in the bank and developed infrastructure was the best way to effectively ensure that in the future, insurance could be purchased as and when a large hit came, small hits could be survived without any further expenditure, and time spent raising the land in advance of a comet hit could them be better spent learning about its dangers and the probability of damage, in order to study the phenomenon and spend time creating effective community strategies and connections when the inevitable happened.</div><div><br /></div><div>After playing the game a few times, I began to realise the possibilities of alternatives to insurance, the obvious and immediate risk aversion mechanism with which I am familiar. Research and building community connections were found to make an appreciable difference to minimise the impact of and pinpoint meteor risks, and could be a real and tangible non-financial asset for support and repair in the event of large and inevitable disasters. I learned to question the ignorant assumption that research is optional or wasteful. I also found that implementing protective mechanisms by raising the land was time consuming but worthwhile up to a certain point, after which it impeded the ability to develop and build, and to research, as no functions could be engaged in simultaneously. I learned additionally to develop smaller buildings quickly and larger buildings conservatively based on the projected impact of meteors, to avoid loss of completed productive developments through mismanagement and ambition. Furthermore, I learned to keep some money in reserve for last minute insurance for high-level unavoidable risks arising for which I could not adequately prepare, and for future developments in the next levels. Most of all I grew to understand that to keep a small and conservative society completely safe would rob it of the opportunity to develop to the next stage, trapping it in a cycle of fear, misunderstanding the possibilities presented by known and managed risks. </div><div><br />I would suggest the addition of three status bars to represent the three mechanisms of risk management. This would improve the game by teaching the player to balance the bars in order to achieve a green development bar result, and to remind them of their equal importance, and the opportunity costs presented by favouring mechanisms. Balance and proactivity is the key to success in this game and to managing the real challenges it presents.</div></div>
