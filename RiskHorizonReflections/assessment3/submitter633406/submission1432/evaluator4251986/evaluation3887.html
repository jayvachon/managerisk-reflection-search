    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the player has learned through the game that information is the key element in risk prevention. The student is also applying the knowledge s/he has learned from the game by applying it in real life, reflecting on the floods that happened in England. A very good and concise answer, I learned from this response more than from the game itself.</div>
