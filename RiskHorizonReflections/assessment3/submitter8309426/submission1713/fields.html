    <h1>Submission 1713 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8309426, session_user_id: 581423184eeb79834c4824b56a9ada2243a7c3ed)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game was to reduce the likelihood
and impact of damage caused by comets to enable development of the community to
take place at an adequate pace. </p>

<p>Initially, I tried to balance investments in the three
preparation functions available in the game:</p>

<p>1.      
Insurance, which allowed the use of funds during
good times to reduce the financial burden of repairing the community following
a comet impact later on</p>

<p>2.      
Protection, by raising the land, to reduce the
likelihood and impact of damage caused by a comet strike</p>

<p>3.      
And research, to increase knowledge of the risk
faced, which also allowed me to better judge whether to invest in, for example,
in further protection or in development of the city</p>

<p>A number of trade-offs were possible, for example, neglecting
protection (raising the land) because of the high cost involved, but taking out
insurance policies which would cover a high proportion of the costs of rebuilding
in the event of damage. In my case, I found that heavy investment in research
was effective, because this also allowed time to create community connections,
which was also a protective measure. However, research was quite time
consuming, which meant I was less able to spend time raising the land
(protection) and developing and building the pods. </p>

<p>In my game, raising the land and research (including
creating community connections) both appeared to have short-term payoffs, by
increasing my knowledge of the potential risk (allowing me to choose where to
make investments) and by reducing the impact of comet strikes. However, it’s
not possible to say how effective they were, as it’s not possible to know how
much damage would have been caused in the absence of these measures – at least
not without playing the game a second time. This demonstrates the difficulty of
uncertainty in decision making and also the political difficulty in taking
preparation measures, which may be costly and have benefits which are less
visible, as their success is demonstrated through an impact not happening (or
being less severe). </p>

<p>I played the game only once. In the end, the biggest
trade-off I made (and the reason that I only made it as far as level 5), was not
between different preparation measures, but choosing to invest heavily in
research, which reduced the time and resources available for the development
and construction of pods. The community did not develop quickly enough in level
5. This was a demonstration that my approach was perhaps too risk-averse;
instead of taking the opportunity to develop the community with excess funds, I
continued to undertake activities to prepared for comet strikes – even though the
community did not suffer any damage until level 5. </p>

<p>If I were to change one thing, it would be to make less
developed pods more vulnerable to a comet strike. This would more realistically
demonstrate the higher vulnerability of those with less
power/resource/knowledge etc. and the ability of those with greater resources
to be more able to withstand disasters and continue to prosper in the face of
adversity. </p></div>
