    <div class="field-value">- The key strength of this reflection is understanding the complexity of the risk management decisions when it comes to balancing between preparation to risk, coping with the damages and development (balance between knowledge, protection, insurance and community development in the game).
- I think a better description of the role of risk management in the game would have much contributed to this reflection.</div>
