    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management was prevent damage to the pods. If a shocks happened then a wave could cause some damage to the planet. Sometimes was necessary increase protection in order to avoid great damages, in others it was fine do research watching the comets while upgrading the pods to increase development. I always got the insurance, but only the lower one. If I could increase mu protection, the lower insurance was fine, because the damages were small. The second time I played, I got the middle insurance on 5th level, but it wasn't necessary at all. If the comet had a higher deverity I increased the protection, but sometimes even with high chance of hitting, it didn't occour, so I lost time and money to do develpment, but if the hit happend, it was good to have protection and insurance.</div><div><br /></div><div>Sometimes it is good do upgrade on pods than increase the protection to increase the level of development, but only when you know that the risk of impact is very low, to do that, you have to reasearch the comets, research your risk to know what to do with available time. Sometimes you can wait more time than others to take action, sometimes the response needs to be faster than others, and sometimes the damage is inevitable, but if you know what to do, you can decrease the damage.<br /><br />In a new version of the game would be interesting have different kinds of protection. The only protection was raise the entire ground, but what happened if we could build the pods in other places? The geography matters in real life. We could build the pods in the ocean in platforms or create some kind of barrier.<br /></div><div><br /></div></div>
