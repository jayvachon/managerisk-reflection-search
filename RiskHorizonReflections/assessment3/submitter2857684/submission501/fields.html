    <h1>Submission 501 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2857684, session_user_id: 4b47a4c9b791b3a9d7bc112f5c87ef613b352c0a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. In the game, risk management is the key. You always have to balance between healthy development and risk preparations, since they both consumes resources. When you have the resources, you would want to keep building the community in order to reach the milestone of development. Also, you would want to research the comet, improve the protection and buy insurance for your community with resources you have. Those two are the main trade-off in this game. Furthermore, to reduce the loss caused by comets shock, you also have to balance among different risk preparation methods. The Protection would ready you for the shock in the long run. The insurance would reduce your loss largely after a comet shock. The research would help you to make accurate predictions of comet shocks and make better decisions with your resources.<br /><br />2. I played twice totally. The first time I was stuck in the level 2, because I was too conservative and spent too much resources on risk preparations. The development goal is missed. I start to focus more on the development for the second time I played and kept in mind that the development is the final goal for the game. Risk management serves as a tool to help develop. There is no way you will win in the game if you take the risk preparation as the main course. By learning more about the game, I reached level 4 successfully.<br /><br />3. I will add the options to add living creatures to the community. Both the buildings and creatures have to be protected from comet shocks. Since lives are precious, the population of living creatures is not supposed to be fixed as easily as the buildings did. And it should be more vulnerable and more thoughts should be put on living creatures. This may increase the difficulty of the game and also give players a reminder that disasters have no mercy when it comes to lives, therefore risk management is of great importance.<br /></div>
