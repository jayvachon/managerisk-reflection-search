    <h1>Submission 2318 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307846, session_user_id: b2091e9f02b95bffacfc0b2ce5b2bf42137c3fe5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to make the community a stable, strong and prospering community. In order to reduce the risk, we needed to maintain community growth, have knowledge of the disasters, and use insurance for the benefit of damages. Managing the uncertain events needs a mix of knowledge of the occurrence, stability of the economy and also securing the assets for the damages that can occur. 
I made choices of building the community at level one and securing it by use of research. This made the community stable and created awareness about the coming disaster. The community was saved several times due to this method. Insurance was not a useful tool but it needed protection and hence was necessary. The protection handle was not used in the first level but later on the need for it arose. Preparation of risk required additional costs that needed to be removed from the development funds. Hence there was a slowdown in the development of the community and the growth was slow. We needed to balance both growth and risk. 
I played the game twice. I increased the research of the new risks that were entering. The community was getting developed at a comparatively slower pace and hence the additional cost was spent on covering the risk through insurance and protection from the disaster. In addition to this, when the disaster approached, the community could help one another and divide the risk among them and the damage level was comparatively lower. Hence the balance between development and risk cost was very essential. 
The key takeaways from this were the existence of insurance to cover up the damages, due to which the costs of repairing the community was lower than before. Insurance, knowledge and protection help in coping with the risks that are uncertain as always. These 3 tools can help a community, nation and the world to sustain for a longer period of time.
The newer version of the game would include a feature of dividing damage once the meteor hits the community. Once the meteor hits the community, it is hard to know what is happening and what the spots signify. One added feature could be help from outside communities which would also cost the community. This can be used during urgent and disaster times. Sometimes, the meteors crash at a high speed and with a higher disaster rate. So it is hard to ascertain or balance the effect of damage. In such cases, the help from other communities can be used.</div>
