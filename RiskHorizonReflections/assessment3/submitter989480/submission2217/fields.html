    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.- The risk management role was the most important point of the game, without even noticing i was learning, understanding and applying the concepts in the course, this is a great way to learn. I did many different trade-offs, first a built many plots but it did not work then i took my chances to increase the protection but then I did not have enough money to keep building and so on.I applied Knowledge, protection and insurance. The preparation for risk development Â affect in a big way because it is time and money consuming but at the end it pays off. It is a very important the way to go.<br /><br />2.- I played the game several times, at the beginning I thought that the best way to go was to build as many plots as possible without paying much attention to the protecting side, as I discovered after it it was not the right way to go. Then I gave a try increasing the protection without building many plots and this technique also did not work as I was expecting it. My next idea was to build half of the plot available, increase the protection, after it increase the pod level and this way I was able to reach the fourth level. Certainly i will keep playing the game to do a better research of how will be possible to be more effective. I would like to mention that this game is very catchy.<br /><br />3.- I believe the game is very well developed but i think that adding another kind of areas like recreation places and mountains or beaches locations could diversify the way to approach the problems and also the direction to prevent in a more effective manner some disasters. I really think that this kind of games should be push into the market so more people and specially kids could be able to prevent and plan different situations in their lives, it is a very important skill to have at hand.</div>
