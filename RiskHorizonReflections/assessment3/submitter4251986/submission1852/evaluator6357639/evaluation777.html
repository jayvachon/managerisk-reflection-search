    <div class="field-value">To me, the key strentght of this reflection seems to be that is written from a personal point of view. 
 I think you could have put more effort in making an overview and a good reflection of the content of the course in relation to the game. You stick a bit to much to the game, you could have thought deeper about the course and applied more of its content to your reflection. Also,  You could have explained better why you think insurance plays a big rol in the game (?) and why you think in real world you are not sure it is important....I think your point of income is clear though.</div>
