    <div class="field-value">Key Strength of the Reflection as I perceive: While the narration, includes the sequential experience of playing the game in a simplistic and genuine manner, the cognizance of relating this business strategy game to a case reference based in Vietnam, on Energy & Environmental concern adds value & a third dimension to explicitly illustrate a common natural risk management scenario, in a day-to-day life, which reflects a wider perspective of the Risk Management strategy.
Suggestion to represent the reflection better: While the game is based on a fuzzy logic mechanism depicting (i) The correlation between Number, Development & Protection of Pods, (ii) Recurrence of externalities in the form of comets etc, and (iii) Soft components of Knowledge Management, Research & Insurance for coping. The challenge is to strike a balance in an asymetrical manner, in a dynamic manner to sustain the implmentation and the upcoming development, which is the fundamental element of ramping up the task of building the community, which is by and large reflected, with inadequate reference to the interplay of roles vis-a-vis the outcomes. </div>
