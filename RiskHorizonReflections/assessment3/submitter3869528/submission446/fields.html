    <h1>Submission 446 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3869528, session_user_id: 3929cdca15860c8ab8f4206cf5f78d7505ff9f59)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is fun, but it is very difficult and tragic as the risk is shown as comets falling from the sky and cause damage to our village. At the beginning of the game, the risk is very large, as it is very easy to destroy the houses when you're at a low level, and only suffer damage as the game progresses.
At a low development, the game is slow and costs a lot to fill the energy bar, but more the village develops, more the risk is diversified. In the various games I've played I have followed different strategies. In the first games, I preferred build many houses quickly, but this also left me with no money to repair them after disasters. So I preferred as I was playing more, building fewer houses but upload faster level, this strategy was more successful and allowed me to go up to level 2. The game can still be significantly improved. I would put a greater number of natural disasters to make it more fun. In addition, on my computer screen I didnÂ´t see well the entire picture, so I had to guess the amount of the money available and it was the worst.
