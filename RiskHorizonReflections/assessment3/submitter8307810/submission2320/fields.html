    <h1>Submission 2320 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307810, session_user_id: 9ed7508f4f4bb6ba1e96eefc04f6fa76acbddf98)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game was to make
the community a stable, strong and prospering community. In order to reduce the
risk, we needed to maintain community growth, have knowledge of the disasters,
and use insurance for the benefit of damages. Managing the uncertain events
needs a mix of knowledge of the occurrence, stability of the economy and also
securing the assets for the damages that can occur. </p><p>I made choices of building the community at level one
and securing it by use of research. This made the community stable and created
awareness about the coming disaster. The community was saved several times due
to this method. Insurance was not a useful tool but it needed protection and
hence was necessary. The protection handle was not used in the first level but
later on the need for it arose. Preparation of risk required additional costs
that needed to be removed from the development funds. Hence there was a
slowdown in the development of the community and the growth was slow. We needed
to balance both growth and risk. </p><p>I played the game twice. I increased the research of
the new risks that were entering. The community was getting developed at a
comparatively slower pace and hence the additional cost was spent on covering
the risk through insurance and protection from the disaster. In addition to
this, when the disaster approached, the community could help one another and
divide the risk among them and the damage level was comparatively lower. Hence
the balance between development and risk cost was very essential. </p><p>The key takeaways from this were the existence of
insurance to cover up the damages, due to which the costs of repairing the
community was lower than before. Insurance, knowledge and protection help in
coping with the risks that are uncertain as always. These 3 tools can help a
community, nation and the world to sustain for a longer period of time.</p><p>







</p><p><span>The newer version of the game would include a feature
of dividing damage once the meteor hits the community. Once the meteor hits the
community, it is hard to know what is happening and what the spots signify. One
added feature could be help from outside communities which would also cost the
community. This can be used during urgent and disaster times. Sometimes, the
meteors crash at a high speed and with a higher disaster rate. So it is hard to
ascertain or balance the effect of damage. In such cases, the help from other
communities can be used. </span></p></div>
