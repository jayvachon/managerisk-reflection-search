    <div class="field-value">Clarity with which every aspect is covered is one best part of this reflection and makes it quite clear, the role of risk and threat as articulated was a very good part of the reflection presented above.

Proper analysis of the insurance option was also critical, it was good that you were able able to complete the game without using it actively, but in terms of articulation the insurance part should have been covered better.</div>
