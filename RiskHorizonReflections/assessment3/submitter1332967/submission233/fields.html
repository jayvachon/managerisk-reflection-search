    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Game Reflection: Risk Horizon Game</strong><br /></p><ul><li>The role of risk management in the
game was in the same line as the World Development Report, they both agreed. It
focus its importance in preventive actions, information to reach a better
understanding of the problems and their possible outcomes through research (<b>knowledge</b>), <b>protection</b> from defensive mechanisms and the community power,
through actions to diminish the likelihood or size of the impact; and copying
with damages or losses in bad times, thanks to the <b>insurance</b> through effective reparation (these are actions to
transfer resources to the most affected sectors). Among the strategies I used to
achieve better results, I start purchasing the most inclusive insurance, I kept
a constant medium level of protection at least, especially in the periods when
there were no imminent risks,  and I did
as much “research” as I could, to maximize the level of knowledge. Preparation for risk definitely worked better in
the medium-long term, when the three elements (knowledge, protection and
insurance) were at a good functioning level. In a low level, consequences were
much more negative and severe. So preparation for risk affect development later,
after some time.</li></ul><ul><li>To answer the second block of
questions, I played the game few times and I have tried different strategies: I
gave more or less importance to several options, discovering that research
usually helps the most ,along with insurance, to minimize the negative effects,
to the point of even avoiding them. The first time I played, I tried to
increase the protection over research, but I found over time that it was not
effective. The main thing I learned from the game support the leaning process
in this course: One interesting thing that I have learnt is that despite some
medium level protection interfaces, community power could really have a good
impact in mitigating the damages; this is, through communication, mutual
support and preparation. Also, I noticed risk is variable, and it is important
to research and pay attention to all kinds constantly: slow, non-frequent
events could be as damaging as quick or repeated threats. To me, the wave
indicates the consequences of this negative event, so it represents the  harmful consequences. After those, community
came back to a previous stage of protection (less good), which outlines the necessity
from the state to revise constantly this methods, keeping them up to date,
improving them, to maximize the benefits for the community and to minimize potential
losses. Besides, placing myself on the policy making side, on the
administrative side, on the high responsible side I realize about one thing:
there is never enough time, risk is constant and there is no idyllic risk planning,
it should be done at the same time as the population develops, it is not to be
postponed.</li></ul><ul><li>Answering the third question, if I
could give some ideas to improve a new version of this game  I would introduce risks of different natures,
such as socio-economic, for example an economic recession; or related to
health, illness for instance. In the game the risks are simplified to natural
disasters and in reality we experience broad, complex, different kind of risks.
The way they are tacked varies, so I guess it would result very interesting to
make it a bit more complex.<br /></li></ul></div>
