risk management in this game was to try to take care of different aspects to
avoid huge consequences once some natural risk happened in your little
community</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">At this
way, we had to manage key instruments in order to save our little stars
settlement, such as insurance, research and protection. Depending my income and
the threat, I had to consider how my city will performs better in order to
reach a high development despite the risks that surrender me, especially
dangerous and evil <span> </span>comets.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">For instance,
if comets threat was kind of low, I was able to chase a better protection while
upgrading my plots. If threats were high or dangerous and I couldn´t stop them
with more protection, I had to focus in insurance and research for a better performance
after the hit.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Preparation
for risk is a key figure in progress as if you forget , it can make a flat
growth for a long time, and stagnation can kill a new born or low income city,
making impossible for them to protect ad progress for the next years.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">I played it
different times and I must say that first time I did it quiet bad, as I forgot completely
about the research, so sometimes it happened that I didn´t had time enough to
create community connections so It was a such a great disaster!! After that, I chose
to take always a big care about research and protection, and insurance just
when the threat was a very high danger.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">I tried to
keep my protection index always higher that the threat, upgrading plots always
that I had cash and keeping a steady and unstoppable progress ;)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">One thing
that I will improve for this game is to erase the "severity" of
comets hits, as it´s something very unreal because in the real life you <span> </span>are not able to predict how big is gonna be
this threat. Doing so, as in the game, you´re able to play always with a
certain risk, and can manage much better your city, disregarding little
threats. If I wasn´t able to know this severity, I would be much more
preoccupied in protect and insure my population that knowing "it´s not a
big threat so I can keep living as I am for now".</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">This never
happen in real world with an earthquake or a tsunami, don´t taking into account
one of the key reasons for people usually doesn´t worry about risks.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Anyway it´s
a cool game to introduce newbies in risk management, no doubt.</span></p>
