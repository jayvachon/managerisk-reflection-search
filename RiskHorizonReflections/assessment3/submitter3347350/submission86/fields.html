    <h1>Submission 86 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3347350, session_user_id: 3ddffdbb92758dcd9e3febad346ed609bba6bfdb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management game was not as easy as I expected. The trade off was between development raising the height of land. I money spent on insurance only when there was an imminent threat. The research could be slipped in simultaneously, so that factor almost never a trade off. Preparation against risk hampered development for a short time. Since the game had a three minute timer, it is important to time the development and safety preparation just right. <br /><br />I started off playing it safe by raising the height and by insuring 75%. Very quickly that proved unsuccessful. So I changed my strategy to insuring only when big threat of a comet existed. And when the threat of the comet was imminent, I insured the land depending on the severity of the comet. Research on comets and development I made sure happened side by side. Also, I learnt that there is no point building more than 5 pods at any point in the game. It would be more wise to upgrade the pod and increase the development much faster and hence reach the objective mentioned. There were comets that come in and cause huge damage at the end of the time limit. This always happened at level 2 with a few seconds to go on the timer. <br /><br />If there were to change the game slightly, I would remove the option to increase the height of the land. I would introduce the living beings to the game and give options to invest in awareness and evacuation plans. Also, a more expensive option of having to invest in damage resistant pods which increase construction time would be a good option.  This would make the game feel more humanly as there is a situation of life and death. </div>
