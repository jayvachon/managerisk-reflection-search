    <div class="field-value">I really like the example of the time management between knowledge and protection. Also I completely agree with the fact that normally you cannot see a disaster coming beforehand. Though I know an example in West Africa where the Red Cross knew the day before that the place would be flooded. They tried to handle immediately by already sending goods to that place. Though they found it hard to find money to support that.....
Maybe you could improve the reflection by going more into depth instead of describing what happened in the game (I did the same thing, but I read another assessment and they described it very well in detail)
Thank you and good luck!
