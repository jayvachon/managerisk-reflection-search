    <h1>Submission 2267 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8264384, session_user_id: eb8bd5be72a2efe993fc4754c0c3676db9134d08)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There’s
no doubt that risk management plays a critical role in Risk Horizon. It’s the
key to development of Alora. Staying in the relatively dangerous condition,
only effective risk management can protect Alora from humorous losses. For one
thing, in terms of enriching the knowledge of risk management, I researched
every comet at least 1 time and researched more dangerous comets even 3 or 4
times in order to have more accurate data to set protection. For another, I
insist on purchasing the most expensive insurance at every level, for once the
hit happened, it was able to offer help as much possible. What’s more, I
continued to enhance the level of protection but not all the time. The
preparation for risk is costly and will reduce the speed of development
immediately, as we can see from the left side. However, it avoided more losses
when we faced disasters and was significant if our thinking pattern was based in
the long run.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>   I played this game more than once and have
accumulated some experience. It’s essential to keep a balance of development (economic
growth) and safety. Establishing more dams can enlarge the scale of economy and
provide more capitals for protecting. And enforcing the protection rapidly can ensure
the development. I have obtained a lot from the game and the main thing I
learned from Risk Horizon was how important the valid risk management was. Most
efforts such as buying insurance, establishing the connections between each village,
studying comets and so on were the investments in advanced. Thanks for these
efforts can we gain more possibilities of avoiding more losses and pursuing
opportunities.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>   I’d like to add a simple but effective warning
system in the new version. If I start the system before the hit of the comets,
my Alora can be damaged less. The more I pay for the system, the larger region
it can warn. The place I live has had a grave earthquake several years before
and the casualties were amazing, for the lack of effective risk management.
Unfortunately, we know the disaster may happen again in the future. Taking this
into account, more shelters and architects of better quality have been built.
Besides, more research resources have been put into predicting earthquake and providing
better education of self-protection for children. Although we are likely to
face the disaster again, I’m sure my city will have a brighter future.</span></p></div>
