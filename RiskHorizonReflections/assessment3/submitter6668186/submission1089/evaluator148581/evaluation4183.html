    <div class="field-value">I liked how the essay was rooted in the experience of the game. The final suggestion is interesting, although it could make the game considerably more complicated. I think that your conclusion on the insurance role may be somewhat "biased". You seem to have experienced very severe impact in your first attempt, which was short, and less severe in subsequent ones, which you were able to cope without insurance. This was also my experience in the lower levels of the game. However, when you attempt to work through the higher levels (4 and above) it seems very difficult to completely avoid insurance, as the value of the "property"  is now very high and it is simply too costly to avoid large damages simply increasing protection, in case of very severe comet impacts.</div>
