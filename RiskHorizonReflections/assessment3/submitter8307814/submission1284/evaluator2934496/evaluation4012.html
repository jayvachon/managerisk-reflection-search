    <div class="field-value">Excellent synthesis: you took many of the moving parts in the game and many of the principles learned in this course so far, and brought them together beautifully.  Very good job reflecting on what you would do differently the next time you played the game.

I would have liked you to describe how exactly you arrived at the "winning formula" or approach, whether it was more by trial and error or calculation.

Overall, excellent job.</div>
