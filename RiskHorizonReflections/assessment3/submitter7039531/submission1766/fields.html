    <div class="field-value"><p>Dear Team,</p>

<p>First of all, I need to
mention it was really hard job. Here is small virtual place that took me more
than two hours to achieve 4th level, learn how to create, protect and develop
it. You can imagine how many mistakes I had to admit. But in a real life for
sure we have no room for error. The
main role of risk management in the game in my case was to protect my village
and develop it, I almost didn’t use insurance. Sometimes the affection from
preparation was observed immediately, sometimes after some time. </p><p><span>
First
time I have built all homes, but it became very complicated to protect them,
and I decided to build just 3-4 to develop it and then began to build others. Also
it is very important to do research about comets because sometimes you see it
is coming and buy insurance use protection but in reality it will not offend
damages. What it comes to insurance, if you are going to use it do it later
after 3rd level for example. </span></p><p><span>The
main things I learned from the game, be careful with details, use all
information and only necessary points that make a sense now. Be always on
guard. <br />
Maybe in a new version I would
add other cases as financial, I do not mean financial strategy for government
or company, it can be made easy, such own financial strategy, made some decisions
and then learn would you lost all your money, assets or safely outlive
financial crisis. <br />
I
would like to thank the team for the opportunity to participate in this project.</span></p>

<p>Best regards,</p>
