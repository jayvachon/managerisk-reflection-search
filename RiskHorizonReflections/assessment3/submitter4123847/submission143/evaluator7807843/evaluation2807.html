    <div class="field-value">What I liked about this reflection is it's visualisation of the game's conditions in a city. Since I am from India, I see those same trade-offs- albeit ill-managed- in Mumbai, Bangalore etc.
I also liked the point that since politicians are making choices for us, they had better involves us in the decision making.
What I would have liked to see however, is more application rather than visualisation. How in particular in the city, could risk be managed with development? In Rio for example, Mayor Eduardo Paes has spoken about creating open spaces in concrete jungles, providing services such as quality education, healthcare, creating open spaces etc in favelas.
