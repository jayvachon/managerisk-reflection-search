    <div class="field-value">The reflector writes in a very clear and intelligent manner. I like the reflector's emphasis on balance as an essential component of risk management. I also like the language the reflector uses about primary v. secondary priorities and think this reflects the choices that must be made in risk management decisions.

Though it is a challenge, especially with a word limit, the reflection could be improved by discussing what protection, insurance, development, and knowledge mean in a more real world context (rather than the game). S/he does this well in the final answer.
