    <h1>Submission 1170 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6457242, session_user_id: 91cc371f0b61510d10e31b30ca9f4a0a76a02ec5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Reflections:<br /></p><p>1.In
this game,I think the role of risk management is to realize stable growth of
profit on the condition of good safety guarantee,and they both have impacts on
each other.Insurance can make up for income loss to some extent,but too much spending
on it hinders the expansion of
the company
in the short term.Thus,to
achieve long term development,development comes first in the beginning,and then
security guarantee such as insurance must be on the agenda.</p><p>2.The first time I
failed,then I read the instructions again and pay more attention to the
protection and insurance,not rapid income growth,and I concentrate on analyze
every planet(the risk in the game) no matter how small it is.From the game,I
learned that even the seemingly small risk could become great threat,and we
ought to make an detailed analysis of every possible risk.</p><p>3.At first,the kinds of possible risks should
be estimated by the player. In the real world,the first task of risk management
is to have an idea of the risks. As Chinese strategist Sun Tzu said, “Know
yourself and know your enemy, you will win every war.”

</p><p>Besides, versions of more than one player
can be developed in that the current version requires so much responsibilities
of the only player and sometimes it will hinder the risk management.</p><p>(P.S I'm not from English-speaking country and there're may be some mistakes in my essay.Hope that<span> you can forgive.</span><span> </span>)<br /></p>
