    <h1>Submission 2044 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 571402, session_user_id: c4638a8f4e874e37d9baa3ce52a1e0f3c98cde7b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is to enhance the proper mix of knowledge, protection and insurance to maximize development. If a society only invest in knowledge, will suffer some risks related with hazard (in our game, the impact of a comet); if a society invest too much in insurance, the opportunity cost related with investment in knowledge is too high, so will not maximize its development. So, also direct protection towards known risks should be provided.<br /><br />At the first time I played, was really into investment in insurance, so had less wealth to invest in knowledge nor protection; but as long I didn't invest in protection, suffered damages I had to repair, so the cost of insurances plus the cost of reparations was quite high; so couldn't reach the expected level of development.<br /><br />After some plays, tended to invest more in protection and knowledge and less in insurance, because once a proper protection against direct risks' effects, the damages are low (so they can easily be covered with insurances). That way I had more current wealth to invest in knowledge.<br /><br />Also, about knowledge, I tended to invest intensively into a little number of pods. The result was that some areas were very developed but other weren't, and the development of the whole society did'nt reach the goals; so after some plays, I used to upgrade some pods into a acceptable level of development (3) and then others into that same level, and once all reached this level, started to grow then into higher levels.<br /><br />The main learning I extracted is to invest into risk protection led to have a lower level of insurance and more wealth to invest in knowlegde, and the only way to reach goals in development is to have an equality between different areas (pods) of development.<br /></div>
