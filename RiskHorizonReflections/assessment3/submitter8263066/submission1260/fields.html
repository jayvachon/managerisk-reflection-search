    <h1>Submission 1260 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8263066, session_user_id: 79ac06d88b607ea7ab5cffd8c330e28d5c260a2e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1  Role of risk management in this game is to reduce extent of damage by protection (raising ground), insurance or reserach.  It is not to reduce the probability of comet hitting, as there is no method to reduce it.  <br />In clearing stage 1 (which took me many plays), I bought the highest insurance as first priority, as I stated above comets hitting is inevitable.  It does take time either.   Protection is slow in implementing, and pods don't produce cash while doing protection, so I found that the good time for ptotection is at the end of the stage and you have already exceeded stage's quantative target.<br />Preparation is requirement, and while prep strategy allow me to pass stage 1, I could not find right balance of cash usage between protection, research and building pods and failed to pass stage 2.<br />2  I played the game more than 10 times.  It was hard to figure out good balance by hunch.  Some quanatitative strategy might have been necessary.  At high level, I have felt that it is best to buy insurance first, increase pods adequately to meet the stage goal, do best in prepartion and making connection when hits, and raise protection at the end.   Stage 2 <br />3  Obvioustly, being where I am (Japan), I would need to add earthquake event, with option of making pods earthquake proof in compliant with building codes which costs cash but reduces insuance cost.<br /><br /></div>
