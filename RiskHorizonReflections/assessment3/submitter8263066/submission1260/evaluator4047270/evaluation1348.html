    <div class="field-value">The clarity and the content of the passage is well versed with the definitions provided in the course. The key strength of this reflection is that the student has clearly explained the role of protection, insurance and research. But if the student would have explained in one way that how the course has helped him/her  and how it may help the student in the coming days would make this reflection better as the comprehension was in short of words (min.400) as the answers were just in accordance to the questions which was good but required a little more explanation.
