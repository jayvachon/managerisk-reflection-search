    <div class="field-value">The kery strength of this reflection is linking the theory of both the lectures and the game to their own situation. It shows great comprehension of what the lacking of effective risk management can do to a country and how effective risk management could improve it. I also want to applaud the effort in playing the game with insufficient internet resources and writing a elaborate reflection about it. Moreover, I want to express my support in trying to improve their own and their countries situation.

I would suggest to follow english classes and improve the knowledge and proficiency in english.  </div>
