    <div class="field-value">I liked very much the reflection: "we are tempted to spend all our time and energy on expending our assets, and prefer to believe that we won’t be so unlucky to have the “asteroids” hit our houses. However, risk was and always will be a major factor of our lives and ignoring it will only escalated the possible damages."

I can not improve on this job, is really clear and have interesting conclusions.</div>
