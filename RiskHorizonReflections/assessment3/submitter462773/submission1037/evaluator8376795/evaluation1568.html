    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the detailed description of the game and its features. Very well understanding of the correlation of factors in the risk management.   
I would have invested little more time on the structure of the sentences. Few grammatical errors are causing confusion. However, despite the English difficulties that our classmate/colleague/friend has, it is a very evident that he/she has understand the most important elements of Risk management. </div>
