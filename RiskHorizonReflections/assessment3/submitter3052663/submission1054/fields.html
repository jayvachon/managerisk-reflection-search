    <h1>Submission 1054 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3052663, session_user_id: b64aa8e232c6d3ff28279e3b89daa113b372a6d8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Risk management play the main role in the game, there are three components of risk management: know your risk, insurance against it and build protection around. During my game I always bought level 1 insurance, protected my buildings with 3-5 level and build and upgrade as much as I could, probably that killed me after 4th level. Preparation for risk affects dramatically during the game, in my experience after hitting on 4th level with severe comet my progress bar became red and I had no time to recover.
2. I played once (+ tutorial). Next time I will probably pay more attention to insurance and research. 
3. I think for more accurate mapping of the risk management it is better to add insurance/protection for separate buildings (pods) and make connections between buildings visible and more static (it is strange that community connect only when comet hit, but not before)</div>
