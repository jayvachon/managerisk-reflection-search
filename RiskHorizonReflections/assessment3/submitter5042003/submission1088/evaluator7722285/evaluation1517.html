    <div class="field-value">The reflection is well formulated and clearly illustrates the role of trade-offs in relation to risk-management in the game. The strategic choices made during the game are also clearly described. I believe the reflection would benefit from a more elaborate description of the learning experience. Additionally, in regards to point 3 of the assignment, it is not exactly clear to me how the proposed alterations in the game are related to the risk management choices that matter in the place you live. This could be more clearly described.</div>
