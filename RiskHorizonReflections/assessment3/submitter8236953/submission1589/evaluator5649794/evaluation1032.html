    <div class="field-value">The strength is criticize the game well in both advantage and points need to develop, and also the ideas mentioned should be consider in any up coming modified version of the game. However the reflection could be better if it was more shortened in the descriptions of the game. 

I have the honor to work with you. Good Luke !!</div>
