    <div class="field-value">This text is very clear in its structure as well as in balancing description with reflection on "Risk horizon", it is very fluid in its explanations of correlation between events playing out. The student has explained how balance was achieved and what lessons were learnt from the first round, and, subsequently changed in later ones with improved results attained. The student has also demonstrated a very strategic and analytical mind, evidently whilst playing the game, but also in this analysis. 

The bullet pointing of the learning outcomes from playing the game is one of the key strengths in this text, as well as the possible implementation of opportunities which might act as catalysts for the development face (although the strengths are many). One minor potential could be to use somewhat less description of how the game was played - e.g. only briefly explained how things were executed and then move onto why things may have happened the way they did - but as mentioned, in my opinion, it is a pretty intact analysis. Well done! </div>
