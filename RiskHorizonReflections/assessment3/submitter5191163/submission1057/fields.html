    <h1>Submission 1057 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5191163, session_user_id: 155b6a86dccd51a1a485b2de26089a409649d2bd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1- The role of risk management was very important in the game which was confronting risks, preparing for them, coping<br />with their effects and creating balance between growing of  the community and preparing for bad shocks . I made some choices and trade-offs related to risk management like choosing between building new pods (developing community) or spending more money on protection and insurance , choosing the insurance plan considering my budget and surrounding risks, and improving my current community protection level to reduce the probability and size of loss and  gaining some knowledge about surrounding risks (<span>milestones) </span> .... actually i prepared for risk immediately in advance before happening of the chocks (milestones) by increasing my knowledge about the risk, choosing insurance plan a improving my community protection.<br /><br /><br />2- actually I <span>played the game more than once, in each time i gained more experience about how to manage the risk and how to use my limited resources to invest in my community and coping the surrounding risks (milestones). <br /></span><br /><div>I learned that Risk management can both increase development returns and reduce the propensity for crises and how to recover from negative shocks, and with good preparation, only minimal coping may be needed to recover quickly ,leaving more resources available for investment in risk management and reducing vulnerability to future shocks. and how risk management is an essential tool for development.<br /><br /><br />3- This game is good to learn about the process of risk management and its basic components , but i would like to add different kind of risks and more classes of insurance or illustrate the ways to protect the community not only increasing the indicator of protection. </div></div>
