    <div class="field-value">The understanding of how risk management components can be effective for development is the key strength of this reflection.
The one thing that I think would make this reflection better is what the World Development  Report 2014 called " The Way forward".  In fact, the reflection did not mention the potential role of the groups and collective action at different levels of society to overcome the obstacles that people encounter in managing risk.  The Horizon  game has a tool called research that effectively played the "The Way Forward" role.
