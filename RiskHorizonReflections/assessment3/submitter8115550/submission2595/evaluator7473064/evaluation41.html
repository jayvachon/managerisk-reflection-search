    <div class="field-value">Hello Prince,

what surprised me was that you used the insurance option a lot. I myself hardly used it and the other peer I have to review also only used it when all else failed. 
I hardly made use of the option because I thought that preparation is more valuable and should be invested into more than having an insurance cover the damages - which could easily be prevented if enough research of the comets is done and the elevation of the ground is kept at a high level. 

So one of the strong points in your reflection is that it made me wonder whether I neglected the insurance option to much. I guess I will go back to playing the game again and try this out! :)

I also very much liked that you pointed out that time management is an essential part of risk management! I hadn't even thought about putting it that way!

What could make your reflection even better? Hmm... Maybe your proposal of raising the funds if you were to be able to change something in the game. I think the limited funds we had for the game was one of the main elements. Like time management, management of your financial resources is also important and would probably also be limited in real life. If you had an endless amount of money you could invest in preparation, insurance and development at the same time - but this game was to show that it is immensely important to find a stable balance between these options...

Apart from that - great review!
Enjoy the rest of your course!

Regards,
Sophie</div>
