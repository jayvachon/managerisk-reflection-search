    <div class="field-value">The candidate has candidly presented his experience while playing the game , and not presented clearly the inferences developed from the game. I could not comprehend the meaning of fully insured . There should be adequate insurance and not full insurance . Too much focus on insurance alone would jeoparadise further protection and research activities as countries where such natural calamities are frequent  face funds crisis too . Therefore , more research and protection is essential to help the country protect the people from natural disasters as well focus on national development. </div>
