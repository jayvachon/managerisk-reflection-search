    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is the general thoughtfulness, as well as the application of concepts into real-life examples (i.e. old-age insurance). Perhaps the interdependency and interrelatedness of the four risk management tools - including the role of development/growth in order to obtain resources for insurance measures, and the decision process of how much insurance is the right choice - could have added even further to the reflection.  

All in all, good job. 

(One final comment - an admittedly oversimplified way of describing the *social* or *human factor* would be the general *level of trust* towards the state and towards each other within a society. However, quantitatively measuring this *trust level* still remains a huge problem.)  </div>
