    <div class="field-value">This reflection captures elements of the experience of role-playing a risk manager. The trade-offs between knowledge, protection and insurance, and how you altered their contribution to managing the risk are well emphasized. The suggested change to the game is also well thought. The reflection would benefit from a clearer and more focused narration. </div>
