    <h1>Submission 485 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2186986, session_user_id: e9224bc68d83b2a43202ca0bfd9d5c708a27d264)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">All the risk management components are embedded in the game. First of all, you have to decide how much it is worth investing in risk management, provided that this drain away resources from the the budget for village development. Once you have earmarked the budget for risk management you need time (and little money) to analyse the risks (studying the meteores), decide what preventitive action to impement to manage the risk (protection vs insurance), depending on the significance of the risk. Investing in more protection decreases the likelyhood of nasty consequences, as well as studying the risk; insurance provide resources for recovery but it becomes expensive as the village developes.<br />I was able to complete level 4 twice playing four times, but I am not sure I have learned with subsequent playing. I think the game is too fast paced to catch effectively the implications of all your choices. Nevertheless, I have learned that:<br />- research is relatively cheap but takes time (you cannot do other things when studying meteors);<br />- insurance is relatively cheap when the good to be protected (the village) has relatively low value;<br />- when the village is well developed, protection and research are the best allies.<br />If I had the chance to modify the game I would definetely decrease the speed of it; in fact, if you are good at risk management but you are not good at playing videogames, you may risk to get a very bad score.<br /><br /></div>
