    <h1>Submission 2547 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8128551, session_user_id: b61783bf4b5ab198f30d25b80f27a1e74747d785)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management played a role in the game as I had to combine knowledge, protection and insurance. I had to make decisions on what I would invest more money in and ensure that I was prepared for the risk whilst also having the ability to cope if the risk was materialised. With limited money, at times I had to trade-off between knowledge, protection and insurance. I found that it was important to build resilience against risk and therefore I invested more in knowledge and protection. The reason being, insurance was for coping with the shocks. I found that it was important to deal with the risk before it had a negative impact on the development. I did invest money in the insurance package to ensure that if I was hit by the comet, I had something to help with the costs. I found that preparing for risk through protection did affect development as I had to spend more time increasing protection. However, I found that in the long term it was beneficial as the protection increased gradually and it helped to ensure that the development was protected against comets. Knowledge helped with gathering information about severity of comet and how likely it was to hit. From this information, I combined protection with research to combat the risk.Â <br /><br />I played the game three times. When playing the first game, I did not get past the first level. I found that the reason was, I focused on developing the pods and not on protection. As a result, when a severe comet hit, I was not adequately protected and therefore the pods were destroyed. I learnt from the first game, that it was important to invest in protection gradually. This helped protect me when comets hit and in the long term as I was able to build on it for the other levels. I also found it important to combine the protection with knowledge. When the comets were coming, I made sure that I made significant research which helped to offset the damage the comet may have caused. The combination of this and the protection helped to ensure that I was protected from the comets and could therefore develop.<br /><br /><span>One thing that I would change in the game, is the different types of risk. Sometimes, you will have several risks to manage however in the game, the only risk was being hit by the comet. This risk is more related to natural disasters however there are additional risks and this would make risk management more challenging. As a result, the trade-offs between knowledge, protection and insurance would have to take into account these types of risks.</span><br /></div>
