    <h1>Submission 1557 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8192395, session_user_id: e3f8bd98192c1d9d2c32656ab3f7c61c9514a174)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The aim of the game was to manage environment from certain and/or uncertian risks of pollutions. To advance prepare for possible risks, my first step was getting important knowledge such as the level of shocks, aftermath of potential damage and conditions after than. I tried to build more green areas as much as I could to reduce the level of damage and increase benefits. I clearly saw that much more green areas means much less damage in the game. Regarding to severity and chance of hit, I could estimated potential and have actions to grow our community. After having some shocks, I tried to recover the damaged and boosted protection by building new plots and facilities. Another important fact is cost analysis in the game. After each hit of comets, I needed to spent money to recover the damage. Obviously, if you are not financially secure for risks, you can not protect and rebuild your community. In my first play, I didn't pay attention for insurance plan, therefore it was financialy hard to replace my loss. In next game, I was so carefully when I manage repair cost. To get more benefits, having a really good insurance plan is also very significant as much as having useful knowledge, protection plan and coping plan. I think that another important part is having institutional response to get more advantages and to decrease possible loss. When I moved to higher levels of the games, I noticed having more pods helped me a lot to have more green areas and to mitigate the level of damage. <br /><br />To simplify, I learned from this game that understanding the level of shocks or risks is the first step for risk management. We need to reduce the uncertainty and understand possible outcomes after hitting some devastating events by learning the chance of comet hitting and its impact. The second step is protection that means reducing probability loss and increasing benefits by having more green areas and building or upgrading pods. To change the station from bad to good, we need to have a good insurance plan and use money efficiently to recover damages. In the game, I could practice how to repair and rebuild my pods in cheap way right away.<br /><br />To develop the game, I would put more natural disasters such as earthquake, tsunami or flood. I would also put more options for purchasing coverages besides using money such as some objects or items.   </div>
