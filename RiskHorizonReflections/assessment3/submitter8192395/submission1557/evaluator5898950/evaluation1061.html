    <div class="field-value">The author understands the material well and is able to apply the game to the course very well. 
To make the reflection better, I would recommend to put more analysis and less summary. The author seems to understand the material very well, and analysis is strong. Readers would benefit if there was more of this strong analysis. </div>
