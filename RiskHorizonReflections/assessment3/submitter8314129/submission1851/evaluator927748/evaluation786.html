    <div class="field-value">I think the key strength of this reflection is how the author link what he/she learnt from the game with Prague’s experience facing floods. Moreover, focusing in making prediction by data analysis that it can improve the activities of risk management was a powerful and useful learning from his/her interaction with the game.

From other perspective, maybe for a next time, you can be more precise and clear when you talk about a very important element as learning and experience curve, described at the first and second paragraph.
