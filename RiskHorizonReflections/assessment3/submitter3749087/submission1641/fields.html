    <h1>Submission 1641 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3749087, session_user_id: a270436e754a33023317d9800fd5171ba95c9bc7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
role of risk management was very important because if you do not reach foresaw
you could not develop anything or if you do, it will not last too much. Time
management and start thinking about different strategies such as having an
insurance to lower the payment of damages, was always an option that I took first.</p>

<p> At
times I was limited by time, and the number of meteorites that fell with
different levels of impact, I lwas urged to see what were the best ways to
prevent the risk in a short amount of time. I think to manage risk is also necessary a
good emotional intelligence to manage stress and take fast decisions.</p>

<p>Raise
the community to lessen the effect of impact was one of the least expensive and
also effective actions. An important aspect was the study of meteorites and
impact level for planning community development,  while they have a slight impact one
could carry out quietly with the development but if these had an impact of high
damage, then get ready to face the consequences. I also noticed that while the more
research were you doing  the more time
you get to establish connections between community members. Sometimes  damage was reduced to 0%. </p>

<p>If
I would have the chance to make something different is to use better the time.  At level 4 I should have built and make
improvements faster, but another fact was that funds were limited, so how could
I build with limited funds?.</p><p> In general for all the game and the life itself, I think that my main strategy would be
to improve the usage of time and resources at the time I research for information and based on it get the appropiate insurance and security measures to cope with the risk. Also I will prepare myself emotionally, it is very important to deal with all unexpected events. </p>

<p>My
proposal to improve the game will be the following: At the end of the game I
would add a dialog box that indicates how was the behavior of the player during
the level, which was trend and some tips on how he should act to improve the
player's performance. In this way, the player would be aware of what he is doing and
he would act more effectively in the management of risk.</p>
