    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk
Management plays many roles in this game which are: to
be able to fight the risk (the comets in this case) in order to gain prosperity, to be able to cope with any losses that would be made and be prepared for
the possibility of lose (by buying insurance) in order to be as successful as
possible.</p>

<p>For the
most part, I focused on having a good protection (at least 2 blue bars) in
order to be able to avoid loses. However, this came at a price of not insuring
the vast  majority of the time which was
a poor preparation for risks which could occur at any time. But as insurance
was not focused on much, protection was quite solid and very rarely (but not
never) let anything pass through it, and even if that happened, loses were not
too drastic, but they were still loses. Knowledge played an important part in
knowing exactly what I'm up against and made it 
much easier to defend the pods. Preparation for risk which was mostly
using protection in this case usually affected development after a period of
time, although there were cases where it immediately affected but that was in
the case of comets with low severity only.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I played
the game multiple times and what I did differently was to focus on other
aspects as in my first try I focused too much on protection and too little on
research and insurance.  I learned to be
aware of the possibility of loss and to make a backup plan should my protection
fail (by buying insurance and I also learned that since it is usually not
affordable to have powerful protection all the time (should one want great
prosperity) learning about the risks -the comets- can not only make you deal
with them more effectively, but also save you money that can be invested
somewhere else such as increasing prosperity. I also learned to always put a
bit of extra protection if I can afford to as risks may seem less dangerous
than they actually are.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I
believe that pods should have accidents would make the game represent risk
management better. The impact of those accidents should be possible to reduce
by getting insurance. Accidents like fire breakouts sometimes occur in my
country and my country is not prepared so loses happen.</p></div>
