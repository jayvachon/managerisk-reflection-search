    <div class="field-value">Great description of the role of risk management and development, and the complex web of tradeoffs one had to manage while playing the game. I like how you identified the importance of developing and having your colony's economy produce enough surplus wealth to be able to afford risk management tools. This being said, your essay was too long at 600 words. I think you could have gotten your point across in the 400 word budget.  </div>
