    <h1>Submission 340 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1605215, session_user_id: 63a9909426ee512d43cdf32cd4dc8783d9156b64)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
This game, a reflection of the course so far,
shows risk management in the context of development (spending money to build
pods) and allows the player to decide on the purchase of investing in insurance
(reducing the price of rebuilding pods AFTER a disaster), protection (against
the tsunami caused by the comet) and the power of research (that allows you to
create community connections before the comet hits).  There was a constant trade-off between
investing in more and more substantial pods (development) and preparing for the
on-coming comet (disaster).   </p>

<p>2.      
I first played the game without watching the
tutorial – and my results were miserable. 
I could not win the first level because I did not understand the cause
and effect of my actions.  Once I watched
the tutorial, I starting watching the colored meter on the left.   The concept that research and knowledge
could affect the preparedness of the inhabitants – and prevent damage from
incoming comets – was made clearer by this game.  </p>

<p>3.      
If I were to design a Risk Management game, I
would start with a real-world case study from a significantly-improved disaster
location such as the Bangladesh typhoon preparedness (1970 to 2007) or the food
insecurity program in Ethiopia (1999 to 2005). 
I would allow players to allocate both a federal and local budget across
several realistic options such as : 
research (such as a predictive system for the expected disaaster),
public knowledge (early warning systems and children and adult education),  protection (actions/physical preparations),
insurance (to pay for damage after the disaster), and set-aside for disaster
recovery.   After each budget allocation,
the disaster would occur – incurring some level of damage and cost – and
another budget would then be allocated in preparation for the next.  To make the situation even more realistic, I
would have multiple players play the game together as teams so that they would
have to agree on their allocation of resources before each disaster – requiring
them to debate various scenarios in an attempt to predict the outcome.  Teams would be required to state their
strategy and rationale for each round of play. 
Teams results could be compared to determine who has most effectively
handled the risk management resource allocations through a series of 6 to 8
disasters.  </p></div>
