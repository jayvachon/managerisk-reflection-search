    <h1>Submission 2384 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7782481, session_user_id: 54cbd9ffc310819e764a26e13c2c5571ad5da1d2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management means the capacity to prepare in advance combined with coping with consequences once the risk materializes. The game had all the elements of risk management as it required preparation that included developing enough pods to generate revenue
flows needed to purchase protection and insurance well in advance and also involved coping with consequences once the shocks materialized like community connectedness. In a risky world (in the game) where comets with differing severity and probability
are frequent, in order to develop, risks need to be managed proactively, systematically and in an integrated manner. Mismanaged risks prove to be costly, but the measures required to prepare better, like a higher insurance plan, in the game, also come
costly. In the game, the need to be constantly prepared was very striking. However, by investing in the protection and insurance, the costs of coping were beneficial and the repairs even after the shocks materialized were cheaper thus making preparation
beneficial vis a vis coping in the game. This was an important trade off that needed assessment of the incoming risk and the decision to invest in protection plans. However, when the severity and the probability of the shocks were low, the investments
in the protection and insurance plans decreased but as the uncertainty of the risks curtailed the certain costs. Thus risk management requires considering different risks and the relative need of preparing for each of them. Also, choices had to be made
between purchase of a higher plan of insurance or a higher plan of upgrade of pods that also depended on the certainty and severity of the incoming shocks. Investing in a higher insurance plan, well in advance would be the thing to be done differently
if played the second time. After the first time, we ensured that more resources are invested in upgrading the pods in which investments had already taken place as they fetched more returns. This in turn helped invest in better risk preparation. Also,
after some time, it was realized that when enough money is not available, time can be utilized to lift the land, as it does not involve huge amount and is progressive. The key learning from the game was that once shock materialized, the coping in terms
of community connectedness had to be very swift and efficient. This highlights the importance of trained human capital and planning assets deployment in the coping phase. Also, the shocks come with a signal or an indicator. But calamities can take place
even without notice like the rare but severe ones. In such cases full proof preparation might not help and coping efficiently is the only alternative. Insurance is not a full proof protection. It only helps reduce or limit the damage. Probability (chance
if hit) is only an indicator and it is very hard to forecast shocks. Constant alertness and preparation and building from the beginning are some of the key learnings. Also development of a pod takes time. We have to plan in such a way that the development
work is done with advance preparation and hence the need to manage time, which is also an important resource in risk management. The costs of developing various pods are similar in the game. This is not true in real life situations. In actual situations,
even choices have to be made in differing development plans based on costs and thus the priorities of development have to be set up accordingly. This element of differing development costs needs to be added in the game.
