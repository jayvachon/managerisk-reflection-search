    <div class="field-value">There were 3 questions on which they essay should be based on. Unfortunately in this essay some answers/ reflections are missing. There is no information what choices the player made, and no explanations how preparation for risk affect development - according to this game. There is also no information how many times the player played the game and if he/she have made some actions differently when he/she played the game again. According to third question there is lack of some suggestions how improve the game.
In my opinion the author of this essay, focuses on risk management without closely concern to this game. He/she described in detail some risk management process and it is really good. However, the point of this game - in my opinion - was to combine/connect actions in this game with the knowledge from lectures. The missing part in this essay is this connection.
I know that this game was quite difficult. I achieved only 2 level. Somehow playing this game was frustrating and maybe this is a reason why the author of this essay focuses only on risk management, not on the game. </div>
