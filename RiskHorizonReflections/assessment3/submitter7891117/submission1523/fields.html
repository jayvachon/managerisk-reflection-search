    <h1>Submission 1523 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7891117, session_user_id: 4d70b891722067dc220e7aa5fc42329256465962)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">        Through this game,i deeply understand risk of management by applying knowledge, protection and insurance.It only can be succeed  by a combination of the three elements.I played several times of the tutorial edition to make out successfully how this game work.This can be a knowledge learning  as well as experience accumulation part since it enables me to better play this game.<br />        when starting the game,the first thing for me is to build one rod and then buy the insurance, as i accumulate my resources i build more rods and upgrade them and  at the same time i use resources to raise the land. When comet is about to come,i gained knowledge by clicking on a comet and keeping it's box focused on screen before it fall into the sea, i spending more time studying its severity, and the chances to hit. Through this i receive more time to create community connections right before the comet hits, helping boost my protection. This is from the knowledge part, studying it, knowing it, then applying it. Then goes to the protection part. In this game, the main protection i adopted was to  raise the land,by using the resources.I studied the severity of the coming comet, and the chances to be hit, then make out how much level should i raise,one two, or three, regarding the severity of the comet and this is the protection part. As for the  insurance part, i bought insurance once i started the game which covers 75%,this was an effective way for recovering the community once been hit.<br />       I played this game more than 5 times, and every time i learned a little bit more. The first time i played, i did not pass the first level. and the main reason is out of time. i may know how to act, how to protect, i could make good use of knowledge, insurance and protection to build more rods,but i ignored time.Then it turned out no matter how hard you've tried to avoid the hit, out of time makes all the effort in vain. This reminds me of this week's lecture---"behavioral biases" of "managing risk in developing countries", the "procrastination".people should react to shocks in an appropriate time,or in an effective time period. sooner than later. once you  fully prepared, take action and make no delays. In many shocks,especially natural disasters respond earlier means save more lives.This is the biggest inspiration to me since many times i failed for this reason in this game.<br />        If i could redesign the game i would reinforce the help of external environments, say international groups or institutions, like CARE ( cooperative for assistance and relief everywhere,Inc).To most situations, help from outer organizations and other counties plays a very big role, while in this game there only reflected a connection within the community by clicking the stars after hit and no reflection of the outer help. Suppose we can use some bonuses, say, after successfully recover  from or avoid two or three comet hits, the community will get a free insurance or free upgrade from the outer organizations. In this case, it works much more like the real case and would be much more instructive.<br />       This game really teach me a lot. Only through a balanced basis can things be worked out.In this case,everyone should strike a balance among time,resources,knowledge,protections,insurance in order to keep the community to the best. This rule can be applied in almost every project of the real life, to make full use of all resources and make things out.<br /><br /></div>
