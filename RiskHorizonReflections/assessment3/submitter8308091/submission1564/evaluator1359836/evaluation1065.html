    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that it discusses the student's learned lessons through out the game than merely describing what happened in the game.  It talks about research, insurance, protection, and the coping strategy that the game has.  I also like the fact that the student pointed out what's the use of upgrading the pods other than having a beautiful community at the end of your game.  However, if there is something that I think would make this reflection better is that when the student said that he/she invested in minimum insurance because of his/her research on the comets - how sure the student is that the pods need minimum insurance since comets have different severity and chance of hit?  I think the student can dwell more on why he/she is able to say that.  But overall, I think this is a good reflection of the game.  Thank you.</div>
