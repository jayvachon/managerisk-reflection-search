    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">During the game the risk management role was to prepare for the shocks and for this I decided to to do intensive investments in research and protection and choosing only a 1st grade insurrance in order to diminish the damages and to foster fast recovery. Despite the fatct that this aproach lead me to level 5 I observed duiring the levels that on short run the development velocity was affected however I had the chance to stay on the game fo a sufficent period.<br />I wil try to inest more in insurrance because during my final level the event very close to the end materialized in loss that can not be recoverd. The conclusion is that you have to be prepared against shocks by a mixt of research, protection &amp; insurance.<br />FInally I will like to propose to have an information about  cost effectiviness of each action. </div>
