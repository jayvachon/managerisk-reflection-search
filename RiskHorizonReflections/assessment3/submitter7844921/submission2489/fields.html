    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.) Risk management played an important role as township had to be protected against the comets and it was a difficult task to judge how much damage it will make . the risk of comet hitting was a crucial part because hitting the comet or missing of the comet would only decide the funds needed for further development, Insurance was taken as a priority against the other two because some times knowledge and protection  alone cannot help to recover from disaster .the preparation has to be immediate because the development is affected and to keep the pace of development one need to be immediately prepared . to maintain a trade off 50% insurance 20% knowledge and 30% protection would be a right option to manage a risk.<br /> 2) Playing the game second time focus would have been more on development pare and more over to that protection from the risk would be the priority because no doubt the development is affected when ever their is risk but one could save the funds and can utilize more funds for further development if one has insurance cover or any other protection.<br />3) one extra thing which was missing in the game and i would like to add would be the causalities and no of deaths and the other thing would be making a particular missile which would give me an option to destroy 3 comets in the sky it self because due to technology we have choices to over come from the risk , but the thing is we have to make the write decision , and three chances for all the six rounds would have been appropriate to destroy a particular comet.<br />In the place and one option of fund generation which was automatic in the game . I live has big buildings what i think it should have a proper disaster management team , which wold continuously guide the people and should  a mock drill in case of a particular risk , that if in case a particular thing happens then how to react in that particular situation and how to work after that by performing it in front of the people  .<br />Key Learning from the game was:<br /><ul><li>Allocation of funds during the happening of a particular risk</li><li>management of risk in case of a natural disaster and that too which is known <br /></li><li>Preparation and after effects of a particular risk </li><li>Determining the sevearity of the risk and damage it will cause to the town</li><li>Disaster Management techniques in terms of money ( investment , fund allocations and funds generation )<br /></li></ul><br /><br /></div>
