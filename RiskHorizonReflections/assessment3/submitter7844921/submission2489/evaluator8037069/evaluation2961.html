    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this game was on following the required number of words (although it was over by a little) and the answers were numbered to the questions which made it easy to review going back and forth through the reflection and the question although it seems like some answers were in the wrong numbering.

One thing that would make this reflection better is placing/stating the reflection/answers to the correct sequencing as stated in the questions. It seems also that the student forgot to proof read his reflection thus missing some grammar and misspelled words.</div>
