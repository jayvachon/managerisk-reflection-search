    <h1>Submission 1430 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5410875, session_user_id: 6b6d6678733983fc9a01ae7bc1acb4f92c4d8e22)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>When I started for the first time, I built as much as I could. However, the lack of money forced me not to insure the houses. After a couple of disasters, the loses were unrecovered and I was out.</p><p>Later, I managed to build houses (I left 2 lands empty) to have enough money for insurance. It worked well with some luck in having no disasters. However, I could not develop these houses because the cash was used in insurance. Again, I got lucky for some minutes but later the flood ate my village.</p><p>The third time I played, I focused on quality not quantity. I selected to build 3 houses and develop them with insurance to go for level 2. It went well until I decided to expand again.</p><p>I learned that risks sometime are predictable from the history or from some signs I can notice. Sometime I get lucky, but hoping to be lucky is not a wise decision.</p><p>Therefore, you have to be smart and think " what could go wrong'' even after you take the precautions, what can you plan/do to reduce the negative effects and if you failed, how can you live with the consequences.  </p><p>If I would develop the game, I would put some news about more negative/bad situations that may occur like financial crises (which will lower your income), more dangers (rains and thunders) and diseases. Putting yourself in the corner will force you to think out of the box and start to be creative. I might add also some migration methods or Government and community help/support. As much as you can survive within these bad situation, the more creative and thinker you are. Sometimes, preparing yourself for bad situation will illuminate some ideas that you would not think about in normal situations. I might add one thin as well which a reduction in the time as you advance in the game to allow you practice fast thinking and decision making. At the end, it is a game to have fun and use your brain.</p></div>
