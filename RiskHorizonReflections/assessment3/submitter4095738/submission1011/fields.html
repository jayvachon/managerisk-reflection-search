    <h1>Submission 1011 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4095738, session_user_id: 1feb412ca655172fe404f067c1ebc6133a0f955f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I play the game more than once and I went through a series of alternatives in the different times. The thing I always did first was paying for an insurance, and I found it pretty simple to have a 75% insurance, which allowed me to pay less for damage and concentrate more on research and development. I preferred to hold a medium protection and to monitor every comet, focussing on those with high severity, which led to immediately safety and a reasonable safety after some time. At first I built a lot and developed less, but then I learnt to build less and gradually and upgrade a bit at a time. This allowed to have more money to use to pay for new buildings, upgrades and damages. One thing that was very helpful to pass levels and that I think is an important aspect of risk management was research comets, because it is less expensive than paying for possible damages. I tried to balance knowledge and protection, as well as development. It would have been nice to have more focus on the connection aspect of the game and risk management not only when the comets strike, but also during the knowledge and development stages, which in real life can make people better understand the danger they possibly could face.</p></div>
