    <div class="field-value">Overall good piece, a little confusingly explained at times. The trade-offs are well explained and his learnings explicited, but not summarised. His suggestion to include people development -not only pods- is very good and useful. Overall good, needs some rewriting to make it better, but he has learned and explained in his own language the lessons and trade offs of the game.</div>
