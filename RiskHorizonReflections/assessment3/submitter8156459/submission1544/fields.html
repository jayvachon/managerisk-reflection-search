    <h1>Submission 1544 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8156459, session_user_id: 96ad8035d8469defe3a2961d45d009e23a408a5d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management can be described as the process that
involves confronting risks , preparing for them 
and than coping with their effects . In the case of this game the shock
was the commets that were hitting the planet. As in real life I had different
types of tools . In the beginning I did not realise how important reseach was .
I was increasing protection only by raising my island . That was unsuccesfull
as it was consuming lots of money but it wasn’t effectively protecting the
country  as it was long term protection
and it didn’t really protect from the commets coming right that second .Also
the damage was much greater .</p>

<p>Because a lot of money was used to raise the island (
protect it ) it did affect development as I did not have enough money to take
care of the pods .</p>

<p>Later on I found out that reseach is extremely important
because it increases peoples knowledge about the commet , and therefore
increases the chances of effectively protecting agaist it. I found that if the
possibility of the commet was high , if researched more than the possibility ,
the commet wouldn’t hit the planet.  Also
because research is so important and helps prevent the shock not much money is
used , therefore more development .</p>

<p>Insurance is also extremely important and I have always
tried to buy as much as possible because as a result if a commet does hit it
will be so much cheaper to repair the damage .Buying insurance is defensately
cost effective as the costs of repairing without it would have been much higher
.</p>

<p> What I learned from
the game is that this tools – knowledge ,protection , insurance and coping –
are important but not on their own . There has to be a balance between all of
them in order to effectively manage risk . For example , first time I played it
I was reaserching a lot hoping that by knowing as much as possible about the
planet will protect me enough . If the probability of hitting was low the
commet would miss the planet but if not the damage would be great . Afterwards I
tried to balance between reseach and protection ( already having insurance )
and in many cases the commet missed.</p><p>
















</p><p>One thing that I would add to the game would be people and
also the type of country they live in ( developing country or highly developed
) . The person playing could be able to choose and also prepare the people in
case of a shock .The game could have households and pods . For the households
there could be levels of protection and the peoples knowledge about the shock
and how to protect against it .</p>
