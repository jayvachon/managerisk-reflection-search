    <div class="field-value">This reflection is a very clear, articulated and deep analysis of key concepts/elements of risk management and their interrelations. The writer starts from the game, but s/he applies her/his learning to the real world and real life. In her/his game experience, the writer tried different approaches and found out the key role of resource use, growth/development, insurance and community linkages, showing the positive/negative aspects of each tool. 
The idea proposed by the writer to add to the game joint prevention measures/research with other cities and countries, since several environmental issues are global and can be solved in collaboration, also shows a very good understanding of the course's concepts and its purposes, as well as of the game's. Congratulations!</div>
