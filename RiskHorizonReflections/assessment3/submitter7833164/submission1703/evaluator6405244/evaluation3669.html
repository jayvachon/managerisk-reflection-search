    <div class="field-value">The key strength would be that it's written by a person who has actually played and understood the game,which is clear from the details that are present in the piece. Very well written,clear and to the point! 

If I had to think of some things to make it better I would probably add how these steps that you took to save the planet from comets could be applied in similar situations in real life (minus the comets,of course!). That would give a clearer picture and show thorough understanding of the concepts!</div>
