    <div class="field-value">the key strength of the reflection is that the student has given some concrete examples as to why risk management is so crucial, especially in developing countries.
This reflection, however, could have been better if the student had given some more reference to the things he/she learned while playing the game. The student did not mention how he/she would have played the game differently had he/she tried again. nor did he/she propose any improvements that could be incorporated in the game. These two things were necessary to mention and definitely would have made the reflection better. Moreover, the student should  take care to correct his/her grammatical mistakes before making the final submission.</div>
