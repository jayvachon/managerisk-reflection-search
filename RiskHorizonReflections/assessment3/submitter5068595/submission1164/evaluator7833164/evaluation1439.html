    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the fact that the student was able to grasp some aspects of risk management & its implementation in the "risk horizon" game.

The assignment should have clearly elaborated the concepts of knowledge, protection & insurance as well as role of risk management choices that one should make while playing the game. The student should have given an account of how & in what ways did the preparation of risk affect development.

Also, instead of giving a conclusion that the student was not good in preparation of risk, he/she should have mentioned the main things that were learnt from the game.</div>
