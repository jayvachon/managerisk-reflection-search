    <div class="field-value">Nicely done.  The reflection demonstrates  clear evidence of grasping the concepts of risk management - specifically applied to the business sector.   The refection however, was rather dry and "lifeless" and would have benefited from more "personal" insights.  I didn't gather if the game was played once or multiple times; and, if any cross-over examples such as how the top-down, bottom-up approach directly manifested itself in the game.</div>
