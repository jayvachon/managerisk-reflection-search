    <h1>Submission 1255 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7456893, session_user_id: 5a7793bdedcdaecf6a71cc922c5828079299be58)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Answer to Q 1.</strong> <br /><ol><li>Risk management defines the mechanism of confronting the risk, preparing for them and coping with the adverse affects. Here comets are like the shocks which affecting internal and external environment of the planet alora resulting in adverse outcome. With reference to the game the interlinked component of risk management pictured nicely with community development by building and developing pods, facilitating research regarding the severity of comets which pursues application of knowledge aided research thereby receiving more time to protect the community and providing 3 different insurance cover for the same.Lastly the benefit of risk management over weigh the cost of resources to cushion the development.</li><li>In the game i choose all the 3 choices to proceed in the next level.</li><li>Preparation of Risk affecting development is not for short term. It affect development immediately as protecting the planet alora from shocks but it should be envisaged further to harness the development</li></ol><strong>Answer to Q 2.<br /></strong><ol><li>I attempted the game twice. In first attempt, I failed in level 2 owing to not acquainted with the procedure of game. In first try i haven't take any insurance cover and moreover i haven't increase my protection against the severity of risk. But in second attempts i used all the interlinked components of risk management like developing and upgrading the pods, take insurance cover of 75% which incurred me less cost regarding reconstruction of pods, uplift the ground level more above the sea level so that the severity of risk cost less damage to my community and apply more research to each comets thereby getting more time to build and upgrade the community of alora.  </li><li>More you uplift the ground and involved community development and up-gradation, more is your development of alora and with increased power to withstand the severity of risk. But the process of managing the risk comes with the cost of resources. With respect to cost benefit analysis the benefit of risk management is more than the cost incurred. Moreover protection helps to reduce the probability of the size of losses and increase the benefits. And lastly proper insurance cover helps to repair the pods thereby adjusting the cost against the severity of risk.</li></ol><strong>Answer to Q 3.<br /></strong>For further clarification of the choices of risk management I propose to introduce different insurance cover for different comets. And in terms of changes i want to adjust the level of severity with the increase of research. With pursuit of knowledge one can also prepare for the risk thereby in better position to cope with severity of risk. So more the knowledge and research will increase, less will be the affect of severity of comets hitting the ocean floor.<br /><br /></div>
