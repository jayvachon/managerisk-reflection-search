    <div class="field-value">1. What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
Two things, the essay would benefit from are: - Sometimes the languages seemed to be off and therefore the meaning of some sentences became confusing.
                                                                        - More reflection. I had the feeling, the essay would mostly only describe what happened or how the mechanics are working in the background of the game.
2. What is the key strength of this reflection?
Firstly, thanks for the clear structure! It makes reading in correspondence to the provided questions a lot easier. ;)
Secondly, the idea of a more complex insurance systems is great!</div>
