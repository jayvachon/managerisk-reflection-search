    <h1>Submission 293 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3861089, session_user_id: 0d0efd90a4efa9b9b7a5ad193a567872af4792e3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to make the player take the responsibility in the game to handle the funds at their disposal, judiciously and reduce the adverse effects of damage(caused due to  comet crash and flood).<br /><br />Through this game, I got the basic sense of how to take risks by keeping in mind the worst possible outcomes and preparing for them well in advance.As i played the game over and over again, i came to the realisation that investing in insurance was the best way to go about the game since it helped me enormously to reduce the damage caused by various factors and i didn't have to fork out alot of money in repairing the damages since most of it was already covered.Preparation for risks paid in huge amounts- by researching the path of the comets, I was able to decide how much to invest on the development of the pods and how much damage these pods would undergo depending upon the 'severity' and 'chance of hit' of the comet.Researching and insurance went hand in hand with development and helped me to create and develop my planet more than i could have ever done without these assets at my disposal.<br /><br />After playing the game again and again , I learnt that investing in insurance was worth every penny as it prepared me to tackle the aftereffects of the damage with less adversity. As i replayed the game over and over, I also realised he techniques to tackle the comets and reduce the damage caused by them by researching each and every one of them keeping in mind the severity of damage they were to cause in case they would 'hit' my planet.As I entered the higher levels of the game,I  understood the fact that <br />it was better to be prepared for the floods by raising the pods to a higher level in the early stages of the game itself.The last but not least technique which helped me to get through this game was to be careful while developing pods, by not creating too many of them during the initial levels, instead developing the few created ones so that the damage caused would not be too severe and easily repairable.This way I was able to manage my territory well enough.What i learnt most from this game is that- in order to achieve maximum in life,it is essential to take risks,not just jump into any new venture that may seem appropriate, but instead take calculated risk which may result in massive profits.<br /><br />If I got the chance to create a better version of this game,there would be quite a few changes that I would like to make,the most important being the chance to invest into weapons, which would be a one time investment, but would provide huge help in destroying the comets which may be posing a threat to the planet. I would also enhance the game experience from the same level and not starting the game from the beginning altogether.According to me,these changes would indulge the players into the game even more.<br /><br /> <br /></div>
