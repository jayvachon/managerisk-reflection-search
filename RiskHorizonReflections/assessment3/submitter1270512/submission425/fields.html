    <h1>Submission 425 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1270512, session_user_id: 7c2bb738d51f7f46b3bcf64d904e08e0bc7e370f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game, it was the most important to handle preparation for risk and dont let meteors to damage your community. I played it two times and in the second attempt I decided to purchase only 33% insurance every round, because I found out, that it too expensive and I rather spent my money to preparation and building and upgrading my pods and community. And further I found out, that I dont have to spend all my money to make the best protection for my community, but I rather decided to make a research every time a new meteor appeared in the sky. When there weren't any meteors, I focused only on building new pods and upgrading them to make more profitable community and my protection was average. <br /><br />1. Preparation for risk affect development after some time, especially, when more big meteors (it means meteors with large probability of hit and large severity) came in the same time.  In this game was the role of risk management very important, becaus without preparation it would lead to many shocks and the community could not be developed. I described my choices above this answer.<br /><br />2. Like I wrote above, i didnt buy the most expensive insurence every time, but only the cheapest one, because when I realized, that if I take care about preparation very well, I dont have to have any damage on my pods. Second time, I didnt try to make the perfect protection, but only to the point, that was required. It was necessary to check the severity of every meteoir and make a lot of research if some of them had significantly higher severity then my actual protection.  I learned from this game, that preparation, research and  insurance are more important that i thought and it is convenient to invest my money into that, even when it is not easy to implement in real world. I will think about that in my life.<br /><br />3. I would definitely add some information about upgrades. When I played this game, I didnt know, whether I should prefer to build a new pod or upgrade one of the existing ones. And I would make text tutorial too, because when i wanted to find one sentence from tutorial, i didnt want to play the whole tutorial one more time.<br /><br />That is all. <br /><br />Thanks for a game and very instructive course to its creators. <br /></div>
