    <h1>Submission 1493 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2193055, session_user_id: caa3ef7ce271d495a2b8afd61a5ad756f84f5a8f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management was firstly learning the about the level of damage most likely to be cause by disaster and taking necessary precautions by trying by leveling preparedness with the probable damage. A strategy was protecting against the worst possible hit since you never know when it will come, the slowly developing, and researching about possible damage. Should the damage be more than anticipated buy insurance to reduce my cost of rebuilding. Preparing for risk slowed down development immediately but in the long run the costs seemed to decrease and development picked up speed.<br /><br />After the first play i changed the strategy from trying to develop quickly but raising the protection level before developing. The main thing i learned was never to under estimate possible disaster, always prepare for the worst if you can afford to.<br /><br />A change i would propose is to differentiate the cost of insurance and protection depending on the location of in the development, in the game the cost near the shore line should be different from those away from the shore line because the damage will not be the same when a disaster hits.</div>
