    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is probably the good connection achieved between the key messages of the course and the game itself. However the suggestion for improvement part seems could have been better if the writer understood the question more accurately. The writer mostly talks about suggestions for improvement regarding user(in this case, game player's) experience rather than improving the game's ability to represent real life risk management situations. To refresh one's memory, the original question was this: "What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?" Still overall, one captured the most key lessons in a very concise language. Job well done!</div>
