    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">    First of all, I would like to thank for this amazing opportunity to learn the role of risk management via a simple game. I am not sure I would have understood the concept of risk management this well by reading reading a few pages of the text. Now to the address the first question, due to risk management the severity of the impact was reduced. When i put in more effort to manage the risk I was able to reduce the damage and keep the meter green. At the same time I realized there was a lot to do and i was confused where to build a new pod or monitor the comet or protect. I figured out i had to balance all three at a balanced level in order to succeed. The preparation for risk management did not have an immediate impact on development, but without any preparation, development would have been hindered drastically. <br /><br />    To answer the second question, I would have to agree I was not very good at this game. I lost in my first couple of attempts. Then i learnt from my mistakes and was finally able to clear level 1. In my very first attempt, I gave more attention to building the pods and upgrading them and failed to gain knowledge and protect from the comet. Thus when the comet hit without any preparation the impact the hit was high, the meter dropped low drastically and recovery took more time. Later I paid more attention to the comet and spent time for research and protection, this way the impact was very less or even null. I was able to successfully keep my meter green even though this time I had a fewer pods, I was able to save them. From this, I inferred that concentrating on the development alone without taking care of risk management does not lead to any real development. In that case even a small hit has a vast impact reversing all the development.<br />   <br />    A small change I would like to add to this game is that I would introduce different types of risks and vary the importance of the risk. Usually, we face different types of risks at the same time. After thoroughly analyzing the risk we need to prioritize the risk. This task of prioritizing the risk is not an easy task and one of the first steps in risk management. We cannot protect ourselves from all the risks, but at least know which risk will have the worst effect on us and try to reduce that impact. From this game it is very clear that there is no developement without risk management.   </div>
