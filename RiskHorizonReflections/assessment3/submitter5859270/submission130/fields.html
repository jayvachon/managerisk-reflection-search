    <h1>Submission 130 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5859270, session_user_id: 3dfd932427d13348fcaef35eb61408f1d5144388)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Week 2 Game Reflection</div><div><br /></div><div>This game allowed me to apply the analytic framework introduced in the class,</div><div>in a very simple setting. While the scenario was simple, the game allowed me to </div><div>apply all the elements of the risk framework, namely, knowledge,</div><div>insurance, protection, risk taking and industry.</div><div> </div><div>First time I played I did not have a clue what was happening and</div><div>why they were happening. Real world is uknowable in its entirity and future</div><div>is and always unknowable. Life and any endeavor in a comples world is always </div><div>risk prone and unpredictable. We do not always know everything we need to know.<br />This game forced me to operate in a competitive world with imperfect information.</div><div><br /></div><div>Then, I devoted some time to how to play and I related to the following dimensions of the </div><div>game: a limited time, predictably ticking down to zero, limited number of credits, </div><div>unpredicatable comet events, insurance, repair, recover, coping and resource allocation.</div><div>Based on this knowledge, I bought insurance, to protect in the event the comets </div><div>destroyed my asset (pod).</div><div><br /></div><div>I realized buying insurance dampened the effect of destruction after a comet crashed.</div><div>How I spent the time also mattered I could focus on the comet as they moved or</div><div>spend that time building the pods. </div><div><br /></div><div>This was also an exercise in Resource allocation. Maintaining a healthy reserve to pay for </div><div>repairs and recover from damage is essential. Buying too many pods without reserve slowed </div><div>down recovery. This is very similar to "emergency fund" or a rainy day fund. Maintaining</div><div>a healthy reserve prevented us from deploying all the resources at hand (100% utilization is not<br />achievable and it is not effective in the long run) however, in the event of a calamity </div><div>the emergency fund allowed me to quickly recover and resume growth. Buying protection in the </div><div>form of insurance allowed me to limit the damage due to unpredictable events and gracefully cope with</div><div>the aftermath.</div><div>Then I tried to identify the factors that affect the outcome.</div><div>Where I bought the pod "location of the pod", did not appear to have any impact on the damage.</div><div>I did not have to consider geographical diversity. It is possible I might have fared well in </div><div>an example involving capital markets but the unfamiliarity of the game reinforced the value of</div><div>learning and knowledge. I can see how this game could have a constructive effect</div><div>on farmers and people without exposure to capital markets to quickly understand the value of</div><div>protection, knowledge, insurance, coping, risk taking, resource allocation.</div></div>
