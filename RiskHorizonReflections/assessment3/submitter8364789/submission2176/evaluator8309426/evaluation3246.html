    <div class="field-value">Good discussion and reflection on the different approaches you might take to risk management in the game, having had a chance to experience it and good comprehension of a number of the concepts. There are, however, some areas where the explanation is confusing. For example, the reflection says "By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit" - but insurance does not reduce the change of being hit. Instead, it reduces the cost of repairing damages, and does this by being able to transfer resources from "good times" to more difficult times (this part is described accurately in the reflection). </div>
