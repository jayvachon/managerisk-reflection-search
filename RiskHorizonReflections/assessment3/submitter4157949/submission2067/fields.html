    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.Risk is the key element in the games.
Once your risk get out of control all your development will be in vain I use
the insurance the most cause it is cover up the most serious catastrophe with
cost of money. Knowledge not works in predicting the future but not to avoid it.
It works in the circumstance of less horrible disaster. Protection works the
best, however the price I paid to get the protection is the money and the
development which is frustrating. Preparation works not only immediately but also
after some time. Insurance pay you back right away and the money you deposit
works for your reconstruction.</p><p><span>  2.If  I  play it once ,I will do it in a aggressive way
which makes development more important than protection.</span></p><p><span> If  I
did it more than once.I will try to balance the protection with development in
the first two rounds which could results in great leap of development .</span></p><p>The game is hard to understand. I tried it
for more than 20 times, still get the result I wanted. The disaster is
unpredictable. DO NOT TAKE TOO MANY PRECAUTIONS! GET READY DEAL WITH IT WHEN IT
COMES.</p><p>







</p><p><span>3.  In
terms of money, If I can get loan from the others. It will help me built a more
fortified neigh hood. I lived in china, The rural areas of china is in the
extremely poverty level. The government does not extend enough help those
areas. The knowledge support is mainly by the volunteers and the finical
support is even rare. Once the loan could be extended to those areas we can
certainly help those people there have a better life.</span></p></div>
