    <h1>Submission 1452 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6931590, session_user_id: 4d0ecc65aefc7a446e8b139165b17f8a3b704b54)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">With regards to the role of risk management in the game, regardless of the path that you choose, development, insurance or protection, you immediately realize that all these path require resources. One of the things you can learn from this simulation is that a balance between the three is important for sustainability.<br /><br />I have only played the game once, and I was able to reach level 6. I'm not sure I would do anything differently this time. The game was not that challenging, still it was difficult even though you had to manage only 3 dimensions of risk, and only worry about one resource ($) which was easy to get and not affected by many socio-economic internal/external factors. It make you ponder on what is the decision chain in a real life scenario.<br /><br />If I could add one thing to the game:<br />a) I would add occurrences of random events like: strikes, financial crisis, resources boom, discovery of new technologies etc. which would affect the $ resource or prompt YES/NO choices which would affect the outcome of the game<br /><br />b) I would add more types of calamities that would require different types of insurance (you would still be able to get a more expensive all-cover insurance) and different types of protection.<br /></div>
