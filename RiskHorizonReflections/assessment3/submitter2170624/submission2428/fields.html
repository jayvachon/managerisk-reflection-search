    <h1>Submission 2428 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2170624, session_user_id: 41459522b652fa63e6aea9e15a0f7d1c72e0ef40)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management is part of daily life as we continuously make trade off either to reduce losses or to harness opportunities. The game offered a scenario where we build to prosper but there are challenges thrown in the way. The value that we may loose
from the impact was not given (as in number), but understood when there was an impact as we lose pods (property). In the game, the most important value that risk management gave, in my point of view, is that to choose the trade off among the risk management
option. Some options are very effective but can be very expensive in terms of money or time. Main trade offs were among the time and money. I would put more efforts in insurance. Here to me insurance is important as I am protecting financial value. Knowledge
is also important but sometimes the risk (meteor) came so fast, time to gather knowledge was not available. I did invest too much time on knowledge gathering. I would still do but I will do that if I see that very few risks are coming and I have time.
I would rather invest in insurance and keep upgrading it. Time is also very important. Decision timing helps to take effective decision. If I have less time, it is better I save the value at risk (financial, life etc.). I would bring the value at risk
in the decision making. For example, if the severity of impact is high, the value at risk (100% of 3 pods = 600) should be shown in the option. It could have been put like one chart saying this option costs this but saves that much etc. We cannot put
number for human life. But when decision makers needs to take decision or they face trade off or they have develop policy, they need to know how much or what is at stake. This may not be applicable for life or education, but when we see property being
damaged, putting number on an item can help taking decision.</div>
