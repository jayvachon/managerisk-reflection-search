    <div class="field-value">Your reflection is very clear and comprehensive on the tradeoff between insurance and building activities, and also the importance of research and protection (when times get worse). It is very interesting how you relate all this to real life. While you reflect on the importance of protection, I missed in your reflection an evaluation of the pros and cons of research versus protection in general. Most of the time you had to chose between spending your time on holding the protection key (right below) or on researching the asteroid approaching. As you clarified, research could give you the opportunity to have more time (after impact of an asteroid) to create 'connections' which also increased your protection / minimizing the damage of impact (just for that impact once). Investing your resources in protection generally costs more time, but helps on the long term (not only once). Your reflection did not make clear what your strategy was to that tradeoff.
