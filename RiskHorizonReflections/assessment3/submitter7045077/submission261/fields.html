    <h1>Submission 261 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7045077, session_user_id: 6ffa5cc91c0d16b8f3eed52ab557f65a90bb1c07)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management played several roles within the game.  The player needs to determine a balance of taking risk to develop the community against the uncertain external risks posed by comets/water damage.  From researching potential comet impact (knowledge), allocating wave protection costs and finally determining appropriate insurance coverage, the player must balance risks and opportunities according to available resources.  These choices force trade-offs between development, conservation of resources for insurance and rebuilding while providing protection and information gathering.  Preparation played a major role in managing risk and opportunity as purchasing insurance and mitigating comet risk were critical to moving forward in development and higher levels of achievement.  The roles of risk management were present in all aspects of the game and a key requirement of a player's success in managing development.  The game also showed that it is helpful to learn from experience to effectively mitigate risk while engaging opportunities.  


After playing the game a couple times, it became apparent that while developing pods, it was critical to address incoming comets as these produce damage that consumes resources and time to recover.  It is especially necessary to allocate time to protecting against comet strikes while finding suiting timing to continue development of the community.  I learned that the elements of risk and opportunity needed to be balanced to ensure successful, sustainable development.  In particular, it was far more beneficial to address comet strikes as they occurred rather than attempt to rebuild and repair after strikes.  The time and cost needed to recover far exceeded the costs to prepare and address comets and flooding as they occurred.  Preparation was key to successfully navigating the development in the risk environment.  


If I were to propose any changes to the game in a new version, I think it would make sense to assign varying levels of risk to different development locations.  For example, properties located closer to the water would require increased risk tolerance, insurance and recovery costs.  Further, I would recommend differing insurance rates for different properties.  These suggestions would likely complicate the game's clear message of risk management but would perhaps mirror risk management in a manner more aligned with actual practice.  Overall, I think the game is a good representation of risk management and the functions of research, protection and insurance as they relate to development.  The concept works well as an interactive exercise to demonstrate these principles and their context in a simulated environment.</div>
