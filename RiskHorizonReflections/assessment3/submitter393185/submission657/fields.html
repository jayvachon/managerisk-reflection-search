    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">My role in the game of risk management was to protect a community which is affected by falling comets careen into the water and causing waves that affects the development of the valley, I made several choices because I tried three times the game, at the very beginning of the game my first attempt was to  trade off the knowledge by the insurance and protection, later in my second try I attempted to change the insurance and focus only on protection and rise the island level to the highest one, and I think that one was the best option because I won the Third level which was my highest score, and the Third time my trade-off was to put all my money on the protection and knowledge rather than in insurance, because of that strategy I won the second level. The way of affectation in development was some time after the risk preparation and because of that I did not hit the m√≠nimum level in order to continue with the next level. I thing that at this time I am not able to take a safety and serious risk management real case.

The main things that I learned from the game, were to learn how to manage the time at the same time that money because about risk management everything has a cost in life and we have to put on risk some things, for instance I learned from the game that the larger the community is the more expensive that becomes because protecting short communities is better, cheaper, and you have more probability to save more people, that`s why I decided in my second attempt to built the community up only with two houses. Another thing that I learned from the game was that making some connections with another pods and getting more knowledge about comets we could make more time in order to identify them, and also diminishing the uncertainty on how a comet may cause damage.

I would add a simple thing in the game that is make more accurate the knowledge, protection and insurance in real life, I mean, adapting that situation to a real life scenario in which we can identify not only the damage cause by a natural disaster, but viewing the cost of the damage, the human beings affected, those things that usually an organization reports after a natural disaster, but basically the game teaches us how to prevent a disaster, talking on risk either insurance, deaths, knowledge, protection, or others aspects in risk management in order to overcome a disaster and getting the less damage.
