    <div class="field-value">You correctly identified time and money as constraints and describe inmprovements to your strategy between games. The addition of agriculture is a good example of how to improve the game.
To improve this reflection, you could write in predictions with your new strategies instead of "will prioritise insurance to upgrades and see what happens". Also you omitted the important use of time in researching comets to use community connections. these are just ideas, nice work otherwise!</div>
