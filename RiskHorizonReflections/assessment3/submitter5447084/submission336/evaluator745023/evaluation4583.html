    <div class="field-value">This reflection captures well the experience of role-playing a risk manager. Highlighting more the trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection, and insurance and how did you alter their contribution in managing the risk as you played additional rounds would potentially improve the reflection. Another element that could be added is the time dimension of decisions (e.g., development ,protection and coping take certain time to materialize).</div>
