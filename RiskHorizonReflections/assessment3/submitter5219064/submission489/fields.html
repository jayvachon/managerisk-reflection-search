    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>Reflections
on Riskhorizon game:</strong></p><p>I found
that the role of risk management in the game was to diversify your resources, both
money and time, by making protection (which require both time and money),
buying insurance, making development and investigation (knowledge). I found
that there were a large tradeoff between protection and damage that occur, so this
was a big important aspect, but the time was very scarce to some point. Further
to this there is a tradeoff between either buying a large insurance or
investing money in protection. Apart from this spending time on knowledge is a
tradeoff by making less protection. So it all matters how you diversify your resources
between the risk management tools to develop your country and make money for
further development. They are all interconnected so it is not possible to just
use one risk management tool. If you focus too much on one risk management tool
it will influence the other and you might suffer from disasters or not getting
development.</p><p>I played
the game more than once. The first time I spend too much money on large incurrence
which resulted in too few money to development in the start. The second time I
made few but large development investments which did not give enough prosperity
to get to next level. The strategy I found to be best was to start out with
many small developments (new houses), spend much time on investigation/get knowledge
and a small amount of protection. Just before the first meteor strikes buy the
cheapest insurance and at last use all extra time you have to raise the
protection level (which you might say is to use the pre invested time and
money). From this strategy it is possible from the second level reduce any disaster
to a minimum or nothing at all when a meteor strikes. I found out that it is
very important to diversify your resources. It is not possible to just focus on
development without taking risk management into account. Further to this you
have to use all risk management tools. I does not help to just focus protection
without having knowledge and knowledge is useless if you do not use it by
making protection. And at last it can be very costly not having insurance.</p><p>The game
was quit fun to start with, but rather quickly got boring after a few
rounds/levels, but was a god way to illustrate risk management. If I should develop
a new version I would add some make some kind of progress/ new things from
level to level. For instance some technology you can invest in to make other
kinds of protections. Another thing is that buying insurance just before a disaster
occurs if often not possible in real life (maybe you can buy an insurance if
you see a storm approach in the weather forecast? But many other natural disasters
you cannot predict like this).</p><p>







</p><p><span>Living in
Denmark it is difficult to reflect on the risk management that is represented
in this course as there are no big natural disasters, drought, earth quake or
the like. But over the resent years there has occurred some large rainfall (in Danish
scale). On aggregate level there has to be made investments and investigation
of water drain to get the water away from the low landscape areas. On individual
level people/households has to review their insurance and maybe upgrade these. Houses
with basement might need to get better protection from floods.</span></p></div>
