    <h1>Submission 2483 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5804757, session_user_id: 3c3e2f9a3a40aa057c6e8d0cfa8e413e06ea65b7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Whilst the game provides a basic understanding
of the necessity and important of balancing all the options available on the
table, trade-offs for want of a better expression, it portrays a particularly
superficial approach to risk management. Having played the game three times (one
of which the game was completed only to announce a ‘fatal error’ - perhaps an
ironic indication that the role of RM is never complete as shocks are never likely
to disappear altogether) it soon became apparent that ‘early development’ is
the trump card. Initially, based on a desire to be a
holistic and benign illuminator for my minions I attempted to balance
development, physical defence enforcement and knowledge. This consisted of
spending whenever money was available on everything. Spending your way out of a
crisis indeed. Result: level three collapse as the goal was not reached. I
concluded that an over cautious risk strategy impedes development and as such
overall goals were not achieved due to a lack of revenue generation. Therefore,
it is necessary to focus on the protection of growth as the central (but not
only) tenant of success in risk management.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>On the second attempt, finances were
primarily spent on development consequently placing research as a secondary
expense and insurance as a luxury for the latter stages (ie. When there was
actually something to protect). A process unfolded as follows: the greater the
level of development the faster the income stream became subsequently making
disaster mitigation easier. As such, with greater wealth accumulation came an
increased capacity to purchase top-end insurance, max-out research and improve
the physical defences. These actions would also be used more discriminatorily,
allowing for tailored responses to particular threats. The conclusion this time
was that development is key. The earlier the area develops, the easier it is to
mitigate against potential risks as finances can be redistributed to areas of
need (notwithstanding an early cataclysmic event of course!). Sadly, this does
suggest why countries in the ‘Western world’ are better equipped to deal with
disasters; as former leaders of industry <i>and</i>
former colonial powers these nations had an incredible head start, and as such,
are able to invest in mitigation procedures without it being at the expense of
societal development.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>My suggestion for improvement(s)
rests with the implementation of centralised application of development and
risk management. Although the game highlights the integral importance of centralised
actors, it does so in a particularly superficial way. It assumes that
governments are the sole driver of both development and risk management. As
such, the scenario is entirely dependent on what is assumed to be governmental
ability to provide resources and protection for it's populous. But this implicitly
assumes the application of will, something that isn't particularly forthcoming
in reality. In fact, in my opinion is a fatal assumption of the game. It would
be beneficial to introduce external actors both within (citizens) and beyond (banking
industry) the centralised authority’s control that have the capacity to either
undermine or enhance the risk management and development options.  An example of one such addition would be to
introduce financial organisms such as banking institutions that interact with
the central authority in a number of ways including providing loans, needing
bailouts and recalling loans. In essence, adding further stress and development
levers.</span></p>
