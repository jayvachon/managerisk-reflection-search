    <h1>Submission 180 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1111881, session_user_id: b00ab3c20928847b2cd02cfc4bd187dbcc2c09fc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I failed the game twice after playing it 4 times, 2 of each
for both levels. The second time I played level one, I spent more on research,
which saved me from huge losses after the shocks. Each time I played, I spent
huge amount buying insurance. Sometimes it helped but other times it didn’t. </p><p>Something I learned from the game is that doing research and
repairing quickly on risk management are important. I don’t quite see the power
of knowledge here because the shocks are pretty much un-preventable. I feel that
building at the right time to avoid huge chances of getting hit is helpful but
it’s totally out of my control. </p><p> </p><p>To sum up, the role of risk management in the game is to set
up prevention, coping and rescue mechanisms so that we can minimize losses. The
second and third time I played the game, I invested more on research and
insurance. As a result, it cost me more but reduced the damage. Preparation happened
immediately the shocks worked more effectively. </p><p> </p><p>When I played the game the second time, I tried to build
less pods but updated them more frequently. Because the bigger the community
is, the more money and much longer time it costs to repair. </p><p> </p><p>
































</p><p>My new design of the game would be to add a function with
which I can evacuate (or move) the pods. If I can, I’d also like to add a
function with which I decide whether to repair the pods or to tear it down and
build a new one. </p></div>
