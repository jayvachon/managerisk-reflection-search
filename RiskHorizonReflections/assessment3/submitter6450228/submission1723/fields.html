    <h1>Submission 1723 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6450228, session_user_id: ac6f2915f416d1b0e61090506f5f9a13ee4770f5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.</p><p>There’s a constant trade-off in the game between developing and protecting the community. It was important to take risks and invest
on property, while accurately navigating hazards and investing only on the necessary precautions.
</p><p>2.</p><p>I played the game nearly a dozen times, and learned to not spend more than I needed to on protection and how to take
more calculated risks. In the beginning, I invested heavily in the highest
degree of insurance and protection.The costs of
repairs are lower when there are more clients pool the risk. It was cheaper to repair the less expensive properties. In the course of the game, it becomes
clear that the point is to match the possible damage that could be inflicted by
a comet to the level of protection and insurance, at the right time.</p><p>(In the course of playing, mostly I improved because I understood
the controls of the game better, so I understood that I had to hold the
protection button long enough to match the risk level associated with comets. )<br /></p><p>For the sake of class discussion, many of the points raised in
chapter 2 of the report are illustrated. Risk management involves planning and resiliance,
and we do this with knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping.  </p><p>3.</p><p>



























</p><p>Variables
and probability are big obstacles, so I would introduce more variables. For example, annual rainfall is largely unpredictable and can have a
huge range of secondary impacts over time. Where I live in California, there is
currently a drought, and it influences our daily lives, from how we use it in
our homes to the price of food. </p><br /></div>
