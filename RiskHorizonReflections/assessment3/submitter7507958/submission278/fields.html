    <div class="field-value"><strong>Risk - My understanding.</strong><br /><br />I really love paying game. let it be xbox or computer games. When i started playing this game i feel too boring and waste of time. I could not complete level 1 also. so i thought i am a guy who plays a lot of game so how can i loose such a easy game. then i tired again and again . I could not clear level 1.  I stopped  said to my self this is not going right i have to give in more efforts in understanding.  awhhh!  i saw my mistake i was not uplifting the community of mine. i mean to say i was only building my home and buying insurance to support my home. i was seeing a value in uplifting the community to  and take our land where many of us have a home . There was a technology on the island ie we could life our land after spending some amount of money.  <br />             I started to concentrate on it. I also started to see the vulnerability of each planet hitting . before hitting i use to see the severity of it.  According i learn the value of buying insurance and increasing the insurance to a level better.  The first level started building community. not only my home but  neighbors home and garden and flowers . I started buying insurance from  level one. i buyed 33 insurance cover as i started to build my community.  I also started investing time in taking the land above sea level. i started to take care of it and learn to help each other.<br />               In level one i was hit thrice with risk off losing it all but as i learn you can't only take of your self, your home, your garden and your land. You have to think of the community and learn to help each other on it.<br />It took me time to understand these all things in a game, as i was playing for a fun.  The more i played more i was clear why i was playing the game.   Knowledge was important as afterr playing more then 5 times i understood the imp of insurance and protection.  <br />            As i played more then once i understood the importance of protection ie lifting the land up using the latest technology in the game.  the protection played a important role of me to go level up.  Without protection i could not have completed the game at all.  This mistakes i was doing again again. But at last i learn lot of things from the game.<br />If was given opportunity to add some new features. i would like to add pop message after i lost ie Protection is important in community u did not try it. Try it again  <br /><br /></div>
