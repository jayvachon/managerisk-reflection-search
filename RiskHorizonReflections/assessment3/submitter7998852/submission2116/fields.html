    <h1>Submission 2116 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7998852, session_user_id: cfd26bece10f2f761bd269e7d463cfaea14febb5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>

</p><p>On the game the risk management was key for to
reach the top levels, by administrating tools like research, insurance and protection,
combining them in the best way as possible for to prevent and manage the risk
of the comet clash. </p><p>

</p><p><span><span>At first my strategy was to invest the most on
the buidings construction and protection, with almost not investment on
research and just very little on insurance,  but I kept loosing even when my city was large
developed not because a comet impact but because of  the bar of development was not on the mark, I
really didn´t understand why at all, so I think  the absent of research looking the comets was
the problem and researching was then a must, I noticed the left bar grew faster
with research, then in my final game I did strong inversion on protection and
research, while keeping the buildings at high growing rate updating them as
soon as I could but only few at a time and not all at once as I was pretending
at the beginning. I eventually bought insurance at 4</span>th level but it
was not necessary because really highs levels of protection were achieved. In
conclusion the best combination for me was to invest strong on protection and
research for to avoid damage, and keep the city buildings updating. </span></p><p>

</p><p>That shows to me that in real life is very desirable
to do research and adquire enough knowledge for to prevent, control and content
the problem, generating the correct strategy of protection with that information,
a city with no research and no idea of prevention strategies is in high risk
and can be easily damaged, to invest on prevention also decrease the need of
insurance to a second place.</p><p>

</p><p><span>There are floods on my city but there are also
strong earthquakes and they happen really often,  which I believe could be also used for
representing risk on games like this, because we also need to improve our
knowledge, build better and stronger buildings and be prepared with insurance
and emergency plans when this happens. 
Maybe it could be an interesting idea to make the game more complex by
adding several types of risk that can happen at any time and not only comets,
then insurance will be more useful than it actually is in the present version
of the game.</span></p><p><span>
