    <h1>Submission 187 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6308266, session_user_id: f3bc9b89c5cc7b293f776413fe5cb23c2145daa4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of the risk management game showing how leveraging the strategy of development against risk helps us reduce adversary impact when odds occur and take advantage of the opportunity it present. The trade off is between whether the severity of the lost is acceptable or not , and whether protection or insurance is the best options depends on the likelihood of the disasters. in this game, knowledge helps to predict the likelihood of risk, which helps us make the appropriate inform decision. Preparation for risk also consider timing as well. Where the likelihood and severity of the disaster are small , it's would be waste to use available cash to carry out insurance or build protection early where it could depreciate over time. <br /><br />I have played the game more than one times. After each time, I learnt the key of successful development lie in timing of the decision . It also helps me have the better understand of the scale of severity and likelihood of the game , there for make more informed decision accordingly. <br /><br />The game itself is very well thought out and definitely helps me appreciate the theories I learnt in risk lecture more. If I would change anything to the game, I would make research and development to be incremental rather that restart from zero each time. As in real life, once technology innovation occur, it doesn't go backwards. In development, once the techniques, and know how is known, it couldn't only get better, and in very exceptional rare circumstances where the innovation is completely destroyed and need to restart from scratch. <br /><br />Coursera code : wUArCmj<br /></div>
