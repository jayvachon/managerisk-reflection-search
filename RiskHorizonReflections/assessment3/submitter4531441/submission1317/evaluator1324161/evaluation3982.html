    <div class="field-value">I appreciate the way my peer has tied learnings from the videos to his reflection on the game.  Her/his understanding of the course material and how it is 'tested' through the game is clear through his reflection.  She/he talks about the trade-offs that one needs to make as a risk manager, and how although it may appear simplistic at start, it is neither a binary choice nor simple.

It would have been better to play the game again and pressure test the reflection by following a non-conservative approach, and reach a deeper level of understanding of the systems.</div>
