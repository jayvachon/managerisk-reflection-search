    <h1>Submission 2325 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1023902, session_user_id: 7bbd6f9a13b308bbec715e8ab2c5b627838e6d81)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Development is Risk Horizon's ultimate
objective. To reach optimized development, however, one needs to manage risks
effectively. In Risk Horizon, the mechanics of development is quite easy - you
build, and you get more money to build more. The risk management aspect, on the
other hand, is more interesting. Risks (the comets) come apparently in random
intervals and in varied speed, probability, and magnitude. The first trade-off
for me is to prioritize and schedule risk management - I may choose to ignore
some risks, to focus on single risk, or to spread my attention across multiple
risks. After choosing the risks to manage, I had to balance how much to time to
spend to learn about each risk, how much resources to spend on protection, and
what kind of insurance to purchase. Generally, good knowledge about a risk plus
good protection level eliminates the need for insurance. Insurance is helpful
when risks come too quickly that there was not enough time to learn about it
and to protect myself against it. Resources spent on risk management will delay
development. The benefits come when we are able to cope with shocks either
without loss or with minimal loss - otherwise I would have to spend significant
resources and time to recover from losses. <span><br /><br />
Risk
Horizon did a good job in abstracting real life risk management into a fun and
engaging game. It teaches that the balancing of risk management and growth
leads to maximized development. An optimal balance of prioritization, learning,
protection, and insurance leads to effective risk management. <br /><br />
When I
first played Risk Horizon, I tended to focus on growth. I failed to reach level
6 as I was subsequently hit by a few comets and sustained damages that deterred
my development. In my second try, I became defensive. I coped with all damages
well, but I failed reaching my development goal. I tried the game a few more
times (approximately 2 hours) with different strategies before finally
completing level 6. Over these trials, I 1) learned to prioritize based on the
speed and magnitude of risks, 2) learned the relationship between learning, the
time for community connection, and their bolstering effect to protection, 3)
learned the effect of insurance, and 4) learned that risk preparedness takes
practice - e.g. the more I played, the faster I am able to connect communities.
In my final trial where I completed level 6, I found that during the last 1.5
minutes, I had more resources than I could spend on developments. I was able to
buy the highest level of insurance and bolster into maximum protection. Still,
I had more resources to spend. In this respect, Risk Horizon reflects that
well-developed countries are in a virtuous cycle of better risk management and
accelerated development. <br /><br /><span>If I
am to add one simple thing to Risk Horizon, I will add variety to the mechanics
of development. The game will offer development types with different properties
like cost, profit/return horizon, rate of return, and comet damages tolerance.
Risk Horizon already does a great job in modeling risks. Adding variety to
development lets it model opportunities more realistically. I think this addition is
appropriate - in the context of our course's (World Bank's) definition, where
risk management manages risks to decrease losses and manages opportunities to
increase benefits.</span></span></p></div>
