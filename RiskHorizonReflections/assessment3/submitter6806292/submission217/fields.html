    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">First of all the Risk horizon was a wonderful game to study the strategies of risk taking. This may vary from person to person, as that is the nature of Risk. The role of risk management in the game was simply overwhelming as there as a lot of things that one has to care about for improving the city of Aloha. The  comets are a real piece of concern as there is another constraint in the form of timing for each level. So one has to properly  gain knowledge on construction of the Pods and upgrading them. The insurance also is a major concern since if we plan perfectly in developing the city with necessary research and upgrades there is no need for insurance. On the other hand insurance in worst case can help. In the case where one have to tilt the land in order to save the city from comet, the money kept on decreasing which hindered the development. Initially in the first and the second level i only opted for level 1 insurance since the impact of comet was limited and can be controlled with proper research. But when i moved on to the 3 level and so on , due to the time constraint i cannot do much research and so opted for level 3 insurance which covers 75 % of damage. This was the main step i took for protection.<br /><br />I played the game 2 times, and the first time due to inexperience i ended up in the third level. The next time i took some serious steps in order to develop the city at the same time to protect it and went on till the fifth round. The main concern i took was to build only 2 to 3 pods in the level 1 and upgrading them in the following levels. I then added up one pod for each level. The first time i played, due to lack of knowledge it built around 5 pods in the first round and ended up bankrupt. Then coming to protection as told earlier i dint waste money on opting for level 3 insurance in primary levels of the game. The idea about the research was very tough to understand initially. But after playing it the first time , i got how to proceed for the next time. I done research for those comets which had high severity and i neglected those which had less severity and chance of hit. So overall i learned how to tackle the situations in which there are many area of concerns to be looked after.<br /><br />Well if it comes to my concern on adding any change to the game, then i would recommend to introduce some special type of Pods. The special type of Pods in the sense, construction of those pods may require some higher cost when compared to the normal ones. These Pods are special because, i am incorporating some powers to those pods. The special pods can do research on the incoming comets on its own. This is because when i played the game, i dint have sufficient time to do research on every incoming comet. So if the player specifies a comet that have to be researched, then the special pods can take up the job and give the intended results. But on the other hand this special pods are high in cost to build, to upgrade and to repair when it is damaged. I got this idea from various steps taken by many countries around the world to set up some equipments or some special buildings to track the nature and the disasters forehand. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> </div>
