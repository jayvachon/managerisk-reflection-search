    <h1>Submission 1099 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5762423, session_user_id: ab9446a8bcd4fc9f2edb686b3f694a89e07a0f3a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span> In my opinion it gave us
a somewhat reality check on how to deal with uncertainties in this case the
meteors while achieving the objective of growing pods in  a limited time span. In order to meet the objective
and counter the risk three tools in the form of research, protection and
insurance were available. So when playing the game I opted for various
combinations first was dominated by protection and insurance but it was not
after long that I discovered that protection was too slow and did not match the
speed with which the meteors hit. Then I traded protection with knowledge and 75% insurance coverage. This combination worked really
well for me, occasionally I relied on protection but the most used tools in
my case were research and insurance. Initially in my case the
preparation for risk management was more of a trial and error however after
multiple re-tries it ensured development.</span></p><p>If I played the game only once,  I would have started by getting some knowledge but not too much (not
constantly doing research till the meteor is reached the water) followed by
protection and then lastly insurance whereby the percentage of insurance
coverage depending on the available resources but my aim would be to get 75%
coverage. If I played the game more than once which I did, I learned that doing
research should not be stopped till the time you are confident that the meteor
would not cause any damage and continue getting as much information about the
severity and chances of hit as possible. Then after evaluating the severity and
the chances of hit I would opt for insurance coverage followed by protection as
in my experience it was not of much use. There were quite a few things that I
learned from the game first of all the timing of using the tools, as each tool
can be used at a particular time like in the case of protection unless you
started it earlier as a precautionary tool it would not give to enough time to
raise the level and protect against the hit once the meteor appears. Similarly
gaining knowledge is an ongoing process and it is important to keep tabs on it
throughout the risk cycle as new research might suggest a change in the level
of severity or chances of hit and eventually guide you to make a smart move.
Another important lesson was that insurance coverage is vital as an individual
would find it extremely difficult to bear the entire loss if some of the risk
is covered it gives a bit of confidence to plant more pods/ take risky options
without the fear of losing it all.</p><p><span>If I could change one thing I would give the player an option to
buy a meteor shooting machine which would cost around $600 and can only be purchased
once to shoot up to 5 meteors. I live in the Islamabad, Pakistan
where recently a new mass transit system has been started the project is one of
the promises made by the ruling party in its election manifesto however due to
the nature of the project entire city has been uprooted and lately a young boy
fell in one of the wholes dug for the project and died. Now under these
circumstances it would be much better if the government ran advertisements for
locals in the print and electronic media informing them about the costs and
long-run benefits of the mass transit and also install additional resources to
in the form of sign boards, road blockades and lights. </span></p></div>
