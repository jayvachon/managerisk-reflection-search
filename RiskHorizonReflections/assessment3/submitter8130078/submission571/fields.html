    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Question
One:</b></p>

<p>Risk is real and should be managed; therefore there
should be a process in place to ensure that this is done. This is the greatest
lesson that I got from the game.</p>

<p>I had to know the kind of risk that I faced, the
likelihood of its occurrence and the severity: i had to strike a balance
between the resources and the protection measures I took. For shocks with the
most severity and high possibility of occurrence, I researched more and invested
quite a lot of resources to buy insurance. On the other hand, i ignored shocks
that have a high risk of occurrence but no severity on my community, as much as
I had spent time and resources to gain knowledge of their existence.</p>

<p>I made sure that I wasn’t caught up in the risk management
process and forget about development of my community, with the knowledge of
risks and insurance in place, I channeled my resources to development of new
structures and upgrade of existing ones. Preparation for risk on time meant
more resources for development in the long run.</p>

<p><b>Question
Two:</b></p>

<p>Having played the game twice, the second time I learnt
that I don’t have to invest so much resource on all risks. I learnt that I should
have knowledge of all risks but I should classify them based on the probability
of occurrence versus the impact. The impact is the most important as there some
risks that have a high probability of occurring but have no impact and thus
investing on them isn’t a priority, the converse is true.</p>

<p><b>Question
Three:</b></p>

<p><span>If I were to redesign the game I would incorporate a risk
element that brings about opportunities if well managed .Example, too much rain
(flooding) in an area. If well managed, the water can be channeled  to dry areas of the community for irrigation
purposes or be used to plant crops that do well in water logged areas e.g. rice.
The game has negative elements of risk and totally ignores the positive side of
risk.</span></p><span>
