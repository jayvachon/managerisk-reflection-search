    <div class="field-value">From my understanding, the key strength of this reflection is on Economic growth of the community. For example, where the reflection indicated that "When choosing to create a building I would add an option where you can choose the type of building. One type would be a residence type of building and the other a commercial type of building.By doing this you should develop both type of buildings wisely because you wouldn't want a large population with no jobs available. Also, their is a reflection of community development and community commitment where he explained that "to manage risk every individual should pay attention to his possible options"

This reflection would have been more better if there was any focus on coping.</div>
