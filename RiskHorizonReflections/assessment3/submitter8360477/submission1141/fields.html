    <h1>Submission 1141 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8360477, session_user_id: 8fd031696177b59a3db226f0f67947225781d467)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The first time that I played the game, I attempted to build
several pods and upgrade as quickly as possible, but my research quotient was
not very high and my insurance rate was only at 50% of potential loss. When a
meteor hit, I did not have sufficient time to repair my pods before the time
had expired.  I worked very quickly
to upgrade the pods as I could, but I needed to balance that with insurance,
repair, and research costs. My inclination was to turn to insurance as a way to
mitigate risk, rather than relying on research capacity. I attempted the game
several more times, but was unable to find the appropriate balance between
research, insurance, and upgrading to beat the level. </p>

<p>If I were to play again, I would invest in fewer pods, but
ensure that each pod was built to its maximum upgrade availability. My
expectation is that investing in this upgrade will allow superior performance
from the pods and minimal damage from advancing and damaging meteors. The research quotient
did not seem to add much to my score and would not be a priority for me.</p>

<p>If I could change one aspect of the game, I would add the
option to borrow funds from other locales with a relatively high interest rate. This would evidence the reality of needing to borrow from surrounding and/or altruistic countries and may need to be a last-resort, but realistic option in the game. </p></div>
