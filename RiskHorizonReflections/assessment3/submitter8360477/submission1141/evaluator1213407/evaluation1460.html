    <div class="field-value">Thank you very much for your reflection paper. Obviously, it shows that you learned quite a bit while playing this game. In particular, it seems you have come to understand the importance in striking a balance among investments for protection, insurance and research. Not clear whether you played the game more than one or not. However, some of your final reflections might need to be informed by more evidence. When you say that research added small value to your effort (presumably based on a few games), your conclusion seems to be in contract with what both specialized literature and the course  content itself seem to suggest. Likewise, your suggestion to borrow money from other altruistic countries seem to be a bit oblivious of the ongoing global reality where competition for development funding has become quite fierce. Also, looking for external funding might also introduce some more variables of risks and dependence in the medium- and long-term. Therefore, what I suggest is to make the limitations (if you see any) of your conclusions more explicit when presenting your arguments. Once again, thanks for your ideas and contributions. Good luck with your final project and the successful completion of this course!</div>
