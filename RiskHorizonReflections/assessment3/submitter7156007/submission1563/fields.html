    <h1>Submission 1563 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7156007, session_user_id: c3a60ff34f5f0754b322e495af9504537cc8bd23)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game was a pure Risk management game. The game teaches how a risk is managed in  time of problem,uncertainty. As the future is uncertain so risk is unavoidable. What we have to do is reduce the risk to as minimum as possible because risk can only be reduced, it cannot be completely avoided. The main things to manage in the game were :<br />1) Wealth,<br />2) Insurance,<br />3) Development meter,<br />4) Timing,<br />5) Up gradation,<br />6) Risk evaluation ( Severity of the meteors , Probability of hitting by the meteors)<br />7) Research, and <br />8) Community connections.<br /><br />A good choice of all these factors help in protection and thus help in development of an economy. <br /><br />I played the game multiple times and improved over each and every chance. Some of the learnings are:<br />1) Insurance play the most important role. Insurance <span>plays an important role in planning, leading, organizing, coordinating, and controlling the activities of Community both before a loss occurs ( pre-loss actions) and after a loss occurs (post loss) in an effort to minimize the adverse effects on Community at a reasonable cost.<br />2) Wealth is to be used judicially.<br />3) Research always pays.<br />4) A switch in time saves nine.<br />5) Connections among community are very important.<br /><br />The improvement in the game in the form of things which, I see, can reduce the probability of risk or can help in reducing it and help in coping risk in a better way are :<br /><br />1) More of wealth. Even if seen in a real world, wealthy economies can tackle risk in a better way because of the larger amount of resources available.<br />2) Cheap insurance.<br />3) Easy up gradation.</span></div>
