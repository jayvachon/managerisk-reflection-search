    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of rick management in the was we had to develop our city alongside comets attacking and causing damage. This hinders the progress of development, just like in the real world. I had to make important choices in terms of buying insurance and how much of it with the limited funds that i had. I also had to balance out my development in insuring there is equal development. <br /><br />I also had to do enough research on the risk i was about to face, in this case the comets. With enough research and knowledge i was able to prepare well to cope with the rich, in terms of raising the ground to meet the severity of the attack. The biggest trade-off i faced was to allocate enough funds into buying insurance and development. At the starting of the game, i was buying the highest insurance available and this slowed down development significantly. Later on into the game, i realized there was no need to buy the full insurance as i had learnt quite a bit on protection my development. I still purchased insurance but at a lower amount, just to be safe and be prepared about the risks i was about to face. <br /><br />I played the game once; and i would have done a few things differently. Firstly, i would have used more funds to focus on development rather than buying insurance. Secondly, I would also develop everything equally and evenly. and finally, i would have done more research to better prepare myself with the risk that i was about to face in the game. <br /><br />I have learnt, preparing for risks is vital in the success of a nation, community. there should be a strategic balance between development and preparing for the risks. i have also learnt to plan ahead and face the risk . Knowing or studying yhe risk we are about to face also helps with the aftermath of an event. <br /><br />If i was given the chance to change the game i would add more real life risks such as financial crisis is the form of reduced funds or slower progress. I would also add an aspect of defense or national security, in terms of allocation resources for military purpose. I would also enable allies  to be formed between countries to enhance development and success and also better equip ourselves with the risk we are about to face in the game.  </div>
