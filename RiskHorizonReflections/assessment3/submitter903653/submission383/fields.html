    <h1>Submission 383 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 903653, session_user_id: bba70d7669c8d89cb2b1f2fa8d84ee61a17f390d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management is about preventing or fight against the destroy of massive danger. a lot of choices and plans you have to be a good planner to prevent the risk you have. First you must have a knowledge about the risk you have from the previous experience that you passed before ,then try to protect your community by a lot of protections that depends on the risk you will confront (<i>the </i><span><i>comets that hit the pods in the game</i>). <br /><br />At the first time it wasn't different from later times ,I change the plan a lot of time but i think that if you have a small community don't waste your money in assurance just try to be </span>serious to have protection , you don't need to pay money for assurance because your community has only a small financial value, and of course if your community has a worth value you will pay for assurance to <span>reduce the amount of money you pay to fix the damages. <i>protect your community if it small , protect and pay for assurance if it big .<br /></i><br />As i played the game i found that the risk management skills you will not get it by chance because it is knowledge , if you don't have a good knowledge about risk management and how to prevent the losses , you will not have the power  to control the crises "<i>knowledge is power</i>", </span>the game can't describe the entire idea of risk management it is just an evidence to some definitions like protection, assurance , etc....  <span>.<br /><br />If i have the chance to be with the developing team , i wish i could make the game more realistic with a real crises and risk that make it not just a game , that will make it more helpful and skill to study the risk management , because when you have a real crises or natural disaster on focus you will learn more than if you only have a game with unrealistic fundamentals.<br /><br />Risk management is a point view of person you don't have the same ideas that anybody else have ,it is very personal opinion you should to be brave to take action .Once i played the game i think it's a must for every one in the world because we are all don't have the same ideas  and all of us passed and will pass a lot of risks personal risks , financial and natural </span>disasters . we should be ready for it <br /><br /><br /></div>
