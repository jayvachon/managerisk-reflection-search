    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game Risk Horizon, surprised me in a negative way, as i did not expect it to be as such. Although i understand the overall idea of the game i had problems with understanding the game itself and expressing my ability to make the right decision at the right time. In my opinion the game captured the ideas of risk management by providing you with a recurrent risk and also giving you the choices of insurance, upgrading for more protection and raising the level of the earth. The ability to study the meteors was another interesting addition to the game, as you could change your insurance if the research showed the the impact would be too hard. <br /><br />The first time i played the game it was a terrible loss and i did not make it through level one. My biggest mistake was me only buying the highest insurance and not thinking of upgrading and doing research. Later on, after understanding the game better i was able to compromise and thus upgrade my homes, but at the same time have a normal insurance. However, if the research showed that the risk was too high and the impact of the meteors would destroy the community, i would upgrade the insurance before the meteor hit so that i would have to use less cash to repair. As i learnt how to prepare for risk i was able to be better at developing the houses, using the money wisely, but also keeping an eye on the research and preparing for the hit. <br /><br />In conclusion i would say that the game was an interesting simple learning experience where i could see immediately the impact of a well thought risk management strategy. The times when i understood the recurrent threat and i was able to take measures to prevent it, were the times where i had the highest rate of success. Sometimes i took higher risks by deciding to continue upgrading without being insured properly and knowing of a high risk coming, and at times these decisions made me win and at times it made me loose. I think the game gave a better understanding in a simpler way of what risk management is and how we can use it even in the most virtual of spaces. </div>
