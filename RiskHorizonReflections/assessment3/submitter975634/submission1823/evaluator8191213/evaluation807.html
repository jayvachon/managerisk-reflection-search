    <div class="field-value">This is a solid reflection.  The author clearly appreciated what the game was trying to convey and took the time to play it multiple times.  I liked that they experimented a lot more than I did when I played the game.  When I played the game, I tried to just expand the community as much as possible.  This student took the time to try out many scenarios and it is clear that they valued the lessons that each scenario provided them.  I liked their idea of giving students the ability to save their results based on what they tried in each attempt.  This person has also been applying the knowledge that they've obtained from the reading material and applied it to their way of playing the game.  Nice job.  Keep it up.</div>
