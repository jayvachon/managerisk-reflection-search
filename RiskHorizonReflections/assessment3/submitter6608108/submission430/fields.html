    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>

The of risk management in the game consisted in evaluating how much damage 
could come from a falling comet.
This could be done evaluating the power of the coming comet with research, 
compared against the level of protection and insurance held. 
Given that the goal was to develop the ponds as much as possible to generate 
the maximum credit to pass on to higher levels, 
it was necessary to have all the pond in good states and well developed.
Research was very important to get ahead in the following levels, in order to 
decide wether to buy insurance or not. 
After playing the games many time, I realized that the best thing to do was 
to develop as much as possible and do a lot of research so that I could have 
the maximum number of pond in good state and I could decide if it was the case 
to buy insurance or not, when the coming comet was too risky(i.e. too damaging) 

The game showed that while development is important, 
it is very difficult to prosper without a good level of protection, 
protection either in terms of rising the level of the island (geographical)
and in terms of insurance is very important for protecting what you built. 

While research is a very important matter indeed, 
in some cases of natural disaster is not helping much to avoid catastrophe. 
The game also showed that chance matters a great deal, 
if you are hit badly by a natural disaster 
there's not much you can do but rebuild.
And insurance might not be enough to repay you, so other types of protection can 
make the difference,even thoug they can be expensive.

I like the idea of making connections to survive better in time of disasters.

I think too much importance is put on the research in this game.	

In any case it was good, because it makes you realise how important is to develop things in life and to pay attention at the "comets" coming towards you. Some of the times, even insurance is not enough !</div>
