    <div class="field-value">Thank you for a well written thought out reflection. It was a pleasure to peer review. You had carefully included the principles of risk management in your analysis of how well or, as you said not so well, played the game. I like how you related the volatility of the oil prices in your country to develop a trade-off model in your revision of the game. I think spreading the cost of the building the pods is a good idea practically, but I am not so sure about this in terms of wealth generation and community development, which the game was about. 


Good luck for the remainder of the course</div>
