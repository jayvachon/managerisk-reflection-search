    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong></strong>Hello Peer Reviewer,</p><p>Like most of us, I too attempted many a times at the game. I could pass three levels and failed at level-4. My unique code is : <strong><u>BaJA5Vr</u></strong></p><p><strong></strong>Please find below Game Reflection point wise. Thank you!</p><p><b>1.1 Role of Risk
Management In the game:</b><br /></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>The comets in the game posed as risk elements.
Each comet had a different probability of hitting the planet with a varied
amount of severity.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>By understanding this, one has to implement the
basic principles of risk management i.e. identifying the risk, preparing to
cope with its effects and finding avenues of development</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>The role of risk management was crucial as one
has to develop new pods, upgrade the existing pods in tandem with the comets
(risks) hitting the planet.</p>

<p><b>1.2 Choices and
trade-offs</b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>While playing the game, to cope up with the
damage done be the comets, I chose to take insurance after developing 1-2 pods.
I took the insurance cover for 50% in level-1 and level-2.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span> However,
in level-3 and level-4, I increased the insurance cover up to 75% as 5-6 pods
were developed and upgraded.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>As the number of upgraded pods increased, an
increased chance of damage was foreseen and hence I started investing cash on
research and kept the protection bars (on the right) as high as four. </p>

<p><b>1.3 Preparation for
risk affects development:</b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>While playing level-1, one has ample amount of cash
and initial cost of setting up pods in low. Hence development is not affected
drastically in level-1<b></b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>However as levels increase, the cost of
upgrading pods increase, the insurance costs increase and the number of comets
(risks) increase.<b></b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>There is a clear and direct correlation wherein
preparation for risk affects development drastically in subsequent levels. <b></b></p>

<p><b>2.1 Doing different
things after playing the game more than once:</b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I played the game several times. When I played
it for the first time, I was aggressively developing pods, invested low in
insurance as well as on researching about the risk of severity with which the
comets would hit the planet. <b></b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>After getting repetitive hands on the game, I
planned the cash flow in a balanced way. I focused on development, community
building as well as spending on research to lessen the damage from comets. I
also took high risk cover in higher levels to minimize the damage and get risk
cover. <b></b></p>

<p><b>2.2 Key things
learned from the game:</b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Allocation of resources (cash) while planning
risk protection.<b></b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Knowhow of upcoming risks should be practiced to
counter those risks in an efficient manner<b></b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Community building is a powerful tool to counter
risks <b></b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Diversification of resources (i.e. spending of
cash) among risk protection tools viz insurance and researching about risks in
a balanced manner. <b></b></p>

<p><b>3.1 Adding/Changing
one simple thing for newer version of game:</b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>The research button should have numeric levels
of protection and there should be avenues of points which boost development in
terms of cash or shooting comets.<b></b></p>

<p><b>3.2 Better represent
the risk management choices that matter in the place you live</b></p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I live in a place where the risk of famine is
very high. This year the rainfall has been scanty till date and there is a
clear risk of drought the nation is facing. <b></b></p>
