    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the student does not digress while answering the questions, and the answers written are relevant and sufficiently descriptive. The one thing that I think would make the reflection better is the last paragraph that could have been more clearly said in terms of adding one thing to make the risk management game relevant to the place the student lives. The student does not clearly tell us whether the addition is relevant for the place where this student lives.</div>
