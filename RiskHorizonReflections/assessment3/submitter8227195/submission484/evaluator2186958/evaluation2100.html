    <div class="field-value">What is the key strength of this reflection?
The live example of Pakistan and its war against terrorism is excellent although not included as the core of any of the questions. I don't know the origin of terrorism in Pakistan but your reccomendations are highly consuming in resources, it seems higher than a natural disasters as it never ends. I hope there is a way of making a peace conversations between goverment and terrorist leaders like in Colombia, our neighbor country (I live in Venezuela) with the help of friend countries and organizations to find a path to end the internal war. 
What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
Not all answers were given according to questions 1, 2 and 3. Answers were too general and coveres only one paragraph. </div>
