    <div class="field-value">The reflection does walk the reader through the concepts that the game is designed around, making it clear that he or she understood the purpose of the exercise. However, the reflection on the experience had some room for improvement. He or she writes that you should be given the choice to select another location because "there are always places available around us which are safer but costlier." I think this fails to consider the point of the game, which is to force the player to choose from resources and strategies that actually available to us.</div>
