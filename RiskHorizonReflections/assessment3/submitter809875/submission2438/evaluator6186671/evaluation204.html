    <div class="field-value">Fairly good attempt to relate risk as represented by meteors to real world risk assessment and mitigation. Generally too descriptive and there was an absence of "feelings" in the reflective piece. This student should have followed the instructions more clearly and give recommendations for developing a new version of the game along specific parameters. This was unfortunately ignored.</div>
