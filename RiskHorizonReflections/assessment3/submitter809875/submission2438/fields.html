    <h1>Submission 2438 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 809875, session_user_id: 2a1be0899c3af3e2b56fe27c0ca55c077680e0b2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">         The game tell us how to manage risk, and how to research, protect and insure for the risk. The steroids reflect the risks we face in everyday life and the severity of the steroids reflect the severity of our everyday risks. <br />         Pods represent our development that are affected by the risks we faced. Insurance could be taken to after develop the pods and the risks to be prevented by building the protective fence around the pods. <br />     I have played the game twice and once i could get how to check the adversity of risks i am facing. The nest time i attempted the game i have already prepared as insured for the risks i faced. I could have gone for cost benefit analysis and have allocated my money properly in an order to reduce the quantum of risks i face.<br />    I think the game will reflect my current situation if i alter the game by increasing the amount of steroids (amount of risks faced) and changing or increasing the severity of risks. <br /></div>
