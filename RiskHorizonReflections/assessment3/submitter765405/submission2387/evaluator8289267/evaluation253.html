    <div class="field-value">1. This reflection is good. It can show what happened in game and what will we learn from this game.

2. But, this reflection need to be adjusted as follow:

- In the first place, I sad that "The location of the pods also mattered". In fact, it is never a matter in this game, or to make it clearer, any locations are the same.

- Finally, you sad that "Doing more research and taking timely protection in terms of insurance as well as community connections would've definitely helped me in crossing level 3 as well". As a matter of fact, I already tried many combinations such as: a) (usual, sometimes, seldom) research, insurance (30%,50%,75%), protection (lv1, lv3, lv5); b) (usual, sometimes, seldom) research, insurance (30%,50%,75%); c) insurance (30%,50%,75%), protection (lv1, lv3, lv5); d)(usual, sometimes, seldom) research, protection (lv5, lv7, lv9). Finally, I give a conclusion that play as d choice (usual research and protection at least lv7), you will win this game at least lv5. </div>
