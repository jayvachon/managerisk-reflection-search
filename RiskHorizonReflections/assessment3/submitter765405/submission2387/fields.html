    <h1>Submission 2387 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 765405, session_user_id: f7e255cf0b4b955e29f1ed5fc70c55f48af0a671)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main focus of risk management in this game was to ensure that the impact of the comet attack was minimum. It also involved taking enough insurance and creating adequate protection in order to cope with the risks well. Risk management involved trade-offs in terms of cost and investment, but investing in insurance was important as it gave some relief when it came to the fear of loss due to the level of damage caused by the comets. But investing in insurance also hindered some of the development and repair activities as the wealth was limited. Building enough community connections would have helped achieve more protection and assurance in times of crisis. Gaining knowledge about the severity of attack and chances of hit of the comets resulted in better decision making, as the amount of insurance matched the level of severity of the comets. The location of the pods also mattered while taking insurance as well as repair decisions as both had to be managed according to the cost budget and available wealth.   </p><p>When I played the game for the second time, the only thing which I did differently was to take insurance more carefully, as in, by gaining more and timely knowledge about the severity of the comets. Building enough community connections would have helped achieve more protection and assurance in times of crisis. Doing more research and taking timely protection in terms of insurance as well as community connections would've definitely helped me in crossing level 3 as well.</p><p>When it comes to introducing a change in this game, all I can think of is that the earliest detection of the comets and their severity would be very helpful in taking timely decisions and ensuring maximum protection. In other words, better research and timings would make a lot of difference. </p></div>
