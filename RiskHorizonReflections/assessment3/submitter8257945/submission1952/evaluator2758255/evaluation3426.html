    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection was in relating the game to risk management in the real world. I especially liked the suggestion that the game should consider adding communication and dissemination challenges. The reflection could be improved with clearer writing and more direct answers to the questions asked in the prompt. Some of the questions were not fully answered and the essay seemed disjointed.</div>
