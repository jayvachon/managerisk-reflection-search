    <div class="field-value">The key strength of your reflection is that you clearly described the role and the cost of protection, knowledge and insurance.  I think you understand them pretty well that you did so good in the game.
One thing that I would like to mention is that you forgot to give your comments on question 3, "What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?". I think you sure have a nice idea on that!</div>
