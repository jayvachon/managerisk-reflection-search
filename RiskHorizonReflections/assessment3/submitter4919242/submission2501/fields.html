    <h1>Submission 2501 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4919242, session_user_id: 2ec3d0c61f076ef573a523f2d57f81131fbed6ea)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">It's very interesting and I really have fun with it. Risk management is the core of this game, it's about the balance between building and protection. Based on the design I deeply know the impact of knowledge, protection and insurance. Knowlege can decrease the severity but costs time while protection costs much money. Insurance is a kind of remedy. I should make a decision on whether to rebuild or buy the insurance. In the whole process of playing I didn't use the insurance because I make a high level of protection so I almost have no loss.Â <br /><br />I had played it twice, I only at level 1 at first time in lackness of actions for getting knowledge and protection. But in my second try, I reached level 4 when I learned how to make a trade-off. My conclusion is that we should focus both on building and risk management which includes knowledge, insurance and protection. But as a Swhole plan for developing, our major task is to bulid so as to get more money for protection. In addition, spare some time for getting knowledge is important too.<br /><br /></div>
