    <div class="field-value">In this reflection the author's thoughts are articulated in a clear way, so it is easy understand it. The description of knowledge, insurance, and protection in the game accurately conveys the meaning of these concepts as they have been presented in the course. The essay includes reflection of what the player learnt from the game, but it is too short and the author did not propose changes in the game.</div>
