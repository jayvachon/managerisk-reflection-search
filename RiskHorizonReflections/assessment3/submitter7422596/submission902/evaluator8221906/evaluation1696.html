    <div class="field-value">There is a clear focus on the game and what it involved instead of makeng an analysis of risk management ans Its implications considering the obstacles, resources and key components of risk management. 
Taking into account that there could be a natural desaster in the game, It must have been analyzed the implications of the risk as knowledge, operational obstacles, behavioral beases and investments up front in the community. 

What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?

It would have been a great reflection if you have made an analysis taking into account the tools given in lecture.
