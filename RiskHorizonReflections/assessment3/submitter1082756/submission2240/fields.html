    <h1>Submission 2240 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1082756, session_user_id: 3f477301549b35f1aa95d0b53e8a1f1bba286483)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
three components (research, insurance and protection) of risk management played
an important role as tools to assess the severity of the threat, to reduce the
level of damage and serve as a shield to protect against any loss caused by
flooding. In terms of trade-offs, depending on the severity of the hit, the research
component of risk management gives an edge over insurance since it provides a better
assessment of the risk and more financial resources to upgrade the pods in
contrast with the upgrading the level of protection which is very costly. In
regard to development, preparation for risk has a positive effect in the long
term as in the short term since it helps reduce the loss of lives and material resources
immediately and any perverse effect on economic growth in the long term.</p>

<p><span>Indeed,
I played the game many times to reach level 4 and after the first time I have focused
more on research or knowledge in order to have more resources to upgrade my
pods and therefore reduce the impact of the comets.  As I was progressing through higher levels,
the main things I have learnt from the game is that the better way to manage
risk is to: </span></p>

<p><span>(a)     </span>To do some research about
the threat in order to assess the severity of the risk;</p>

<p><span>(b)     </span>Raise the level of
protection either by buying insurance or most of all by upgrading the level of
community connection.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Finally,
if I had the opportunity to change or add a simple thing, I would propose that “Raising
the level of awareness about risks facing the most vulnerable” represent better
the risk management choice that matter in my country.</span></p></div>
