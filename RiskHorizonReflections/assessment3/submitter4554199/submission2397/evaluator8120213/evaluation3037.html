    <div class="field-value">when I read your essay, I can feel your reflection of this game is so wonderful, and let me know you did a deep thinking about this horizion game. About clarity grade, your essay has a logical chain, can understand easy. And through reading your essay, most of them express "efficient risk managment" theory. But I think you need to say about after occur risk, there has communities benefits (ex: the relationship of position plots) . Finally, your reflection about the risk horizon game, is really wonderful, about wiriting gradual risk. Keep going to fianl project , do your best!  I really want to you have a good grade at fianl project!</div>
