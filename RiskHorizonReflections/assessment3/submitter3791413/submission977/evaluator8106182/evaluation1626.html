    <div class="field-value">This is a well written text coming from somebody with first-hand experience, living in the Caribbean region. I was somewhat flippant of the risks because I come from a part of Europe where we do not have hurricanes, earthquakes, severe flooding or landslides.  As a result this reflection is one of the more informative pieces of text, with real gravitas, that I have read thus far in the course.
The proposals to improve the game are very pertinent and would make it even more difficult to succeed but probably much better as a result and a closer match to reality.
A very simple improvement to the reflection would be just write shorter sentences, since at times I, as a native speaker, had to re-read the sentence to refresh what was being said. Well done.
