    <h1>Submission 198 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8233285, session_user_id: 4910265b8136e119509f1d39e7644a8a74478f9d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game forced the player to make a variety of choices in how they approached rick management. It terms of confronting these choice, the player had to immediately prioritize. Was researching (knowledge) incoming comets the best way to protect the pods? Was purchasing insurance to more cheaply build repairs a priority of spending money, or was using the slider bar to build protection the best way to spend money? Making this initial choice immediately set the direction for how a player build pods. After initially trying to balance, I tried to rely on one path (research) which worked until a massive comet took me down in level 5. Had I spread out my risks, maybe I would have been better prepared for the large comet, but I am unsure about this. By not spending resources on as much protection, I was able to spend money on building pods and using connections as a means of prevention as well. <br /><br />If I were to play the game a second time, I think I would try to take on a completely different approach to building pods, by focusing on a couple of pods instead of trying to develop nine at once. As well, I might spend a little less on insurance as the game if I was going to focus on research - there would be less damage to repair. Preparing for the large comet in level five would still be very difficult. It came so late into the round, a lot of protection and resources would definitely be needed to survive this comet. <br /><br />If I could make one change in the game that would better represent the risk management choices for where I live, I would have a variable unknown. If the town I live in, we receive massive amounts of snow and as a result snow removal becomes a major priority for our town. Unfortunately, funding for snow removal changes from year to year depending on our state government budget, leaving us only a small amount of time to adequately prepare a snow removal budget. Adding a variable (unexpected) challenge would be very beneficial. Often times, when we execute risk management planning, unexpected and unpredictable challenges often arise, forcing us to change our initial plans and strategies. Items like a pod randomly collapsing or even upgrading would provide a more realistic touch. Overall, I found the game to have a lot of real-life applications; it was very enlightening and appreciated. </div>
