    <div class="field-value">The writer demonstrates very good knowledge of risk management principles. However, the writer focused specifically on describing potential and generic options a player could take, rather than demonstrate the lessons learned from the writer's game experience. I believe the essay would have been much stronger had the author focused more on strategy and analysis, and less on the descriptions provided during gameplay. Additionally, the final question was only partially answered, and was not clear (particularly since development in the game earns income -- perhaps the author means building industry to make more income on par with development? It's impossible to tell).</div>
