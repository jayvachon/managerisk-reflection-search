    <h1>Submission 1505 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8315849, session_user_id: 1d10a14b4cb7d3f102b53f2bbd7ecdbebdbf6949)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management plays a crucial role in this game. The game was very educative as it explains the significance to manage risks in the most efficient way. It was very interesting in all its aspects. The game covers the concept of risk management in all the levels, thereby giving me an ultimate experience of different stages of risks and their after-effects. A strategy game that instructs within itself the challenges that could be symbolically related to the instances in our daily life. 
Being the Luminator of Alora, the task given was to develop the community by predicting risks and to make sure that there is advancement in the society. It was a very challenging game as it enables us to take decisions and take the right amount of risks by researching on them. By building pods, the rate of development would increase and thereby making the environment much safer.
It was important to note that there should be a sense of balance throughout as we had to check for few constraints before we could develop and safeguard the land. This aspect taught me the significance of accountability that we possess in our lives to take care of the environment we live in and also to take considerable amount of risks on an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the community to bear the shocks but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It is indeed really important to research on the risks that come our way and eventually develop on a protection plan to minimize the damages from it. Insurance is also a key element in the game, as it ensures and safeguards the land from major damage. It will be cheaper and quicker to rebuild the pods after damage. Striking a balance between them all and performing each action with utmost care was indeed a very challenging task. 
While playing the game, it was also important to do proper time management as we had a time constraint in developing the land of Alora and also to protect them from the waves caused by the meteors. So within the specified time, good research, protection, development and insurance against the damages were to be done in the best possible way. Good research was mandatory as it educated us with the performance and the severity of the meteors and how it could affect the environment. Preparation of risks also helped in money management. Building the right number of pods with the given budget and also to insure them was a decision that we had to take after much reflection and thought.
 By undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to be put into best possible usage. 
If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would have made it comparatively more realistic by introducing real life situations of protecting a city or environment and have obstacles and risks in relation to the real-life scenarios. I would have also introduced few other concepts in which the players could make some money as they deal with damages.
