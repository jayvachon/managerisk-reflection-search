    <h1>Submission 1606 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4303625, session_user_id: 091248ad9ddf6c4a4c368f978cd6d415c9f3b624)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Although I greatly enjoyed playing, I found the risk management game much more difficult than I had originally anticipated. Previous to playing I thought I was able to make safe, rational decisions which would benefit in the long term. However, despite being a very cautious person and being fully informed on the future risks posed by the meteorites I still failed to adequately protect my city from and prepare them for risks.<br /><br />My first few games ended quickly with my buildings being destroyed through a lack planning and running out of funds because I had not insured them against these risks. Nevertheless on my third attempt I provided my buildings with greater levels of insurance which both reduced the levels of damage and lowered the costs of recovery. I also started to better appreciate how researching and being informed on the risks- meteorites- allowed me the benefit of 'lifting' the ground when necessary thus further reducing damage.<br /><br />The main challenges I faced when trying to apply successful risk management were budgeting and multi-tasking. Firstly, when taking into consideration the limited funds it was difficult to strike the right balance between building structures and preparing them for and from future shocks. The difficult decisions and forced compromises provided really strong examples of the issues faced by governments, communities and individuals when considering risk management. Secondly, the game also successfully illustrated the difficult balance of considering conflicting priorities. For example the development of the buildings and community whilst also ensuring it was adequately protected against and prepared for risks. <br /><br />If I were to play the game again I would firstly plan ahead before starting, take out at least a mid-level insurance and gradually build my community. Given my previous experiences I now appreciate the importance of research and therefore would assess each meteorite, establishing when one poses a risk and consequently 'lifting' the community when necessary to minimise damage thus reducing the cost of recovery. This reflects the importance of communities or governments both being aware of potential risks but also acting accordingly and taking on required protective actions and insurance. Through these precautions one can achieve long term security against risks.<br /><br />In conclusion, I felt the game highlighted the issues associated with risk management, most notably remembering the long term whilst seeing the immediate growth. Also I gained a greater appreciation of the benefits of preparing through risk management became really apparent, understanding and recognising risks and the benefit of insurance. <br /></div>
