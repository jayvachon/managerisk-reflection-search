    <div class="field-value">The reflection demonstrates that the games was played more than once and that, during the process of replaying, the student came to grips with the risk management tools represented. Relating the reflection to a real life situation would have made it better, however, I appreciate that the word limit was a major constraint. Well done.</div>
