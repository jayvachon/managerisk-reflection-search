    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is very educational to show the great importance of having a safe, this is a great method to take a good time resources and move them to a moment of crisis. The insurance has a huge impact on the repercussions of a crisis, greatly facilitating the recovery of the consequences of a catastrophe, even these "extra" resources are less time to overcome and return to normal in which we produce resources.On the other hand it is important to note that although it is always better to have insurance of better coverage, cost, and need be analyzed, taking care not to fall into cognitive biases, such as positive thinking bad things we should not happen to us or not something that affects our community not affect our family. This leads to the next point.<br /><br />Inform us, is of vital importance to have as much information as we can about the risks to which we are exposed, also the quality of this information is something that you should invest resources. It will help you choose the insurance with the best ratio cost - benefit. The information is also useful to know what precautions to be taken for the specific class of risk, thus no resources with unnecessary or exaggerated preparations are wasted. This brings us to the third point that the game teaches.<br /><br />Preparation is essential to address the risks, to be better prepared to face a specific risk, the negative impact that this entails are lessened greatly. Always be possible to negative results but be prepared for this and have protections designed specifically to confront puts the odds on our side.<br /><br />Finally in the game a great lesson about how to manage our resources, helped me understand that growth should not be uncontrolled, do not try to have as many resources as possible, but the optimal amount to which we can look and manage efficiently. Seek resources become strong themselves to withstand the crisis.<br /></div>
