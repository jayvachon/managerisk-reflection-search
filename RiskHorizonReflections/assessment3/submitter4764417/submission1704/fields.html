    <h1>Submission 1704 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4764417, session_user_id: 6bb1e20f653135815c51213df36b047fe1e38b76)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management played an important role in the game and was the crux of the entire game. The choices were to balance the trade-offs between developement and risk taken to achieve this. I choose to increase the developement activity along with getting an adequate level of insurance incase of a disaster (comet striking). Also connecting the pods and thereby connecting the community also played a huge part in sharing re-sources when the community was damaged. As resources will be shared and thus this helps the community to re-develop faster incase of any calamity. It is very necessary to prepare for risks as illustrated by the game. By purchasing adequate insurance and protection I was in a better position to counter the damage caused by the comets. Also by getting adequate knowledge of the severity of the comet I could divert the resources towards further development, accordingly if there was an indication that there isn't going to be much damage or the chance of the comet causing harm on Alora was negligble. <br />Since I played the game more than once, I tried getting a right balance between building the correct number of pods and purchasing the insurance and protection along with each level. Further, in my consequent attempts I also tried getting more knowledge about the comets and then spend resources in the right manner. Some of the key learnings from the game are (a) How to manage risk effectively. (b) Trade-off between Risk Management and Developement (c) The importance of connected communities during key events be it natural disasters or everyday concerns. (d) Developement and community awareness go hand in hand. <br />The game is truly a good and fun way to learn about risk managment and developement of a whole community. If given a chance I would definitly like to add some more risks along with the damage caused by comets to this game. This would give the game more flavour and would help people understand and cope with the fact that not all risks are known there could be some risks which turn up and for which we may have to plan in a better way or allocate some reources so that they are taken care of. Like the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 was not at all a known risk , however it took the whole world by storm, forcing many MNC's and even soveriegn's to go bankrupt. So we should always be prepared to counter known as well as unkown risks.<br /><br /></div>
