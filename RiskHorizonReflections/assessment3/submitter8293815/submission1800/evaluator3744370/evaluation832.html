    <div class="field-value">the key strength of this reflection is that the student has very clearly articulated his/her learning experience from the game. he/she has very clearly described the three key components of risk management, substantiating it by giving reference to the game and has very neatly put forward how he/she used these components to reach level five in the game.
this reflection is very fulfilling and covers every aspect of the game. i cannot point out a flaw in it or something the student missed, which would make the reflection better.</div>
