    <h1>Submission 1421 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2728765, session_user_id: cc2cfba6ca3d112246d55714683bbf01583162c7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1- Well, the roll of risk management is build a community and keep them safe for the unwanted events such as flood, earthquake etc. First, check the place the location in order to see if there is any risks we should protect ourselves. After checking the location we have noticed that the pod where we are going to build is under high risk of flooding and earthquake which comets cause. So we get the insurance prior to start construction immediately. Then we build our pods higher on the ground to prevent possible flood. <br /><br />2- When I played the game for the first time I realized that purchasing insurance for 75% coverage is not necessary but after I got hit by the comet the price I paid was way more than the insurance policy fee. Main things I learnt from the game is we should prioritize the things before we start construction. And we should do it in order. <br /><br />3- What I would change? I would change the scenery of the game for sure. For example, make it much more realistic like it is gonna happen on the earth planet with human and animal figures. I think that would be much more effective. Well, where I live is agriculture is done conventionally. This year we had heavy storms and then our fields hit by the huge rain storm. We have nearly 80% product loss. If you are going to ask if we had an insurance for the each piece of land in different locations I am afraid I am gonna say "NO." Unfortunately. But everybody had a lesson I guess. Next year insurance companies are going to make quite good money. <br /><br />Thanks for reading my assignment. I hope you are having great time with bunch of people attending this course. Cheers.</div>
