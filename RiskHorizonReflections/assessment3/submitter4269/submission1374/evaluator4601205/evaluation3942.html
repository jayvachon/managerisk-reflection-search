    <div class="field-value">Obviously, the student 2 did not made any reflection. Maybe there is a mistake, but I only get 3 lines (less than 60 ) instead of 600 words. 

It is a pity, I cannot judge this work and can't tell more about this short reflection. I decided to note the overall evaluation 0 as the student did not fulfilled the instructions. </div>
