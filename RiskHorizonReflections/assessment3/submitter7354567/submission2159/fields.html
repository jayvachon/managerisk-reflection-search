    <h1>Submission 2159 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7354567, session_user_id: bfd077416177ed9c1eb0acabedd5943cde7dc7f6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.  The role of RM is to identify the possible damage the comet can inflict and how best one can mitigate those risk through research, and insurance. Initially I made choices with insurance, which I was able to benefit from due to the amount I took and the severity of the damage when the comet hit.  At times due the measures which I implemented within the community I suffered very little loss or no loss at all when the comet hit.  I was able to achieve this only after a few attempts at the game. <br /><br />2.  I played the game a few times, by then I was better able to predict the hit I was about to experience but not the severity of the damage. Lack of research caused some drawback to my success. Later I did engage in research and was able to withstand the impact of the comet with minimum damage or note at all.   I was also able to mitigate some risk due to research and losses which I encountered in previous games. At times I purchase to little insurance and was unable to repair  some of my communities. The lesson learnt is research, research, research, and always have insurance to aid in renewing your community. I realized that I had to get my community high off the ground to reduce the level of the comet impact, and I tried not the build communities to close to the edge of the land space. Most of my destruction occurred close to the boarder of my communities.<br /><br />3.  For me I would introduce a secondary risk. I say this due to the fact that being from the Caribbean we are presently dealing with ChicV and since we are in the rainy season, it is only a matter of time Dengue presents itself.  However, the challenge we will have is how do we manage a Dengue outbreak along with Chic V.  Although the both originate from the same vector, the resources are limited, and as a Public Health Agency we are expected to support Caribbean Member countries to survive and cope with these diseases.  Human Resource is limited, funding is limited,.  The only way to mitigate the impact, is through transfer of knowledge to the countries.<br /><br /></div>
