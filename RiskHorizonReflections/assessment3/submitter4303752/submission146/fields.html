    <h1>Submission 146 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4303752, session_user_id: 84d7e047811b51a7e768172a9f95ec5ad092e565)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game is that: Alora falls victim to falling comets, shocks as we call them. These comets careen into the water and cause waves that hinder development, and we must balance between growing our community and preparing for these potential shocks. I bought insurance, raised my land and did researches. Those trade-offs were the more I lifted, the more it cost. I played the game many times and tried in different ways, like bought insurance earlier or lifted the land higher... The main things I learned from it is that to succeed is that the only way to succeed is to find the perfect balance and by using these three powers in concert with development, we will create a healthy community.  If  I am tasked with developing a new version of the game,one simple thing I would <span>propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live is the risk of the over-amount of flood inside the land.</span></div>
