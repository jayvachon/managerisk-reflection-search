    <h1>Submission 2458 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8320761, session_user_id: e93bb64729ed54256de2216cae2e52beba8c5acd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><strong>1.  </strong></p><p>The
role of risk management in Risk Horizon was to allow development to
continually progress in the face of shocks through the adoption of risk management tools
(“powers”):  knowledge (“research”), protection and
insurance.  Knowledge and protection mitigated and in some cases
prevented shocks, while insurance assisted in coping after a shock
occurred.  However these tools were required to be adopted
strategically.<br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p>Choices
were required to decide whether and to what extent risk could be
managed and prepared for versus taking action after the occurrence of
a shock.  Further, a continual cost-benefit analysis was necessary to
balance: the costs of developing the Alora community; the costs – whether financial or to the development bar – of
preparation and prevention measures; and having funds available for post-shock repairs.  Lastly, time management was
also an integral factor to consider.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Each
risk management tool had a financial cost that lessened the amount
that could be spent on building or upgrading pods to grow the
community.  The growth of the community itself was something that
required time in order to achieve.  Protection had the capacity to
reduce the long-term effects of a shock but not without a financial
cost, a reduction in the rate of development and time constraints. 
The accumulation of research, with the right time and cost
management, was a powerful and cheap option to plan for, mitigate and
in some instances protect from shocks.  Finally, the benefit of
insurance – despite the outlay having no immediate benefits, high
initial costs, and no assured return on investment – by and large
reduced the overall expenditure and timeframes of coping with damages
after a shock.

<p><br /></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><strong>2.  </strong></p><p>I
played Risk Horizon multiple times and the main lesson I learned from
the game was the importance of understanding the nature of the
situation (ie. the game and it's rules) in a timely manner.  Without
having read “How to Play” first and launching straight into
“Play” I made no effort to prepare myself for what I was about to
experience.  My first attempts resulted in a fair amount of trial and
error, taking many uneducated and unnecessary risks and not
recognising and taking advantage of opportunities when they
presented.  In general I improved with each subsequent game.  I say
“in general” as I also learned that regardless of how well
prepared I was, some shocks were unexpectedly large and devastating
even with risk management tools in place.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>On
reflection, this likely reflects some real world scenarios where
failure to prepare for a shock is caused by lack of background
understanding coupled with the inability to recognise both risks and
opportunities; as well as the reality that shocks can be costly and cannot always be wholly prevented.  This game has afforded me a better understanding of
this fact.  I have also come to better appreciate the complexity of
risk management.</p>
<p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong></p>
<p>Keeping in mind I only made it to level three I have submitted two ideas in the instance that one of them features at higher levels.  First I thought some form of cultural norm could
be introduced to the game.  Being that the game lacked a human
element I thought the introduction of a human consideration such as a
cultural norm might assist in encouraging empathy in the player.  My
other idea was to include a form of positive shock that the player
could benefit from.  For example a comet may hit but it has a
resource that can be utilised to increase the rate of development,
giving the player another component to manage in the game.</p>
