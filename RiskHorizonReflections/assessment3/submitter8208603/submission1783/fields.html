    <h1>Submission 1783 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8208603, session_user_id: c7ced68c2cc3b79108addfde37a25f869ab15271)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.Risk management is the study which identifies the process of risk involved in it. the role of risk management in the game was to ensure that without any kind of risk we were asked to build the alora community using the milestones, which in order lead to the balancing of risk and also ideology for building the healthy development of the community.There were 
						comets which are falling into the water and cause waves that hinder 
development. and we must balance between growing community of alora and 
preparing for potential shocks.luckily, we have abilities which  can help us to access the three powers- they are:  Research, 
Protection, and Insurance. i personally felt that the power to look out into space and learn the chance of the comet 
hitting,impact of time, and the severity of the comet. the long term protection against the waves could be prevented by clicking the slider, located on the screen, into the upright position to raise the island. the level of protection, indicated the severity of the comet, it was our job to prevent pods from being damaged. But the more we click the slider button the screen 
the more power costs reduced. 
				and finally to use insurance as the easiest way or method to protect the alora community and built it as a wide community. it was the easiest way to protect pods damaged from floods will be quicker and cheaper to rebuild. 
					Insurance recovers the lost development time after the  pods are done.Click the insurance button to open the insurance plan and purchase and select a plan. <br />2. After playing the game once i would prefer to use the ideas, or the experiences which i had got while playing the risk management game.the entire concept of the game what i tried for the first time i would have modified as per the difficulties that i faced at each level of alora community construction. when i kept trying for the game repeatedly i would have preferred to change the method of thinking because, once when i could not reach the destination of building the alora community it clearly defines that the strategy used were not upto the mark and it requires some modifications. the main things which i learnt were before i could decide let me think what happens if i plan to do so.therefore prior planning is necessary. we should try to understand the situation better and only then we should apply it in real sense.<br />3.Though the game was simple it requires lot of patience and also the ability to think and we must be a good observer-er in order to ensure that were the comets, come and fall on to the river. if i have given an opportunity to come up with new version of game, then the factors which makes me alter could be time limit, irrespective of the attempts which ever level has scored the highest score will be accounted for the game. the easy access to the people could be by sharing the game on all the smartphones, by giving the task on the page itself instead of providing only the link. the sample game should be with the instructions mentioned at each level of the game. and finally to say that the only way for success is to find the perfect balance, which is established by keeping our eyes on the screen and just waiting for the events to happen simultaneously. therefore its very important to ensure that risk management will be handled properly only when the risk is very much familiar or only when we come across risk.<br /></div>
