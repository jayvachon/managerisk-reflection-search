    <h1>Submission 1307 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8294094, session_user_id: d57b882dc9c15651f44029c7fe17cab5f47deb7f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is to reduce the time and the cost to rebuild the colony in case the colony is hit by comets.  Obviously the trade off is the resource required to build and to upgrade the colony to next level.  In this game, I had to learn to use insurance and protection to reduce the damage which might affect the colony and the cost of repair the colony.  It wasn't clear immediately on how insurance was able to reduce the cost until comets hit the colony and affected the development of the colony.  I quickly learned that it would be best to max out my insurance coverage otherwise I would finish up my resources very quickly if more than one comet hit my colony and I won't be able to keep up my development in the given time.  Also, with protection, I can elevate the colony to minimize the damage cause by the flood.<br /><br />If I play the game one more time, I would purchase the maximum insurance coverage and protection to create a safe location for setting up the colony.  Otherwise I will not have enough time and resources for repairing the colony.<br /><br />The thing which was missing was newer tool to mitigate the risk.  As colony becomes more developed, I would assume the tool to reduce the risk will also evolve with the colony.  In this case, the tools such insurance and protection remain the same.  Perhaps, the game developer should consider more sophisticated tools as the colony is being developed to higher level.</div>
