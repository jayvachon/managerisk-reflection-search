    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this submission was the student's ability to keep on trying different strategies to the point of reaching level 3. Another strength was the ability to find a balance between  buying insurance, some protection, and building the community. The observations made would be able to be passed on to other users as studies. 

This reflection was good and covered all areas as indicated in the brief. I would think a bit more time should have been spent on the role of risk management to make it better.
