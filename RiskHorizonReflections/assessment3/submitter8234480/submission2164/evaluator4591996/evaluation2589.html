    <div class="field-value">The game reflection was written very well and the student demonstrated good understanding of the main components of risk management (knowledge, protection and insurance). The only small minus is that the student didn't notice that some elements of the game were related to the coping element of risk management, such as community interconnections as well as insurance as they both are used after the shock has happened. However this is just minor observation and the overall rating of the reflection is the highest one.</div>
