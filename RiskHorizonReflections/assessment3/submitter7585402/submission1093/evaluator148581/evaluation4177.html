    <div class="field-value">This essay was somewhat difficult to grade. It is well written and  it shows good understanding of the principles involved in the game, but it does not give any sense of how the "dynamic" of the game helped to deepen the understanding of these principles and their interaction. No suggestions were made on possible improvements on the game. </div>
