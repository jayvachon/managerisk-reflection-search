    <h1>Submission 2469 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3309786, session_user_id: 3f02afe1962c61496637aff64e896fbd16b0a871)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management is an essential tool for healthy development of Alora community in the game. On the one hand it costs most of the development resources. On the other hand, risk management is inevitable for further development and higher development rates to be tangible in the following development levels.<br />With limited resources, money and time, I had to work out priorities from time to time based on the current cost-benefit analysis. Thus, some preferred options and trade-offs incurred: 1) I chose to spend time to accumulate as most research <strong>knowledge</strong> as possible when the severity and especially the chance of a comet hitting is higher than average level; 2) when there was not a immediately coming comet hitting, and the building and upgrading of pods was well in place according to the financial status, I chose to raise the island for long-term <strong>protection</strong>; 3) As in practice, I was short of financial resource and invest most resources on pod development and protections in the beginning strategy, I actually chose no or the basic <strong>insurance</strong> plan to cope with the after-damage lost.<br />Knowledge of comet research helped boost my protection capability almost immediately to avoid severe damages, by allowing more time to create community connections right before the commit hits. Raising the island affected development after some time when the effort took some considerable time to become effective enough. And the insurance, as in my strategy, affect just a little and often after some time when some damages occurred in the final stages.<br />I played the game only once. If I were to play it again, I would proportion the limited amount of financial resources and time in a smarter way, based on my cost-benefit findings in the first round. Sometimes, I was too focused on protection based on a defensive mind, and ignoring the immediately effective knowledge which helped community connection. I learned some impressive things from the game: 1) Resources and time constraints play a basic role in responsible and effective risk management; 2) Given the limited resources, reasonable priorities and trade-offs have to be made from time to time to achieve the best balance between knowledge, protection and insurance.<br />By developing a new version of the game, I would propose to include some external actors around my own community/island, to present the risk management choices that matter in the place I live. In such scenario, external actors and my community share the risks of comet hitting, whereas we are at different development stages with a investment resource gap between us. So in the common effort of risk management of the region, we need also to bound together to work out a larger plan for the long-term benefit, overcoming the incentive issue of all parties involved.</div>
