    <div class="field-value">This essay is well written and easy to read and to understand. All tue questions of the task are answered. The essay is well structured. However, all the three points have a different length, so the first paragraph is extrememly long in comparisson to two others. It would be better to equalize the length of all the paragraphs for a better perception. It is good that the numbers are used to  signal the different paragraphs. However, different linking words could be used for this aim, too. In general, it is a very nice essay, but the structure could be improved just a little bit.  </div>
