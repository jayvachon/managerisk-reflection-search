    <h1>Submission 1662 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2788257, session_user_id: c85d211240f8c0169968b1b239fbcd1f252f3c89)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">[Ques 1]<br />The game intended to strike a balance between community development, resources optimization, risk mitigation, research and sustainability. My own choices were a prudent mix of all of these factors, and I believe that knowledge enhancement through research on the comets proved to be extremely beneficial in minimizing damage to the pods and enhancing sustainability in the process. Revenue generation was highly sustainable by itself and went a long way in repairing damaged pods and paying for insurance. I also found that several times, when research levels were low, then buying higher insurance proved quite beneficial in paying significantly less amounts for repairs and helped in bouncing back quickly.<br /><br />[Ques 2]<br />I played the game several times, attempting to match and mix between various different parameters. As mentioned above, I found the time investment in comet research to be very useful. My primary takeaways from the game were :<br />(1) Invest in good insurance if you do not conduct sufficient comet research<br />(2) Try to do research since it will save your resources while minimizing damage<br />(3) Research is not a waste of time since community development takes place simultaneously<br />(4) Try earning good amounts of revenue since it pays for community development as well as pod damage<br /><br />[Ques 3]<br />I would propose to add the ability to conduct better research on unforeseen disasters. A community thrives as well as sustains, only by investing suitable resources into high-quality research. Every community needs to invest in good Disaster Management Plans (DMPs) if it wishes to grow and sustain itself in the long term. Revenue earning, collaboration etc. would develop automatically once a community decides to invest in good research and gather quality data. It is only through high-quality data that any society or business gains the ability to manage risk.</div>
