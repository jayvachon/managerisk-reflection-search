    <h1>Submission 2099 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 164124, session_user_id: 8c3e7ec9da458f4834841a4331304e3e42d5541b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The Risk Horizon game's ultimate objective is economical growth; however, the road to prosperity can be rattled with incidence shock via some pesky comets that continuously fall into the waters and cause waves that hinder development.  As a user, we must balance between economic growth and preparing for these potential shocks by utilizing three different risk mitigators: research, protection and insurance.</div><div><br /></div><div>For my personal game, I found that protection was a relatively inexpensive risk mitigator.  I immediately piled on the protection and maintain a very high level of protection throughout the game.  The end result was that I never incurred any damage regardless of the number of comet impacts.  My economic growth was never hindered and I was always able to maintain all my resources for growth and protection.  This was my determination after two separate games where in the first game I tried to spread the mitigation between all three and did not receive as favorable a result as simply maintaining the highest level of protection.</div><div><br /></div><div> The game seems to have simple tradeoffs between research, protection and insurance; however, in real world application these tradeoff are not always very clear.  In addition, sometime these tradeoff can work together, i.e. using protection can lower insurance premiums.  I believe that this addition would make the game vastly more realistic and interesting albeit increasing the complexity significantly.</div></div>
