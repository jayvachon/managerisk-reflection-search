    <h1>Submission 1517 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307865, session_user_id: 960087116aab6b742811f6397f499d9fa113cf61)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Risk management played an important role in the game, as the goal  was to make
the community a stable, strong and prospering community. In order to reduce the
risk, I had develop the community and simultaneously have knowledge of the disasters,
and use insurance for the benefit of damages. Managing the uncertain events
needed a mix of knowledge about the occurrence, stability of the economy and also
securing the assets such as land and building which aided development.There were times I felt that protection was not very important when the chances of occurring of a meteor was low however later I understood the importance of staying protected at all times.</p>

<p>I made choices of building the community at level one
and protecting it through rigorous  research. This made the community stable and created
awareness about the coming disaster. The community was saved several times due
to this method. Insurance was not a useful tool at all times  but development had to be insured  and
hence was necessary. The protection handle was not used in the first level but
later on the need for it arose. Preparation of risk required additional costs
that needed to be removed from the development funds. Hence there was a
slowdown in the development of the community and the growth was slow. I  needed
to balance both growth and risk. </p>

<p>I played the game twice. I increased the research of
the new risks that were entering. The community was getting developed at a
comparatively slower pace and hence the additional cost was spent on covering
the risk through insurance and protection from the disaster. In addition to
this, when the disaster approached, the community could help one another and
divide the risk among them and the damage level was comparatively lower. Hence
the balance between development and risk cost was very essential. </p>

<p>The key learnings from this game were the existence of
insurance to cover up the damages, due to which the costs of repairing the
community was lower than before. Insurance, knowledge and protection help in
coping with the risks that are uncertain as always. These 3 tools can help a
community, nation and the world to sustain for a longer period of time.Also sometimes it was worth paying a insurance cover for up to 50% 0r 75% when the severity of ac meteor seemed high as the damages if at all they occurred could be easily recovered.</p>

<p><span>The newer version of the game should include a feature of having more complex damages when the meteor strikes such as having human capital in the economy.This might further make the learning more realistic as the decisions will vary when humans and emotions come into play and thus have an impact on the decisions we take about risk management.This would also add more zeal to the game as now the revenue needs to be split porpotionately for human capital and public expernditure apart from developing teh mere physical assets of development.</span></p></div>
