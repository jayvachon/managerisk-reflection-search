    <h1>Submission 823 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7459438, session_user_id: fa75c1a0a0ef3224dcd942ccf13d8db2f371d06c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk Horizon is a very well designed strategy game that
explains the importance of risk management for the healthy development in a
very simple way. I played the game two times. In the first run, I chose to
build all the Pods first and then upgrade them. Simultaneously, I attuned my
Protection level in-line with the maximum Severity of the meteor for the
respective levels. The chances of hit or probability of meteor causing damage,
also played a very crucial role. In round three, I faced one meteor with a very
high severity and chances of hit. Consequently I undertook an Insurance with
50% coverage which helped me a great deal in mitigating the damage. But I
lagged behind in researching and Knowledge front and hence reached only  till Level 3.</p>

<p>In the next run, I built 3-4 Pods and then upgraded them.
Connected community helped immensely resulting in minimal or no damage. I
observed  that when I was increasing my
protection level, my growth/game's progress came to a halt. Nevertheless, I
kept a very high level of protection which reduced the damages caused by highly
severe meteors with high chances of hit also to a very minimal level. Also I
noticed that once we incur damage, the progress bar also goes down, thus
mimicking the real life condition where our development is hampered
considerably by the risks. </p>

<p>The major learning from the game are that if we stay united
and face the problem as a connected community, then the risk reduces considerably.
Insurance is also very crucial in coping with the risk by mitigating our
losses. I learnt that preparing for the risk by researching , thus increasing
our knowledge and protection level, might seem very costly before the risk. But
the benefits of Protection heavily outweighs the Cost of risk preparation.</p><p>If I were to develop a newer version of the game, I would focus more on increasing the vitality of Knowledge and research in Risk Management in terms of effective preparation and coping mechanism for the risk.<br /></p></div>
