    <h1>Submission 1755 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2241200, session_user_id: 82bc8313a994e2362cc619d386445937b25ae8dd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game is<span> to identify and analyze the financial impact of loss to the community through</span> creating pods with making crucial decisions of purchasing insurance protection against natural disasters like comets' invasions.  This allows me to examine the use of realistic and cost-effective opportunities to balance retention programs like building and repairing pods in the community with 3 different types of commercial insurance against comet attacks.  In the game, I tend to rebuild as many pods as I can to rebuild the community.  As the game prolongs, I tend to buy higher insurance to protect against the potential loss of pods in the community.  The success of the community is based upon the numbers and the health of the pods.  So, my trade-offs were to repair less pods but buy higher insurances to protect existing pods as I play to get to level 2.   Although I made more progress each time, I could not get advanced to pass level 2.  But, I made better choices as I understand the games better.   I think I was not able to advance to level 3 because I was lacking patience to examine all the angles of the game.  However, I felt that I was making better choices each time as I understood the purpose of the game. I felt that preparation for risk with higher insurance allows me to make choices to either repair existing pods or make new pods.   It was difficult to do both at the same time as the resources are depleting rapidly as the comet attacks became more frequent.  <br /><br />I played the games a few times, as I felt that I did not understand the game well.  After the first time I played the game, I went back to the tutorial to better understand the game.  I have learned that going back to the beginning allowed me to make better game plans between repairing pods and building more pods with higher insurance.  As each time I played, I felt that I progressed more and more and made better choices probably because I understood the situation better and thus I was able to understand the decision of making trade-offs.  If I played again, I certainly would go back to the beginning of the game and re-evaluated my game plan with executing different insurance plans at different times,  I have learned that strategic decision making is important when the unknown is present.  The more severe the comets' attacks, the more and better choices I would have to make to sustain a community.   The game pushes me to examine what is the best action to serve the community with common goals.  Of course, this game is designed to test risk managerial skills of one person.  In reality, we have to work with others to make common strategic decisions.  I feel that this was not present in the game.   So, this game may indicate that I may be able to make good risk managerial decisions and not necessary tell me that I would be a good risk manager in reality because of lacking of cooperation with others to make sounded strategic decisions.  <br /><br />If I have to change the game, I propose to add one or more players in each game because choices are made through cooperation with different advisers in real life.  Although it is important to have a leader to make difficult choices, it is wise to get as many advises from colleagues and experts to evaluate all the options.  In the game different insurance plans were presented, but we did not know anything about the plans and the pay-offs of them.   It is difficult to make good choices when we face many uncertainties.   </div>
