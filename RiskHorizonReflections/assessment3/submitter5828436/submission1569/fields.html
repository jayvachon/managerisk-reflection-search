    <h1>Submission 1569 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5828436, session_user_id: 299db754a57fc3635ab9ae4ba557a887a70ec246)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of Risk Management
looked at the cost of taking action in the light of disasters in particular and
the cost to protect and insure against the disasters and then to recover. It
also looked at upgrading facilities to earn more resources so that due to
increase resilience. Researching the particular disaster (comets being simulated
as such) provided knowledge on the likelihood the disaster striking (severity) and
the chance of it impacting on the location (Chance of hitting). Shocks sometimes occur frequently one behind the other in quick succession and this in sometimes envitable and no matter how you prepare for it; there is nothing than can be done apart from adapting and changing. Also certain risk come very infrequently but when they do come its at that critical moment that can either make or break your coping strategies that you have put in place. It also showed
that there is not any allowance for insuring and protecting against disaster when
its coming is certain. With all these measures to take into consideration and having
very little resources in terms of time and money it was very hard to progress
through the levels of the game. However long term measures were effective to
allow for the progression from level 1 to level 2. I played a few times.
I would have placed a few building down and upgraded them whilst insuring, and building
the protection simultaneously.  I learnt that appropriate development takes
time and so does recovery which improves readiness and capacity to protect
against shocks. I would have added some kind of resource
collecting activity like mining or farming to physically show that resources
play a apart. I would have also added and changed the type of disasters so that it is easier to relate to.</p>
