    <h1>Submission 1328 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4938908, session_user_id: e5de57d9afbbe0a4947385a538330d8d7dcfd3f8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>This game enabled me to fully
understand the implications of the trade-offs between knowledge, protection and
insurance when it came to guarding against the meteoroids. Because of the
limitations which I had on firstly, time, and secondly, money, I had to think
quickly and make decisions promptly when the meteoroids were coming to my
planet. I would have liked to spend more time than I did on researching the
meteoroids but then I would have to compromise on insurance and protection (and
development of my planet). </span></p><p><span>I found that if I kept an adequate level of
protection (approximately the same number of bars that was the intensity of the
meteoroid) then most of the time there were no damages. Thus I found protection
especially important. Since I was always well protected I usually only bought
33% insurance and not more than that. I felt that this strategy was effective.
I learnt this by playing the game twice and I also learnt as I progressed from level to level. </span></p><p>I wanted to be ambitious and keep upgrading and building up the pods but the
main constraint was money. I had to wait for the money to replenish, but often
by the time it did I had to spend on protection or insurance and had to
compromise on development. I learnt to manage time and money more efficiently
as I kept playing the game. </p><p>Even though there were constraints however, I felt that
the money was being replenished quite fast and after playing the game once or
twice it became easy and I didn’t have to be as stressed out as before and did
not have to always be on edge. I think the game can be made more realistic by
adding more constraints on money. Living in a developing country (India), one of the
main constraints, which prevents the individuals, the community and the
government in this country from investing more in knowledge, protection, and
insurance is the resource constraint. </p><p>I would suggest that the monetary
endowment in this game be replenished at a slower rate or maybe the player
would have to take part in some economic activity to generate this money. This
could be added to make the game more challenging and realistic. Adding to this
resource constraint another thought I had was if another planet (or planets)
were introduced and possibly lend or borrow money from each other. This would
just be to add another dimension to the game even though it is currently already
quite dynamic. <br /></p></div>
