    <div class="field-value">The concepts have not been explained clearly. It appears a touch ambiguous at times. A good amount of introspection has gone into writing this piece and a very good degree of comprehension is evident from the description. A little more elaboration would have made this reflection better. For example, the Writer could have explained "hart shakes" a bit more.</div>
