    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br />The risk management part of this game is very important. I actually lost to reach the THIRD level in this game and tried to comprehend the risk and tried my best to save the chances to survive and make the safety bond for the spaces.Through this process or through my failure to reach the target I could assume that allocating resources for the right places and the right time is more important.Thus the management part comes. I had to think how I can save my Alora from the comets. At the same time, I had to consider the risk chances, the insurance part and the protection part. The risk management , thus, should consider all these points as well as the perfect plan to be taken in the right time and in the right places.Thus, the risk manager has to have the eyes open always because the challenge goes with keeping up the standard of the community. Then the knowing the risk factors along with the possible damage that might come.<br /><br />I played this game several time and I had to locate the Alora at different places. And I did it. In terms of my attempts I chose the insurance plan for rebuilding the damaged assets that the comets caused.From my experiences I couldn't make a good trade off knowledge protection and insurance and may be for that reason I couldn't reach to the target. But as time goes I learned from my different move.My realization is for the illuminator, the risk must be calculated and the decision must be taken aptly to avoid the adverse situation.<br /><br />Preparation for the risk should be taken earlier. The ways how we can mitigate the loss or how we can save our resources should be found out prior to the risks.The post disaster period is also important for us from which we may learn what went wrong and how the loss could be avoided.The other important factor is the aftershock impact.It means some factors may cause damage after the disaster. The lesson that we learned the games; like the tidal wave.Additionally, in my later attempt of this game I started to invest more in the research and gain knowledge that actually has helped me to minimize the costs for the development.Apparently, the investment for avoiding the risk might be high but the benefit that could be gained is really important.<br /><br />If I were asked to change the game I would add some signal before the disaster for the disaster preparedness.I would even add another strategies to make plan how the gamer can plan for the resettlement in an easy way. For me the technological barrier with the abstract pictures hinders for the easy comprehension of the game.<br /><br />Personally, this game is excellent and need patience with good plan and predictions to encounter the adverse situation. As the whole discussions looms around the development, The partners and the policy makers of this frame should be cautious It is an eye opener for us to move forward to know, plan and work with the situations.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
