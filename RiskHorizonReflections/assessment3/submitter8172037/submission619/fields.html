    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to be proactive in my actions.<br />- if one knows the severity is less than 50%, then insure less.<br />- no need to build so many communities you cannot protect <br />- insure more if severity is more than 50% and chances is more than 50%<br />- upgrade neighbourhood to higher standards when there are more than 50% chances<br />-don't repair when cost is more than for a new development<br />- don't build new communities when there are no funds to complete and protect them.<br />- always upgrade existing communities than building newer ones.<br />- when i upgrade, there are higher chances that repair cost will be low.<br /></div>
