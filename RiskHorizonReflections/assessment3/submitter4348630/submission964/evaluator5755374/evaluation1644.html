    <div class="field-value">the key strength is the understanding on the various elements of a risk managmeetn strategy that are information, protection, insurance, and behind this the coping strategy and how they all influence each other - thereofr eht eneed for trade offs.
IF the game is to reflect reality, the suggestion of sub-systems is to my view not appropriate at time where all discourses and paradigms tends to agree on the "eath system", "complex system" , "integrated planning" view of the reality ( see also the big global mile ssotnes to come between now and end of 2015, where efforts are made ot integrate DRR, Sustainable development and CCA frameworks.</div>
