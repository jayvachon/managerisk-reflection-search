    <div class="field-value">I'm not sure the moral of lesson here, is that insurance is the key.  I think protection is the key, at least for this game.  If you invest in protection, then it's like preventing the fire before the fire occurs and causes a lot of damage.  Insurance while helpful, works by essentially pooling in money from the community during good times, in order to rebuild after damage has occurred.   So you can think of insurance as a buffer, that helps smooth out shocks, whether they are positive or negative.   

I think the readings basically have told us that there's much more benefit in protection than there is in insurance, simply because the cost efficient of protection is much much more, while insurance is guaranteed to be probably 1:1.  By 1:1 I mean for each dollar of damage that occurs, 1 dollar of insurance is used to pay for that damage, while protection often times the ratio is 1:3, where for every dollar spent, it saves 3 dollars of damage.  

Just my two cents.  I gave you full marks.  </div>
