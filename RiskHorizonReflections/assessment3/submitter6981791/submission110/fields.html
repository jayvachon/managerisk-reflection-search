    <h1>Submission 110 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6981791, session_user_id: 2cf60c67356812c82d682f6ea62eba17793ce06f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game, what I learn about risk management is the importance of protection and insurance which at least reduces the losses or even cover all the losses that I could suffer. When you are trying to get first is building your main source of income, then build the protections needed, next use insurance to cover losses, and the last is increase your income here. In the game, protections become urgent when the meteors in a higher level hits your buildings and you will need insurance to at least reduce your losses. If you don't do that, your losses will be very hard to recovered back from its former state. At the first time, I was focused on building one pods, then do not use protection, because I was thinking that the protection wastes money, and I was using insurance alone. I suffered a lot and cannot reach at least level 5. My income was very slow because of meteors' attack into my building. The second time I played, I was diverging more pods, but still focus first on one to ensure my income is strong, then I buy protection and insurance as the game plays, I was failed in the level 5 because I don't have enough time to repair all the losses that I were suffered from meteor attacks. The key here is to protect your income from losses that could occur in the real life and don't hesitate to buy it as early as possible because you can't predict risk at all. I learn that protections are very important because it could help me (and my family) from suffering too much losses. Insurance helps me to cover losses faster, and I was able to create faster income when the losses are covered. You should not despise protection and insurance that are covered in the real life, they are important for covering most of your risks.<br /><br />What I hope in the next version of the game is added way of increasing income and more risks that could I face in the game itself. I will persuade people to buy insurance, because Indonesian people don't think that insurance is important for their life. They despise insurance and always give excuses to not buy this. I think because they don't know how important is risk management in their life. I think that I am responsible to teach them about the importance of insurance and help them to protect their-selves using the coverage of insurance. The faster you buy insurance, the better it is.</div>
