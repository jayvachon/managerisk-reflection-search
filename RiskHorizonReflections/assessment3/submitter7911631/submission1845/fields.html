    <h1>Submission 1845 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7911631, session_user_id: 7ac0dc01a0e1ed54e9d23caf05e008d3755a32b8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was basically to prevent crises where it is possible, Minimize the impact of crises where the crises is inevitable and also managing the effect of the crises by building resilience. All these could be done by using the tools of research and insurance. In the course of the game which is more like a real life situation, I had to make choices that enabled me to achieve the objectives of risk management. the choice of the class of insurance to buy puting into considerations the amount of money or resources available for the development of the pods, and with the help of cost benefit analysis and also failing in the cause of protecting the pods i was able to set my priority right and develope a good policy that helped in protecting and developing the pods with the available resouces. hence with the knowledge of risk management in the situation in the game i had make the preparation for risk my priority, then buying insurance and developing the pods, and these took someting after suffering devastating effect and shock of the risk.<br /><br />I played the game more than once, infact after failing several times i had to change my policies, i had to do things deiferently from the way i started which obviosly was not working. I concentrated more on preparation for the risk based on the reseach result or anticipated inpact of the risk. I also changed tha class of the insurance i buyÂ  to enable me have more resouces for developjng the pods. my strategy was chaged to: 1. preparation for the risk, 2. Developing the pods, and 3. buying insurance to ease the effect of the risk and help in rebuilding and developing the pods in case of any damages.<br /><br />If I were to deveope a new version of the game, i would propose the opportunity to choose where one can build and deveope pods, building and developing pods in high risk area and low risk area, so one could choose how to manage the available resources in managing risk for the high and low risk area, it will task the policy makers or risk manager on where to increase preparation, insurance and other tools of risk prevetion and managemnt given the available resources.<br /></div>
