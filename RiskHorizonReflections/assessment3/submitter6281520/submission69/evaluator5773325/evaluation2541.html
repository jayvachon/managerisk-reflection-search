    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is understanding of game. student could understand importance of taking into account all 3 factors of play. However, he/she has not mentioned whether he/she could able to cross first level. Student's idea of including invisible comet is not useful because when you do not know when risk will arise, you are not prepared for it and suffer maximum damage. Logically speaking, you will never waste your precious resources in anticipation of risk - which may come, may not come. You will use it for development purposes. 
This reflection could have included evaluation of all 3 possible resources in order to prevent maximum damage because as an illuminator, you are using precious resources of public i.e. dollars and they should be used in such a way that you get maximum protection with minimum expenditure.  </div>
