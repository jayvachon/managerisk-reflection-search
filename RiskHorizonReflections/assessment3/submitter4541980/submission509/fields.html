    <h1>Submission 509 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4541980, session_user_id: 82856c77a4d64cc1fb858cc5b036f801d01dc26f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management played a critical role in building the pods and the development of the community, which in turn helped me in moving to higher levels of the game until it is complete. I have performed research on the comets, which helped me in dealing with the impact; I have raised the elevation of the island based on the severity &amp; the hit chance characteristics of the comet thereby protecting the pods; I have obtained insurance to cover any damages caused by the comets and I have connected the pods in the community in the event of the damage so that the community is more robust going forward. The sooner I carried out research on the comets, added the insurance and raised the elevation of the development, the better it became in building the community, surviving the water damage caused by the comet hits and completing the development to move on to the next level and eventually resulting in reaching level 6.<br /><br />I have played the game more than once. After the first time, I understood that I needed to balance the acts of adding/enhancing pods to build the community, researching comets' characteristics and accordingly increasing the elevation of the community to avoid any potential damages caused by the waves due to the comet hits, and getting the right insurance to cover the damages if any. After carrying these actions in real-time in a concerted way, I was able to build the community and meet the development goals of every level and finally reached level 6. The key to success being adding more pods and or enhancing the pods there by reaching the community development goals of a given level and also getting the right protection by raising the elevation of the development and purchasing insurance such that any damages caused by the comets are repaired/replaced by the insurance policy.<br /><br />Some of the things I would add/change to the game in order to enhance the risk management are - ability to raise the elevation of the island at a faster rate so that the waves causing water damage due to comet hits cannot reach the community and also add a new insurance option that covers 100% repair and or replacement costs. A novel option that could be added to the game is the ability to create mobile pods such that these pods can be moved far away from the comet impact points thereby protecting from the water damages and moving them back when there are no comet threats. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> </div>
