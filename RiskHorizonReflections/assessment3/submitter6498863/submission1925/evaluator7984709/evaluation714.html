    <div class="field-value">Although she has not been able to go through the next levels, but it seems she has fairly understood the concept of the game which was the effect of risk management confronting risks. She very well explains the main elements of risk management and how she has put into practice those elements in order to evaluate and understand the effects of those elements. 
Overall, she has fairly been able to address the main criteria in the game reflection, but in terms of lessons learned and possible alternative methods of playing if she was to play it again she lacks clear explanation which I believe might be because she has not been able to improve her performance as game player as she could not reach to next levels. I evaluate her response to game a good reflection.</div>
