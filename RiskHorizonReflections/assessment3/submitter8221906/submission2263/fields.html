    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The choice I made was to establish and  sustain a connection between the powers given: research, protection and insurance.  So that it would be possible to combine capacity to prepare in advance of a strategic with the ability to cope the shock.  The preparation in advance include knowledge, protection and insurance of the risk. <br />After the first time I played, I realized that I need to have or create a strategic and use all the resources i was given in order to prevent eventually damages or be able to cope afterwords. <br />What I would propose could be a different scenery; something more realistic according to the situation of violence or droughts living in these days in my country , that allows people to think about behaviors of community, resorces we have to cope with that situation, information given by the government and obtaining by the people to understand the proper way to face it.    <br />I think the idea of activities like the game is to learn how in differents situations someone is responsible for the decision made considering the cost benefit analysis, it menas doing a quantitative analysis of the cost of mitigation of the risk and balancing it with the benefits of the measures taken.   <br /><br /><br /></div>
