    <h1>Submission 1872 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2919366, session_user_id: 17df3a5762456585857b7d38dd18d79ae6c69edc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The game
shows how a decision maker in risk management has to perform in a very simple
way.  You can learn how your decisions affects
the development. Sometimes you take decisions that are better than others at
the time you make them but in the long run they perform poor than others. In
explanation, you can spend money in the insurance and protection in a very
early stage, the risk will have a very low impact or none, but your development
will grow less and in the long run you are not going to have develop enough. Making
decisions always comes with a trade-off, you have to aim for the perfect.</span></p>

<p>At the first
time I played the game, I was playing very conservative. I was taking the 75%
insurance as soon as possible. Also was maxing protection more than I should.
My development was suffering because of this and at the end I was not able to
make it in the final levels. I have learnt that playing very conservative,
maxing protection and insurance from the very beginning, comes with a trade-off,
poor investment. But develop my buildings with minimal protection and a low
insurance was not performing better. At the end I have learnt that you have to
take enough knowledge to reduce the needed cost of protection and insurance to
be able to invest more effective.</p>

<p>In the
current implementation of the game I feel that the community is not very well
represented. Right now the community support is based on how quick you can click
at the right area in your screen. I think this is not a good representation. Community
support not relies on how quick communities can interconnect between them but
also how strong are the links, how big are this communities, how prepared are
them for the kind of risk, etc. Definitely, this is something I would change.<br />In relation
with the changes to represent better the risk management choices that matter in
the place I live, I think that the current game already represents the different
aspects of risk management like knowledge, investment, protection and
mitigation. Is true that I have little knowledge about how risk management is
performed in my area, but thanks to this course I’m starting to learn a lot
about it. Then, in the future I might change my mind about this.</p>
