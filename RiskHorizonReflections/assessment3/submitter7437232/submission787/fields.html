    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I think the most important issue is priority. what we should do first and second...?what is the risk? and how much is it important? at first we should choose a strategy to build pods. there is 2 options: 1-build too many and then try to upgrade them 2- build less pods but upgrade them faster. due to resources strategy the second is better option.<br />secondly we should decide about insurance. analyzing the risks of meteors we understand the island is a very risky zone. so insurance is very important, high level insurance is required.<br />I played the game more than once, i chose the strategy of pods building as said before, when i was playing for second time! it reminds me it is very important and critical to investigate about the similar projects and the experiences gained by others.<br />Due to resources high level protection needs high level income an high level pods! so we can not make a protective infrastructure in an empty island! little actions are more important at first!<br /><br /></div>
