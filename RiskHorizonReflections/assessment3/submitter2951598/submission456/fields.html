    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The game, rebuilt a perfect scenery
of real life risk, which the role of risk management were the use appropriate
of its components (knowledge, protection, insurance and coping) to reduce or
eliminate the risk,   consequently producing development and
innovation.  </span></p><p>Knowledge were the first component
which I used, the research is essentials to know the risk and its
characteristics. Know about the risk provides the creating of strategies to
confront it, in right time and with the certain component or both.</p><p>The research showed me the mains
characteristics of risk proposed for the game (the asteroid), based on this
descriptions (asteroid’s speed, asteroid’s damage power and probability to
reaching the planet) I chose the best of components or mix of both to mitigate
the risks or when possible eliminate one.</p><p>When the asteroid’s characteristics
were, speed low, high damage power and high probability of impact, my
investments were directed to researches to development, to develop ways to
avoid the impact or mitigate the damage (protection) and assurance of low
costs.</p><p>In a scenery where the asteroid’s
speed and power damage were high, there were not choices, I invested in
protection to reduce damage, and insurances of high cost to accelerate
development after damage.</p><p>First, without know about the
behavior of the risk, the use of components of risk management were totally confused,
though after sometime the use of components became itself coherent and more
efficient.</p><p><b>            </b>I played the game more than one time to try to
improve the use of available tools. In the first time, I used every tools
together and I forgot the cost them and the right time to use them. After some
attempt, I managed the costs and I passed to use both tools appropriately with
the scenery of risk, as a conclusion I saved equity to invest in development to
achieve the proposed goal.</p><p><span>            The
game exampled me clearly the main principles of the risk management and how to
use it, in addiction how the risk management provides development to a country
or a company, collaborating to avoiding and mitigating damage of various
origins.</span></p><p>















</p><p><span>To Improve the game, I think interesting  create one more tool to estimate the
percentage of efficiency of the risk management strategic plan chosen by the
gamer and show how each plan would be costly, to force the gamer face the game
like a risk too, and find a strategic more viable, this form the user will be
developing too.</span></p><div><div><div>
