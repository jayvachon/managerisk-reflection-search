    <h1>Submission 1292 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7594950, session_user_id: 3a4f32702b2c75190fb838668d38fabf273d094d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management role
includes knowledge, development and insurance; from my side I tried to work on
development building and fixing however, risk is too high which bring hopeless
to the mind, somehow feeling like, why should I fix if immediately after fixing
damage is higher!! I think this is why in development countries, even if risk management plan is available, it is 
not applied. It is not only the cost, yet also feeling like it will not work.</p>

<p><span>I passed level 2 from
the first time, then I failed in level 1 three times, I’m not sure I’m doing
the right thing, but I found that when I built many plots, and had the highest
insurance without developing further my plots or connecting them, this was when
I passed level 2; further games I tried to strengthen the infrastructure by
enhancing each plot together with the insurance, yet this was I think the point
of failure L.</span></p>

<p><span>In terms of changing
or adding one simple thing for the game to fits risk within my country, Egypt; I
think gave fits more natural disaster; the complexity of the game makes me feel
I’m trying to make a risk management plan for the end of world day J in Egypt, I think it should be different to match the different risks
other than the natural disaster; it concerns, security, controlling demonstrations…
lots unregulated aspects actually, and of course unemployment which is almost
my case. </span></p><span>
