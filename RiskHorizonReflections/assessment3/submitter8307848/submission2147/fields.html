<p><span>Risk
management plays a crucial role in this game. It was in fact it was a
challenging experience to learn how risk management is important for one’s healthy
development through this game. The tutorial given for <span>assistance helped to learn about the game more in deep.
Being the<span> luminator of
Alora, my task of developing this
community</span> by meeting certain milestones in the ways was really hard and
thought provoking.</span></span></p>

<p>Before
considering ever building the pods we certainly need to ensure adequate
measures like sufficient amount of cash is there with us. It was necessary
throughout the game to balance risk with and development. And the time
available to make sure this risk protection was limited.</p>

<p>Alora
falls victim to falling comets, these comets careen into the water and cause
waves that hinder development. So it was certainly necessary to balance between
growing the community and preparing for these potential shocks.</p>

<p>The
power to look out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the
time until impact, and the severity of the comet helped to analyse the
different scenarios and take appropriate measures on time to overcome it. By
doing research we could come to know the measures taken in different periods of
time to mitigate the risk and helping boosting protection.</p>

<p>By undertaking
insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the
chances of being hit. It also helped to reduce the cost of repairing the
damaged pods. Before considering each of this decisions we certainly have to
consider the resources since its availability is limited. It certainly need to
be put into best possible usage.</p>

<p>Playing
the game for the first time you will certainly find it difficult to access the
amount of risk involved and possible consequences of it you may have to face if
hit by the unforeseen factors, But given a chance to play again you will
certainly try to do more research and ensure adequate protection for meeting
attacks of damage based on previous experiences.</p>

<p>Main
things learned from this game include strategies to be adopted in different
risk situations, measures to be taken in such situations, knowledge about
different ways to manage risk etc.</p>

<p>If given a chance to develop
a new version of game we could probably include the role of self-help groups
within the community who could probably pool adequate money and help each
members with the group financially in times of need. They could also take up a
group insurance policy to anticipate and manage their risk. They could discuss
within the groups their past experiences of risk and share within their group</p>
