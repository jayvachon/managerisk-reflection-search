    <h1>Submission 2059 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7807364, session_user_id: 9645e55e27b0b179c10f87eeb32078eddfb3470f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game, players were
challenged to use the key elements in risk management.  The game provided the capacity to prepare in
advance by starting you off with cash which facilitated purchase of properties
(development).  Players were also
provided with information about the upcoming shocks (comets) which facilitated
preparation in advance of the shocks. 
The game also allowed the communities to become involved to adequately
cope with the comets when they hit.  The
game clearly showed in order to be successful, one had to strike that delicate
balance among development, preparation and coping strategies. </p>

<p>In level 1, I initially attempted
to gather as much information as possible about the comets, purchase insurance
and cope with the hits without building any protection.  This was clearly a mistake because the
communities did not have the capacity to eliminate the damage.  I was capturing too much research and not
balancing between preparation and coping. 
Eventually, in order to move beyond this level, I realised that I could
have glanced at the comet to get the statistics of it in terms of severity and
possibility of impact and use that information to protect the community and
obtain insurance.  Every so often, I
would continuously examine the comet to see if the statistics had changed and
adapt the protection to suit.  When I was
comfortable with the protection, I would then stay fixed on it to gather the
research which enabled the community to cope with the impact.  This approach usually resulted in no damage
to the community.  My major challenge was
to develop the community.  I was so
preoccupied with minimising the risk, I would not develop the community.             </p>

<p>I found that once I was prepared
for the shock, I could have used my cash to develop the community.  Also, once the player took heed of the
information provided about the shock and poised herself with adequate preparation
for the comets, damage to the community would have been eliminated.  Even when there was damage, the insurance
helped to hasten the development process. 
Additionally, once you realised that you were not in a position to
protect the neighbourhood completely, you had the option to increase the
insurance which would facilitate faster repairs to the buildings.  I was also concerned that when I was building
protection, the indicator used to be red, however, eventually it would turn to
green which is really a valuable lesson in risk management.  The benefits of protection sometimes come
after.</p>

<p>I completely loved this game,
however, I was frustrated at times since I was not sure what was required to
keep the indicator green.  As far as I
was concerned, I was doing everything that was required yet the indicator was
not green.  In this case, I would provide
hints for each level.  Also, when the
player loses a level I would not restart the game.  I would give the player the opportunity to
replay that particular level.  In terms
of making the game more challenging, instead of enhancing the building, the
player would have to start installing infrastructure, for example, water and
sanitation, electricity and roads.</p></div>
