    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the author is able to articulate strategies of the game itself. 
One thing I think would make this reflection better is to build a structure of risk management process. For example, if better understanding the whole process and ways of thinking in risk management, insurance is not necessary for every risk, will apply on the situation balancing the severity and the chances of risk itself, and then decide whether we need an insurance. And similar to research, research will take resources but contribute to protect, so cost-effective analysis is necessary.  </div>
