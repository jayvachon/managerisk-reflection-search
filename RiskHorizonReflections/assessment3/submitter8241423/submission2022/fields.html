    <h1>Submission 2022 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8241423, session_user_id: 1baa5e55a90e46b9f9259b4f6cc2cf375eb7708f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>MY REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME</p>

<p>The role of the risk management in the game is to develop
and protect the community against all obstacles. By building and upgrading the
pods to increase the rate of development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The choice I made was to stand to build the community and
putting all protective measures in place to balance the growth and prepare for
potential shocks.</p><p>To protect and creating a healthy community despite the waves that hinder the development and create a huminator lagacy.  <br /></p>

<p> </p>

<p>The trade-off I confronted in terms of knowledge,
preparation and Insurance was to let go of my resources in order to again.</p>

<p>In terms of knowledge I was able to forecast the next
hit, In terms of preparation, I was able to create connections and with Insurances
I was able to repair my damage pods.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Preparation generally allows me to learn the chances of
protecting the community immediately and developing the community after some
time.   </p>

<p> </p>

<p>What I did differently after the first time I played the
game was to study the chance of the comet stocking the earth, I was able to predict
and took the advantage to create connection to boost my protection.</p>

<p>I was also able to protect against the waves by raising
the Island in order to protect the pods from damage.</p>

<p>Besides that, I also took advantage of the Insurance to
quickly repair my damage pods.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The change I will propose or an aspect I will want to include
would be that the people in the community should be empowered in such a way
they during the down time they will have resources to stand the situations.</p>
