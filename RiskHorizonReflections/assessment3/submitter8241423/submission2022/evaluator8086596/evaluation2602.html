    <div class="field-value">I think that the key strength of this reflection was how the student understood the opportunity cost of risk management and how effective risk management could be extremely beneficial in cases of disasters.
I thought that the student's essay lacked detail and also how the game reflected the real world. I also think that the recommendation that the student gives to improve the game is very non pragmatic and shows the student's lack of knowledge about the conditions of communities in developing countries The student does not understand that the governments of many developing countries are struggling to maintain the economy that they are not able to provide its residents with enough resources to prepare them for such disasters. People themselves have to put in the effort to prepare themselves for the same.
The poor command over the English language made understanding the reflection difficult and at some instances I was not able to understand what the student is trying to communicate.</div>
