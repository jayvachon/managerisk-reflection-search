    <h1>Submission 471 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5634943, session_user_id: 9c77f2798f136881bda98df43c32772610fd17ea)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>GAME REFLECTION</strong><br /><p>This
Game reinforces the concept of knowledge, Protection and insurance according
the definitions provided in the course materials. The role of Risk Management
in this game shows that risk and opportunity go hand in hand.</p>

<p>The
choice I made in the game is to spend all my money on either building the Pods
or preparing for the comets to hit. I tried to build and upgrade as many pods
as I could early in the game, so that I have enough growth generated from the
Pods to proceed the next level. I invested heavily in protection. Your first
priority should be to focus on building the pods as fast as possible.</p>

<p>The
main thing I learned from the game is that Risk Management can save lives as
depicted in the game, where Alora is at risk from the falling comets and
causing damage and shock to the community and endangering lives. The only way
to succeed is to find the perfect balance. Consider the case of Bangladesh in
real life situation, where improved preparation for natural hazards had
significantly reduced the loss of life and property from the Cyclones.</p>

<p>My
reflection on the game is that you learn that Risk management is the process of
confronting risks, preparing for them, and coping with their effects. People,
societies and countries gain the ability to recover from negative shocks by
becoming resilient and they also retain the ability to function under risky
circumstances.</p><span>
