    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><br /><br /></div><div>The role of risk management in the game is giving us a very  good example of the real situation speaking of taking and managing risk. In every situation the impact of any risk can be amplified or reduced depending on what my decisions are talking about the money, the research (internal conditions), meteorits (external enviroment) in order to succeed in risk managment and get positives results.<br />The choices I made and the trade-offs I confronted in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance were the constant decisions of doing research or not, buying inssurance, investing in upgrading the pods etc.<br /></div><div>The <span> preparation for risk affect development in many ways, for instance if I decided to buy insurance and a meteorit hit the reparations will be so cheap so I could have enough money to do it.<br /></span>I played the game a couple of times and <span> I did many things differently for instance I do more research the second time, I made more conections between the people in order to diminish the damage when a meteorit hit.<br /></span><div>Risk managment is effective when it combine capacity to prepare in advance with an ability to cope afterwards; preparation includes knowledge, getting information on risk (I do research on the asteroids) but then using that information to make judgments (I decide if purchase or not inssurance), obtaining protection (with inssurance, rising the pods, making conections with people around), mesures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, mesures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times.<br />The main things I learned from the game were that every resourse  was important in different measures but a combination of all were the best option to risk management effectively and succesfully.<br /></div></div></div>
