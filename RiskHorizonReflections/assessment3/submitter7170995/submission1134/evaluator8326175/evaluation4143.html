    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is that the person understood that the combination of different measures which are part of risk management is important and is reflected in the game.

The reflection could have been better if the points were more precise and arranged properly. The clarity is missing. Even though the content is nice, it would have been better if it could have been put up properly.</div>
