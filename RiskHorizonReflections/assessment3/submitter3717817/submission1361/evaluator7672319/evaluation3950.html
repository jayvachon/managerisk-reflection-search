    <div class="field-value">I think you explained very well the progress and the changes you had to make in order to get best results in the game and that shows that you understood the risk management process as shown in our course. And I agree with you suggestion that the game could have benefited from more time being allocated to the player after each comet hit. Overall, I found your reflection to be very insightful and it looks like it helped you learn a lot about the practical applications of the theories and ides we have been learning. Well done!</div>
