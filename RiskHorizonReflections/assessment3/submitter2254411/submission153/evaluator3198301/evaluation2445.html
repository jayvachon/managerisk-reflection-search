    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection are the good arguments. You didn't just state that the game didn't work for you, and meant that it could be improved. You actually put down reasons why, and put forth possible other ways of designing the game. 

The reflection was a bit short. Considering that it was aimed at being 400 - 600 words. But even so, you did a great job.</div>
