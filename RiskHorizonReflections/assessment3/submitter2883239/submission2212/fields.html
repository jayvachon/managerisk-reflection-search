    <h1>Submission 2212 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2883239, session_user_id: 1f39b03336ae22215bc34b90344c7cb6584a31e5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Alora, an imaginary island is prone to destruction form meteor
shower. As Luminator I have the task of its development by way of building and
upgrading pods at every level. In addition to this I am also responsible for
paving the way for the least damage if a meteor strike is certain. The task of
protecting Alora and developing it at the same time is achieved by the
following ways:</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Building pods and upgrading them subject to the
availability of money, the level of development to be achieved and time
constraint</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Investing in insurance in the right amount. It
is necessary to identify the right amount because of the limited availability
of money.  </p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Research which is gathered by way of observation</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Protection by way of raising Alora to a optimum
height</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Networking in the event of a strike</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Building resilience to withstand a disaster.</p>

<p>Choices that were made were subject to factors like severity
of strike, chance of hit etc. My choices were customised according to factors
like time, development, research, money. I played through all the levels so the
choices that were recurrent were upgrading of pods, raising the level of Alora,
research. Speaking of trade-off, the one that strikes my mind is insurance
which I used only once. Others would be lack of optimum research when the
meteor was moving very fast. I always chose raising the level of Alora as means
of protection. This affected development as I was constantly using up the money
I was entitled to use. Moreover, the research also got hampered during this
time. </p>

<p>As I mentioned that I have completed all the levels. In the
first attempt I made it till level 4. Here I was using up the money on
insurance, so I couldn’t upgrade the pods hence the development goal was not
achieved. In the next attempt I stopped investing in the insurance which I used
only in level 6. In this whole attempt I focused on upgrading the pods at the
same time I maintained an optimum height of the island to avert damage caused.
With this strategy I sailed across quite easily.</p>

<p>The game conveyed the idea of risk management in a very
simple way. Introspectively, I learned that money which is a medium of
exchange; is of extreme importance and at the same time scarce and negligent
use of it can be a massive obstacle to development. Once I was convinced that I
was moving with the required pace for development I used my time in protection
of Alora. Time management is of equal importance. All the development process
has to in tune with time available otherwise all the hard work will go in vain.</p>

<p> Everything that I learned
by playing the game has taught me life lessons which I can apply in my daily
life. Time is the most important factor for me and progress has to be made for
self development. Achievement of short term goals paves the way for the bigger
picture. Social connections can be of great help in times of need. Therefore
having support of friends, neighbours is a must. Keeping in touch with the
current affairs is a great necessity as it allows the perception of an eminent danger
lurking in the horizon. Money is also an important factor which makes it
possible for attainment of the necessities of life. </p><p>Given the task of developing a new version I would add a section which could provide an analytical study of the level completed so that the player knew where she had to focus.</p></div>
