    <div class="field-value">My key takeaway from this reflection is the idea of striking a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance. That is pivotal in development. I also believe the reflection could go deeper to argue that having a proper balance of the three aspects of knowledge, protection and insurance would not only enhance the risk-management process, but would also unleash many great opportunities. </div>
