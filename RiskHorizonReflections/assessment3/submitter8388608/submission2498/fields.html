    <h1>Submission 2498 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8388608, session_user_id: 9e75769949351f0a4a2f723068b55f583eae5173)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game was very educative as it teaches the importance to manage risks in the most efficient way. It was very challenging in all its aspects. The game comprises the concept of risk management in all the levels, thereby giving me an ultimate exposure of different stages of risks and their after-effects. A strategy game that inculcates within itself the challenges that could be symbolically related to the instances in our daily life. Being the Luminator of Alora, the task given was to develop the community by foreseeing risks and to make sure that there is advancement in the society. It was a very thought-provoking game as it enables us to take decisions and take the right amount of risks by researching on them. By building pods, the rate of development would increase and thereby making the environment much safer.<strong></strong><div>It was important to note that there should be a sense of balance throughout as we had to check for few parameters before we could develop and safeguard the land. This aspect taught me the significance of responsibility that we possess in our lives to take care of the environment we live in and also to take considerable amount of risks on an everyday basis. Not only should we prepare the community to bear the shocks but also nurture them to handle the post-shock effects. It is indeed really important to research on the risks that come our way and eventually develop on a protection plan to minimize the damages from it. Insurance is also a key element in the game, as it ensures and safeguards the land from major damage. It will be cheaper and quicker to rebuild the pods after damage. Striking a balance between them all and performing each action with utmost care was indeed a very challenging task. </div><div>While playing the game, it was also important to do proper time management as we had a time constraint in developing the land of Alora and also to protect them from the waves caused by the meteors. So within the stipulated time, good research, protection, development and insurance against the damages were to be done in the best possible way. Good research was mandatory as it educated us with the performance and the severity of the meteors and how it could affect the environment. Preparation of risks also helped in money management. Building the right number of pods with the given budget and also to insure them was a decision that we had to take after much observation and thought. </div><div>While playing the game for the first time, I had restricted myself to only 25% insurance, but as I moved on, it was important to take bigger risks and hence had to increase the insurance to 75%. Though building pods was important to develop the land, insuring them against meteor waves was equally important. Thereby, it was important for me to strike a sense of balance between time, money and the resources at all points during the game. </div><div>If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would have made it comparatively more realistic by introducing real life situations of protecting a city or environment and have obstacles and risks in relation to the real-life scenarios. I would have also introduced few other concepts in which the players could make some money as they deal with damages. </div></div>
