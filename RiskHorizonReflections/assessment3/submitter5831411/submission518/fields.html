    <h1>Submission 518 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5831411, session_user_id: 1608a0e3148d2a5d5a1a242871d288eb70c81659)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game experience was very interesting and helpful because the game shows how to manage the risk in different situations and clarified that it is not the same to manage for a low risk than for a high risk, also that it is almost always better and cost effective to be prepared. The trade offs I did were to buy different type of insurances depending on the risk and also investing on research in order to be able to avoid damage, sometimes the meteorite missed and didn't impact the land so all the preparation I did was helpless, however when it did hit the land I was sometimes able to avoid damage and when that was not possible then the insurance I got helped me greatly to recover with a significant low inversion, which would be way bigger without the insurance.<br />It is very different to play the game only once than to play it more times, I actually lose the game at the second level in my first time because I did not know very well how the game and the system worked, however even thought in my first time I failed it was a really good learing experience and I was able to advance more in the game in the following tries. What I did different was trying to avoid the errors that made me lose the last times and improve my strategy every time. Something very important to mark out is that even if you lose one time the game it is not totally a lose because you can take it as a learing experience and use that new knowledge to improve your tactics in the next time. Another important thing is that you don't have to be pesimistic and always try to learn and be succesful even if you are not on the first times.Â <br />One option that can be added is a level of difficulty because not all the people want to reach the same point and therefore the risks and opportunities they will face will be also different. Other option could be something more about decision making and add more types of pots because they all are the same with the same characteristics, I would like to have some other types of constructions (inversions), so that I could choose depending on my growth expectatives on a specific point of the game.Other than that, it was very good.</div>
