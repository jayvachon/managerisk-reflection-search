    <h1>Submission 1918 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8280908, session_user_id: 720ecc106fc4ccad566e20cb6985c8a9e948f2da)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game four times. In these four attempts, I tried different combinations of pod development and risk management.<br /><br />In my first attempt, I had many pods, but they were poorly developed and I did risk management using mostly insurance and protection. This approach failed fairly quickly, as the first more destructive meteorite crippled my economy and I did not have enough money to repair my pods or to buy insurance on the next level.<br /><br />On my next attempt, I used the same pod development strategy, but I used research in risk management more extensively and I tried to get by with buying cheaper insurances. The outcome was fairly similar to my first attempt,  a destructive meteorite left me financially broke.<br /><br />Over the next two attempts, I tried slowing down my expansion and I invested more money in developing the pods. Furthermore, I tried balancing research and protection better, while only buying cheap insurance policies, unless I saw that the impact of a very destructive meteorite is imminent.<br /><br />Overall, I think the trade-off between development and risk management was fairly obvious, as I often did not have enough money to develop my pods or to improve my protection, especially if a destructive meteorite hit the world and I had a cheap insurance policy and/or I had too many pods. This forced me to balance carefully, nevertheless I think I still lent towards the "safe" approach (few, highly developed pods, cash in the bank).<br /><br />I think the game would better represent the place where I live if it had different types of threats. Most Hungarian people would name flooding the most obvious risk we face, but diseases, crime, etc. are all present in our lives. In the game, however, there is only one type of risk, which makes preparing for it easier, as all the resources can be used to prepare for it. Furthermore, in the game there are no obstacles to development and risk management. The player can do whatever (s)he wants to do, without the resistance of the pod dwellers, the government or some other actor. That certainly is not the case in Hungary. The people, the local government, the national government and the international community often have conflicting opinions on what the biggest risks are, which approach should be taken, who and how should finance it, etc. Involving a third actor in the game that occasionally resists the player's decision could demonstrate this dynamic of real life. <br /><br /><br /></div>
