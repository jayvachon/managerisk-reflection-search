    <h1>Submission 2113 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8351978, session_user_id: cdecc32364ffecdaf5eb588b1f5e2c68b31ae378)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1. The role of risk management was at the heart of the
game.  At every point of the game, you
needed to balance between building and upgrading pods (development) and protecting
your investment through research (knowledge) or raising the island
(protection).  When this failed,
insurance was the fallback to mitigate losses.  Initially, I emphasized the development aspect
because it was necessary to further build pods. 
However, as comets entered play, I would invest in research despite the
cost.  I would click on the comets to see
what the severity of the impact would be. 
If it was high, I would increase the level of protection.  Knowledge was key to being prepared, even if
it meant just spending a few seconds on a meteor.  Without any knowledge, it was a complete guesswork
as to whether or not the level of protection was adequate or if insurance was
needed.  With knowledge at hand, I could
make an educated decision that would lower the risk of damage and also lower my
costs.  Ideally, it was by investing in
protection, since damages not only set me back financially but also affected my
development level. Also, protection carried over to the next levels as opposed
to insurance that needed to be renewed. If it was clear that I would not have
enough time to protect myself, I would make an informed decision on how much
insurance to take based the severity of the shock and the likelihood. </span></p>

<p><span>For example, if the severity was at a bar 6, I kept in mind that
my research (and community connections) could provide me up to 2 bars of
protection. Therefore, I used my slider to raise the island up to bar 4 before
the shock. If I didn’t have enough time to reach that level, I purchased an
insurance plan. This technique would minimize the damage and bring me to the
next level.  Finally, once my development
was at its maximum for a given level, I would divert all my remaining time to
raising my protection in anticipation for the next level.</span></p>

<p><i> </i></p><p><i>2. </i>I played the
game several times (probably too much!) and it took me a while to really
understand the causes and effects of the different functions. In the beginning,
I was building too fast and didn’t really know how to use the research function
or I invested too much in protection/insurance. I mostly learned how to
interpret the information and that not every comet required an action on my
behalf. When I felt like I was not making any progress, I had to go back and
read the instructions. It gave me a better and clearer understanding.  The main thing I learned was the importance of
understanding the correlation and interaction between the various factors that
come into play in a given situation.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><i>3. </i>I would
propose that whenever a player fails a level, he would go back to a previous
level, not necessarily always the first one (random?) because failing to
achieve a goal in life doesn’t always send you back to square one.   <br /></p></div>
