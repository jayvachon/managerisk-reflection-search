    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is a very detailed description of the game, presented as a practical learning tool that helps to apply the learning to real life scenarios. The reflection has clearly introduced the threats and vulnerabilities that the population of the planet is facing. It also explained the role of knowledge, risk reduction and response. This short essay could be further improved by adding some personal reflection on the individual experience of playing the game, some thoughts on what the student has learnt from the game about effective risk management, what challenges he/she faced in terms of the trade-offs between knowledge, protection and insurance and what is the main learning that he/she is taking away from the game.</div>
