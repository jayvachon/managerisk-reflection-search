    <div class="field-value">The author has written a clear reflection, describing the events of the game with their perceptions. But I believe that the author rushed to say that the insurance was not a useful tool: in fact, it prevented the player's score decreased, helping to pass level faster, preventing higher expenses with repairs. Maybe reevaluate this fact is the only improvement I have to point out.</div>
