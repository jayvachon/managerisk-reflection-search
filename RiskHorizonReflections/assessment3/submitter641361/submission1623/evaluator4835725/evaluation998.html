    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the student made long term reflections of the game. What I mean is that they were able to realize that  the more research that gets done into the comets also overtime diminishes the future impacts of comets, and not just the immediate effect of diminishing the impact. 

One thing that would make this reflection better is relating it to where the student lives, since that is what the third question states. How does adding a lump sum (from grants, donations) that is used for risk management related to the risk management choices that matter where they live? </div>
