    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Game Code = MTFS35V</p><p>The main purpose of the game is to effectively and
efficiently manage risk and its consequences. 
It is the successful balancing of development of a community with
protecting that community against threat such as natural disaster or the like
or any kind of risk.</p>

<p> The role of risk management in the game is the prediction
and management of the probability and severity of risk (catastrophic events) on
a community. </p>

<p>·        
The prediction of the risks is through
researching the risks and predicting/estimating the likely of those risks
happening and their severity and consequences on the community.  The impact/consequences can adversely impact
on the development of the community and set it back on its development progress.
</p>

<p>·        
The management of the risks consists of
developing a community by building it from grass root and protecting it against
the risks (comets threat – wave are generated by comets hitting a large water
body where a village of pod sit as an island. This is akin to the impact of
earthquake), via efficient observation of the probability and severity of the
risk, and managing that probability and severity through:</p>

<p>o  
insuring (purchase of insurance) the community for
reconstruction/rebuilding post the disastrous consequences of the risk hen it occurs;</p>

<p>o  
Working with the community (community
connection) through share information and resources soon after the event and
even during the events;</p>

<p>o  
Protecting the village via construction of
infrastructure – in this case it is consisted of raising the village to reduce
the impact of wave after a comet hit. In other case such as flooding, it will
be construction of levees/stopbanks to keep flood water in the river or to enact
legislation that requires building to be built in some particular areas and not
others, and/or to have the building floor level at certain height.</p>

<p>Preparation for risk help prepare ensure that the pods are
not affected after a comet hit or if affected the level of impact is minimal
and recovery is fast and a low cost. 
Preparation ensure all steps are taken to insure the community and build
adequate infrastructure to protect the community.  Good preparation gives confidence to build
the community and lessens the fear that paralyses against development.  The experience through the game is that with
less preparation/research, the comet threads are regular and their impacts
damaging and effort and resources are wasted on rebuilding instead of
developing the community.</p>

<p>My first attempt on the game was spent on focusing on one
component of protection – raising the village.  The second attempt was spent on trying to
develop, but the comets hits and subsequence damages sapped all my resources.  I then learn that the basis is to concentrate
on balancing development with protection against comets. Protection against
comets requires good research of their probability of impact and severity of
those impacts.  The more I research the
confident I became and can develop while protecting and insuring. I’ve reached
level 5 and while I was about to complete level 6 my computer crashed. It was
late and time for me to go to bed and work the next day.</p></div>
