    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Really, it is a very interesting game because from the information we have, we can mystify risk, using tools such as insurance, engineering. I think the most important thing,for me, was teaching the importance of good information to achieve using the tools I had. I had problems with my mouse, but as I  mentioned, the game is usefull to understand when I have to use an Insurance, how I can prevent against a risk using accertive information. </div><div><br /></div></div>
