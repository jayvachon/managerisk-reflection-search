    <h1>Submission 2000 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4545869, session_user_id: 09a2f9f7dd003e4e9e39f6802d9aaa188a6e1cc8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> Overview of the Game:</p>

<p>The game captured succinctly the relationships between Risks
and Reward. While development enhances values of lives in the Community, there is
inherent Risk that goes along with Community Development.</p>

<p>The Role of Risk Management in the Game:</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Knowledge of External Environment: The game
evidently showed that development does not happen in isolation but within an environment.
It becomes very critical as an Agent of Change in the community to scan the
environment properly for both probabilities of loss (Risk) and of gain
(Opportunities). Preparation is key and should be carefully planned.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Risk Management prevent damages: The knowledge of
danger through Research provided an opportunity to deal with risk. Through
Research, one can easily detects sources of risks in the Game- Meteor, shocks,
and, careful planning can mitigate against them.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Risk Management helps in analysis cost and
benefit. The identification of a Risk factor such as the Meteor and the probability
of causing extensive damage allow Risk Manager to anticipate cost of damage and
the benefit of protection.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Risk Management helps in Decision Making. In the
game, I was able to make an informed decision by choosing appropriate insurance
based on the perceived level of risk and the stage of development. As the
Development progresses, the value of my insurance increases to mitigate against
damage from Comets and to ensure enough coverage is available for repairs.</p>

<p>Choices: </p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I came to know through the game that Research is
important to Preparation –constantly looking out for Meteors and measuring their
distance to Earth helped my development strategy.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I made sure the ‘Development Barometer’ on the
left side of my Project Site stayed Green and constantly watched out for ‘Red’
factors.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Elevating the Island by holding the Slider on
the Right when danger of comets beckon also helped in development.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I was able to buy Insurance to repair
development damaged by floods.</p>

<p>Trade-Offs </p>

<p>Sometimes, I was able to measure and tolerate some levels of
Risk by not holding the Slider to save cost rather fill pods so very quickly,
and making sure the Meter stays green.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Preparation of Risk Affect Development:</p>

<p><span>i.                    
</span>At the onset of Development, it helps to identify
and quantify risk through Research. For example, the danger of Comets falling
and causing flood provides opportunity to mitigate against loss of development.</p>

<p><span>ii.                  
</span>As development progresses, one is able to
quantify the amount of Insurance Policy required to repair damages.</p>

<p><span>iii.                 
</span>All through the development stages, keeping an
eye on the horizons ensures constant protection.</p>

<p>2.  If I was to play the Game again, what I would
do differently?</p>

<p>a. I will not panic at the onset
of Risk.</p>

<p>b. I will be more deliberate to
do Cost- Benefit Analysis </p>

<p>c. I will be more prudent in
spending my Budget by choosing appropriate insurance for each stages of
development.</p>

<p>Lessons from the Game:</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>When there is opportunity for Development, Risk
is Inherent.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Risk is not all bad and can be quantified.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Risk can be prevented and can be transferred
through insurance to enhance development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3.   I live in
Ontario, Canada – Some of the Changes to the Game to adapt to my Environment
would be:</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I would replace Comets with Tornadoes</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>I would seek to develop Parks instead of an
Island</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Also, I might develop a system that measure Rainfall
and calibrates amount of rainfall into severity of flooding.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>Finally, the game will have both English and
French versions to meet up with Canadian Official Language Act – Canada is a
Bilingual       Country.</p>
