    <div class="field-value">Strength:-
The reflection was well presented in terms of the fact that it tackled every question in a point wise and objective format. Also, the emphasis on cost benefit analysis (Point 2-b.) on managing budgets well is a great observation.

One thing that could make the reflection better:-
I found the answer to question 1 to be a little unclear and confusing. This was particularly so with regards to linking the role of risk management to its three components- knowledge, protection and insurance in context of the game (while one could infer these links through reading the text a few times, perhaps it could have been better presented). However, the essay quality improves as it goes along. 

Good job!! </div>
