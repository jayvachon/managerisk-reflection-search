    <h1>Submission 610 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4772367, session_user_id: aea346d9f2f19f91ce772e2b1461d0056fbcf4cd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role
of risk management was to ensure that you optimally utilize the available resources
in terms of time and money between the competing needs of development,
preparation for any shocks as well as protection just in case the shocks materialized.
This protection also included taking insurance against the shocks.  All this was about strategic thinking as far as development is concerned.  </p>

<p>I had to
make choices between continuing with the development, taking off time to research
for any incoming comets and ensuring adequate protection to the community
against the threat of shocks. So the choice was mainly about time but also
money which happen to be the key resources that are in short supply and have to
be competed for by the development needs of the community.  </p>

<p>Preparation
for risk consumed time that would otherwise have been used to develop the
community in the short run. This cost the community valuable time necessary for
development. However overtime the preparation actually contributed towards more
development as resources as money increased and the development from one level
to the other was faster and hence saving valuable time for other activities. At fist preparation seemed to be just time consuming but on realising that it was leading to more development in the longrun, it became more attractive to be emphasised. <br /></p>

<p>I played
the game more than once and the subsequent times I played I emphasized that I balanced
the preparation with development and protection which I had not done earlier. This
was by researching more about the potential shocks. I learnt that in
development, preparation for shocks as well as how you will cope is critical to
the community.<br /></p>

<p>If I were given an
opportunity to change anything in the game, I would add another resistance in
the form of community resistance to development and political interference<br /></p></div>
