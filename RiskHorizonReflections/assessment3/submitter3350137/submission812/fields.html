    <div class="field-value"><p><u>Role Of Risk Management in Game</u></p>

<p> </p>

<p>In game we have to use a balance between research, insurance
and protection. It gave us practical simulation of how to give attention to
which thing most.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Strategy used by me in game</p>

<p><b><u>Level 1</u></b> –my
whole attention was on development and protection I did not used insurance
since the level of risk was protected by in in advance.</p>

<p><b><u>Level-2</u></b> –
in this level again my particular attention was on research and development since
the problem could be mitigated by spending time on protection.</p>

<p><b><u>Level-3-</u></b>
again I used the same strategy but this time I was hit by Metroid it decreased
my development level but I managed to get it.</p>

<p><b><u>Level 4</u></b> -I
purchased insurance this time and spend less money on protection since I was
ensured my development does not go down even after getting   attacked
by Metroid. For getting more time for mitigation I spend time on research.</p>

<p><b><u>Level 5</u></b>-
same strategy matching up development with level spending money on protection
as well as insurance.</p>

<p>Level 6 cannot complete it.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I play next time I will send more on protection less on insurance.
</p>

<p>I understand how it is good to be prepared for disaster by
all ways i.e. protection as well as insurance.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Change I will propose to better represent the risk
management choices that matter in the place I live will be to make it a hilly terrain
so that ability to take decision depending on location of settlement also
effect so that people could understand that development is necessary but in a scientifically
planned way.</p>
