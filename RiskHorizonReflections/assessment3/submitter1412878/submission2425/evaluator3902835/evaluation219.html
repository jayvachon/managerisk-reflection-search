    <div class="field-value">I think the key strength of this reflection is about insurance, you didn't advance because you didn't get protection. I strongly believe you had the same problem as I did, Then I realize in a forum that theres was another link for the same game that help you with raising the protection bar in the lower right corner (first link gave me trouble with computer specs). So if you would have play with that other link, you could have realized that you had to first gain knowlege of comets, than with that information gained, for example severity of comet, you could increase protection for the community at least the same level of severity to take no damages, If that happened you had to build new pods or improve existing, which plays the role of developing since you had good risk preparation and resiliance. After you advance on every level you had to understand that as comets came faster and in more quantities, that gaves you understanding that problems may occur when you less expect them, so if your level of preparation could not match the severity you had to buy some insurance to cover the parts you could not by your own. And to recover for the very little damage caused, you had to repair first to level incomes again(coping), and then you keep improving. I think that is a kind of continuous improvement for the community. </div>
