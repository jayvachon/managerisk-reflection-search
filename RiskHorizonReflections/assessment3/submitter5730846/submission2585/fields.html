    <h1>Submission 2585 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5730846, session_user_id: 05e058e0a967dc49aad3742217aa59aa8b17a63a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">the role of the risk management in the game was balancing  the three concept of knowledge, protection and insurance. i tried to know the saverity of the risk and the probability of occur and then invest some cash on research and make appropriate insurance level.<br />i played 3 times and i managed to reach level 2, i think i could do better if i try few more times in the next time by trying to balance and  make the best possible mix for the three.<br />i bought a 75% insurance plan which is not a good idea since the probability of the damage was less than 50% most of the time. so i think the best insurance plan is 50% for the first three level. as well not investing too much in research.<br /><br />if i play the game next time i will invest 50% insurance plan and try to invest 3 level research up the 4th level of the game as well as building more update buildings. i will just try to balance the three concept. trying to know what is coming first before building and research as. i realise that the knowledge is the most important part in the game if you. you cannot invest randomly or you will suffer a loss or high damage. that is what is happen to me in the first level. so the main point is the knowledge and based on it make investment.<br /><br />i will recommend different new risk types in the new version instead of one risk which means multible risks like floods, earth quake and etc. which making it more interesting.<br /><br /></div>
