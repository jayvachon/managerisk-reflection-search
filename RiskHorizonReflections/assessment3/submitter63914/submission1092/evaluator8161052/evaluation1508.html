    <div class="field-value">The reflection is very clear and well articulated. It is made up of practical experience. The thoughts writer mention here is very broad based. It seems that he or she played the game very skillfully.
The game development ideas given here are important. I personally also suggested to think about insurance system. It should be more need based. The writers suggestion about background music seems not significant. because he or she can play the game by muting the sound.</div>
