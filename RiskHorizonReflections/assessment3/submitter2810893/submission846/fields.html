    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk
management in the game was balancing between the insurance, knowledge and
protection, The idea seems to me timely bounded, we should research the type of
the problem, how its severity, and how its probability  to cause problem
or to reach us, according to that we have to make the protection needed, on the
other hand insurance should take place to reduce the damage which may occur,
the key for me was how to balance between the three components. it was very
clear that developing the country increases its investment, it was very clear
that time is a another component, we need to search the problem and use the
right way for protection or decreasing the effect before the crisis takes
place,  good preparation was effecting immediately by protecting from the
immediate effect of the risk and has a long term effect on development and
investment, the fourth component "coping" i do not know if it was
clear in the game, but i may noticed that the way we prepare our land with a
communication between villages may increase the wealth some way, I used to play
the game three times and i could not pass the third level, always a crisis
happen and i did not knew where the problem was, is it in research ! protection
! Insurance! or the way I’m was using the wealth ! The second time i played the
game i found that i should take care with research and analyze it in a good way
putting the decision in the appropriate time. The second time I used to play
the game, I forgot to purchase the insurance in the beginning of the second
level, and this cause a quick fail, its better to have a strategy so I do not
forget the steps which I should take care with it in its right sequence, I mean
planning in advance. I suggest a new version of the game which specify the type
of buildings so  one can help in research
and go advanced with the different levels, different insurance offers,  clarifying the communications between the
villages and how it act together. I can think in the place I work, I think we
must study the problems we face and its repetition and severity so we can put
strategies to handle the risk from the immediate occurrence up to preparing
things to its first condition  using the available
opportunities.   </p></div>
