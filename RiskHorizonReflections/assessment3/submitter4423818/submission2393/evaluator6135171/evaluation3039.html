    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is on its clarity. I can easily identify and capture the main points that the writer is trying to convey (at least I hope I have understood it the same way as the writer intended to explain about).

Two things that I think would make this reflection better are:
- focus more on explaining the relevant reflection on learning from the game that can be applied to real life condition and connecting it to the risk management tools as defined in the module 
- write a clearer proposal of a change that would make the game better represent the risk management on his/her country. The writer has mentioned about the change proposed, however I don't understand how devaluing building in a random or periodic manner can represent the problem of trustworthiness and punctuality in his/her country's risk management. A further explanation on their relationship would make it much clearer.  </div>
