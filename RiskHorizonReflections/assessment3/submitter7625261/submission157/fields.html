    <h1>Submission 157 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7625261, session_user_id: 5021b591d349bd22350f5a16b1622d7eaaf0d79d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Being 56 yrs old and playing a video game like that was so difficult for me. However, I realized concretely the importance of taking risks and managing the inevitable shocks that comes. I was a very conservative player on the onset but I then realized that if I develop the community further, the community efforts far outweigh the damage. Insuring the community early on also helps a lot. Calculated protection is also very helpful. But research diminished the severity of the impact and in some cases even minimized the chances of hits. I was able to reach level 6 and I was overjoyed. <br />As to the suggestion to improve the game, perhaps a more visual community linkage pattern. More than simply an illuminator, maybe a thing or two on Alorians helping each other inspite of the damage experienced. I am of the opinion that it is not just the knowledge (research), insurance and protection that are key to the resilience of a particular community.<br />You see, I come from the Philippines and as a nation, we are still coping with the massive devastation of typhoon Haiyan. What I see here internally, is the collective effort of the Filipinos ourselves in carrying out assistance in our own spheres of influence on the victims of Haiyan. Also, measures to prepare as nation to curb and minimize the destruction that we had seen is all over the place. While we donate boats to the fisherfolks affected in Tacloban, we consider that we cannot cut more trees to make boats. We need trees to counter the floods and to be typhoon breakers. So, we thought of producing fiberglass boats for these boatmen wherein they are employed as the makers of the boats themselves. That is offering livelihood also for them. there is massive information and research going on teaching us of our position in the Ring of Fire, the earthquake zone of Southeast Asia. We are now being taught to build buildings that sway with the earth movements. We go back to our native nipa huts as models for floating homes in case of floods.<br />Also, I commend my government in its campaign against graft and corruption which contribute to awareness that we have the financial resources and enough international aid to rise as a nation. Information too on the dangers of such a big population is getting support among educated Filipinos even if our we are predominantly a Catholic nation.<br />On a more personal note, I am a college professor in a small all girls college and with the nationwide implementation of the K12 education, I ran the risk of being offered a redundancy or early retirement package since there will be 2 years that we will have no enrollees in first year coilege. With such educational reform things will normalize in 4 years. I agree with benchmarking with the ASEAN 2015. I see the importance of this reform for our next generation. I am very positive the young will have more opportunities at employment across shores that my generation. But I had to take on the initial shock of losing my job.<br />As I take on this course, I realize, I can minimize the impact of losing my job. I will improve on my research skills, finish my PhD and strengthen my network and volunteer in advocacy projects. I can also take commissioned researches on the side. Taking this MOOC by world Bank will do wonders for my resume. Now, I am more excited to try out a whole new world.  </div>
