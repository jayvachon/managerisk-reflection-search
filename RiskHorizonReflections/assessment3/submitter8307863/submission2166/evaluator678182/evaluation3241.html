    <div class="field-value">This essay shows a clear understanding of both the game and the course material. Its main weakness, lies in the fact that the first two paragraphs were used to mostly describe the game rather than to answer question one which relates to the trade offs. Thus, much to the first part of the essay was used to describe the game in general. The last two paragraphs were very effective in dealing with questions 2 and 3. </div>
