    <div class="field-value">Overall, it is a clear description of how the game is designed and how it reflects the challenges of risk management. I also found the writer's idea on designing a similar game to teach basic financial literacy/retirement planning to his/her community pragmatic and worthwhile. It is also interesting that the person who wrote this reflection mentions the 'Law of Large Numbers,' but would have been more thorough a review if s/he explained how time spent on research would have to be traded off with the time that could have been spent on development. </div>
