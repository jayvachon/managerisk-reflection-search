    <h1>Submission 2611 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3149720, session_user_id: eca313a498e361591c27211ab51107771633df10)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk
management in the game presents a different way to control risk: time,
research, capital, protection, plot building updating and insurance. It was a column
which indicates the status of your risk. </p>

<p><span>The first time that
played I could not reach the III level. I did not understand well after the
impact of the planet what to do. After I did so quickly and I get some extra
points.  I used a strategy without
insurance and protection. It was very poor because only about research and
growing plot was not sufficient to arrive to the II level.   Next I changed my strategy to the game to
consider protection and insurance, and update the plot to better building
together with research.  In this way I arrived
to III level, but it was enough to arrive at the IV level.  I need to consider the money that I need to leave
for the next level, otherwise it was almost impossible to insure my plots.  With this new strategic I arrived to the V
level and I was so happy to see my plots in a beautiful garden!  All strong and in good shape! I lost again to
arrive at maximum level because I update the plot and I forgot to leave money
to play to the VI level.  </span></p>

<p><span>I need to consider
also the growing for the plots and the money that I have to spend. It was very
interesting that if I grow my plot so fast in which the money was too low, I couldn’t
have money for the insurance to the next level.  I need to choose efficiency between the time
that I have a disposition, with the researcher, and growing. </span></p>

<p><span>The game capture all
the important risk managements, like catastrophic, liquidity, insurance,
protection and linked between the plots (community) and building protection,
but I would like to  see what is the
level of the risk, and some kind of risk diversification!.  May be it is possible to include other kind of
risks like mortality, etc.  when the
plots are getting older and/or living longer. </span></p>
