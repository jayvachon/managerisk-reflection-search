    <div class="field-value">I really enjoyed reading your reflection - it's highly reflective and you made some very interesting points. It was also interesting to see that you also only used the insurance option when all else failed - different than the other peer I just reviewed who started each level by buying insurance...

I liked how you highlighted that investing in preparation has to be balanced against developing pods and that the balance of preparation, insurance and development is the main idea of the game which we were supposed to learn.

I truly have no idea what you could have done better in your game reflection... o_O
Maybe you coulda written incoherently - so that I could have had something to criticize... :P
