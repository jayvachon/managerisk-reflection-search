    <h1>Submission 2367 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1682005, session_user_id: d81c53a026efebc6aab66b57b239550866524dc5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game was created in order to see how right risk management could save the city. It was based on decision-making process where Courserians should consider knowledge of risk, protection and insurance. We also had to find some equilibrium or trade-off between these principles, maintain it among levels and tried to be prepared for potential disaster. If this strategy was strictly maintained, we could reach higher kevel of the game.<br /><br />Considering the influence of number of games played, I have to agree that every time I lost the game I tried not to do the same mistake in the next game. And I learned one thing: "Do not be nervous about approaching asteroid but try to identify the threats, determine risk rising from that threat and find ways to reduce it."<br /><br />In my opinion, I find the game very well-designed in terms of acquiring basic knowledge about risk management. Maybe it would be more beneficial if there was more than one threat (fall of asteroid). The threat was differentiated just in the severity, not in variety. It would bring near the reality since we face a large number of threats every day.</div>
