    <div class="field-value">Your reflection is valid, although I believe the suggestion is not crucial to create a change in the behaviour of the player. The fact that there is only one adverse agent (a meteorite chosen as a representative of any possible social, economic, environmental attack) is not a schematic and trivial reproduction of reality. Indeed, if considering its likeliness of hitting and the entity of its impact, the various combinations of these two features may stand up for a various set of adverse agents. You can consider a bigger and likely hit as the result of a major economic downturn in the markets, or a smaller unlikely hit, as a minor loss incurred during the investment. Probably having more sources of attacks would not change very much the game.</div>
