    <h1>Submission 2224 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5290308, session_user_id: f375feae442f714dc5fbe1b9bd4a066a7f003a83)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk is to prevent the pods from damaging from the comets. I choose to spend more on insurance, protection than I expected. If I spend more on insurance and protection, it will be less for the development for the pods, and vise versa. I paid too little at the first chance. I knew that I need to be aware of the risks, and risks are uncertainties. Risk management is like an art of choices.</div>
