    <h1>Submission 88 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1277318, session_user_id: 0f5c6bc714e634cecc38c11e273678a41efbf374)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of risk management in the game is to build the pods and save them from damage when the meteors strike. The trade offs made were first is to gain knowledge on how the whole thing functions then protect and insure happens simultaneously as at times there is zero damage but some time s there is damage so insurance comes in handy. Preparation for risk affects after some time, insurance has to be taken before, protection can be started if we have the knowledge of the strike.<br />2. i played the game more than once, in the first instance i gained knowledge about the system. In the second instance i prepared for protection and insurance along-with developing the pods. The main things learned is to have knowledge about the environment is must, research is important to enhance it further. Protection and insurance has to be planned in advance.<br />3. I would automate the technology of protection with the research done so that when the meteor is in the strike range it automatically is deployed. We have to embrace technology in a far better way to combat risk.</div>
