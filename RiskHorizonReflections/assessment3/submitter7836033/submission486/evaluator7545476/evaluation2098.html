    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is that the student tried to integrate what happens in the game with lesson learned about risk management. And I particularly agree with the first paragraph, that we live in an uncertain world, and that we need to prepare for risk by wisely allocating our limited resources.

I think one main thing that could make this reflection better is that the answers should follow the questions more closely. It was difficult to see which sentences correspond to which questions. I don't think all questions were fully address, more specifically, I don't think the third question was even addressed.</div>
