    <h1>Submission 2324 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 417884, session_user_id: 443338ceaa75928bfba974177997e98727cb9cf1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Answering the first question, risk management is very
important for development when you can use the three mechanisms properly. I
make many mistakes when I used one of them more. That punished me badly. For
example, when I used protection without research, its potential lost power
because I could not know how to protect better. The same is the opposite: if
you just research without putting in practice that knowledge, you cannot
protect yourself from risk.  </p>

<p>Any society have to face several risk and sometimes will be
hit by a crisis so, the more prepare and able to cope to that, the easier for
this society to recover and keep developing. What I noticed from the game is
that research is really rewarding: you are not just more prepared but you earn
more financial resources for investing in developing. Besides, the functioning
of the insurance system is actually affordable. That surprised me. Even in
early stages of development, the game allow you to purchase an insurance
according to what you asses as a risk. In my case, I always bought the $175
insurance and I think I did deal because recovery was much cheaper and faster.
 </p>

<p>For question 2, I must say I played the game several times
and unfortunately, I reached only the level 2. For me, the game seems easy but
actually, is not. What I noticed from the beginning was research not only allow
you to know better the risk but give more financial resources to invest. Also that
protection works well but you must keep developing you society otherwise you
lose the game. Insurance really make you recovery more efficient and easy.</p>

<p>Finally, my answer for question 3 would be that it would be
nicer if the game allow you, in real time, to understand how much cost you all,
I mean, a statistic about how much cost you the recovery, the research, the protection
and the relationship among them in terms of cost-benefit analysis. </p>
