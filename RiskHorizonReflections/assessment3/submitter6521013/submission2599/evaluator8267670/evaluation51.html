    <div class="field-value">I think this is a fantastic reflection. The student integrates the course material very well into the game experience with clear understanding and application. I cannot think of how to improve this reflection. I particularly appreciated the suggestion to focus on research innovation and subsequent advocacy in developing a new version of the game. I work in development in the area of global health, and it is essential to bridge the gap between front line experts and lay persons. I have learned that at times these are not mutually exclusive groups. </div>
