    <h1>Submission 2599 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6521013, session_user_id: 5b5681728806e878496e62926788ac7cb5ff7bfb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. From the game, it shows that risk management is a very important tool for development.In fact sustainable development is very much tied to effective risk management. The game showed taught me the following lessons:<br /><br />Sustainable Development cannot be achieved in the absence of protection, insurance and research. These three components integrated together are able to reduce threats arising from natural disasters. <br />Research is particularly important because, high level of development is tied to how much research and information about impending disasters we have. I noticed from the game that i attain development faster with research and integrating other components in development. I also noticed that having development without adequate insurance poses a great risk when natural disaster  strikes. Usually much financial resources is involved from the loss of physical capital.<br /><br />2. I played the game severally without crossing the level 2 point. They rate at which the diseasters occurred were such in a high speed. If i played again, i will not concentrate more on physical asset development, but will effectively combine research, protection and moderate insurance cover to attain significant development. I think  I focused more on physical assets accumulation and protection and less of research and insurance.<br /><br />3. I will focus more on research innovation because with adequate information about impending disasters, come better and innovative approaches to physical asset development. Advocacy should immediately   follow as I need to communicate research findings to communities to be better informed before disaster happens. In this way, loss  of both human and physical capital will be minimized.<br /></div>
