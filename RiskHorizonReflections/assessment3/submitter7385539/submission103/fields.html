    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1. Thank you for this game, I’ve had few efforts before I have some strategy
achieve a goal. Risk management is a part of the game, because you have some
probability of meteor failing, we can spend money to decries result of burst
with insurance immediately (so I’ve used this instrument  in luck of time), but if you have enough time
the best way is to increase resistibility. It was the best way to provide sustainable
resistibility using time and money you’ve won. So nothing become ruined  and resistibility go to the next level. Trade
of was that better and less expensive normal life to reach high score required
preparations and predictions.  So disaster
 become for you just a surprise after which
everything stay on places, and you’ll continue to achieve you purposes.</span></p>

<p><span>2. Yes people learn how to react 
on some patterns, start to reserve some money. The wellness become a
normal process, give this process own live and try not to think about it a lot,
I was looking only to the indicator, like a clue. Preparation is a force.  Even there was a little bit sophisticated
thinking way or making my own rules.</span></p>

<p><span>3. What we could do for this game, simply apply psychology, and you won’t
see the any responsibility. It could be more interesting with some pregame realistic
pictures and pre-story. If identified people, would take part in this game the
result become a social decision. Motivation must be simple realistic and achievable,
so such simplification gave me constructive way of solving problems with a good
preparation and without crazy rush.</span></p></div>
