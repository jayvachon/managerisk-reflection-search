    <h1>Submission 477 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8140295, session_user_id: a33eaae941f0c747a7e48a81b849669e50223799)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) the role of risk management in the game is to save the pods from damages that were occurred due to the hit of comets. as there were given different choices of insurance that helped a lot to cover the damages. i made a different choices in different level for instance in level 1 i adopted the third option of insurance and in second level i took 50% of insurance.in terms of knowledge , it provide information to assess the exposure to those events and possible outcomes and also help in deciding how to act. it also helped in reducing uncertainties.  as far as protection is concerned, it reduces the size of negative outcomes. in the game there were warning alarm that is when comet came near to hit, it start ringing that alert the player to take those steps through which they would be able to reduce the size of damage. in case of insurance different options were there that helped me to eliminate the possibility of negative shocks. basically insurance in this game provide cushion against the adverse shocks of hitting the comet. 

preparation for risk management  reduces the negative impact of shocks and hazards but also to enable people to pursue new opportunities for growth and prosperity.in other words risk management unleashes the opportunities that is helpful for the growth and development of a economy.thus with the help of knowledge, protection, insurance and coping preparation of risk management lead to development. moreover,  Risk management is also a shared responsibility that requires the active participation of different economic and social systems, as well as the State.

2) i tried this game 4 times in each step i would be able to learn different things like,in first time i did not get the help from insurance choices so in second step i opted for insurance opportunities and came to know that insurance reduces the outcomes of adverse shocks that were the damage due to the hitting of the comet in this game. further i also learnt that preparation of risk unleashes the opportunities in order to move for the next level.

3)Once risks have been identified and assessed,following risk management choices will be adopted in a place where  i live;

a) Avoidance (eliminate, withdraw from or not become involved)
b) Reduction (optimize – mitigate)
c) Sharing (transfer – outsource or insure)
d) Retention (accept and budget

thus It is important to assess risk in regard to natural disasters like floods, earthquakes, and so on. Outcomes of natural disaster risk assessment are valuable when considering future repair costs, business interruption losses and other downtime, effects on the environment, insurance costs, and the proposed costs of reducing the risk.</div>
