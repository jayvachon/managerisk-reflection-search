    <div class="field-value">It was a decent reflection. There is a lot of room for improvement, grammatically speaking. The last paragraph included an example about Central America which was a positive addition to the reflection. However, the reflection was mostly a description of what occurred in the game. I would have liked to see more connection to the themes presented in the readings and presentations. </div>
