    <div class="field-value">This reflection is sequenced well, in terms of the order in which each of the points were put forward. I also like the idea of developing connections in the beginning of the game as to much later. 
Citing a few real life examples to connect to the statements you've made would make it even better. Good Luck! :)</div>
