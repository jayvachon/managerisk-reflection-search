    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that the author clearly describes his/her implemented strategy in the game, and what he/she learnt from implementing it. He/she also reflects well on the game itself. One thing that would have improved the reflection though, is if the author had more explicitly defined and described the dynamics and trade-offs between the four components of risk management (question 1).</div>
