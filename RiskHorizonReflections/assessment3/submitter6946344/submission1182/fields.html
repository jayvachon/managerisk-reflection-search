    <h1>Submission 1182 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6946344, session_user_id: f5db1c38ed16260f571a86d517bed9d382cd3115)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Risk Horizon Game Reflection</strong><br /><br />The role of risk management was to promote or continue development by building resilience and using tools for risk management.  I realized a bit into the game that protection had to be implemented when the threat was not imminent. And to use knowledge and research to prepare for an imminent risk rather than protect at that very time. Also, it’s worth having insurance in advance of a risk, as it gives you some resilience financially and allows you to continue development. Making community connections helped me cope with the aftermath of the shock and took me further into the game.<br /><br />When I played the game again, I protected myself with insurance beforehand and also raised my level of protection to only the required need, as it not only took away my time, but also dropped the bar to red. I still struggled with juggling between protection and development though. I also tried to continue developing as and when resources were available as that was the key to success.<br />I learnt at the end that it is important to balance strategies in risk management to achieve the end goal of development and coping successfully. We must use our knowledge and research to protect ourselves as otherwise it may lead to unnecessary use of resources and also give a false sense of protection. Insurance is an excellent way of shock absorption, as it at least dampens the effect of financial shock through a situation. It also leaves you with some resources to carry on your task. A fine balance and forethought is always needed to manage risk in any situation.<br /><br />I would add a new feature in my version, wherein the tools of risk management would be divided based on individual, community, state and so on. This would give a better idea as to how I could manage risk at a personal level. It would teach me to balance various tools of risk management that an individual has and also utilize help provided by community, etc. It would also teach me how I could contribute to risk management in my community. <br /><br />I would encourage my community to familiarize themselves with tools of risk management like knowledge, protection, coping, etc.. Also, I think it would be very beneficial to first outline the risks faced by my community, for e.g. Earthquakes, so risk management could be specific. <br /><br /><br /></div>
