    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The role of risk management was to anticipate the losses with the purchase of insurance, while researching to see ahead of time how much would be required to protect the village from being destroyed by the asteroids and making gains through upgrades and additional structures. I had to determine early on how many structures I could build that would maximize my gains, while at the same time leaving me enough to fall back on protection and insurance. Researching early provided more opportunities to purchase the right insurance (or none at all) and level of protection. It often garnered a better opportunity for upgrading as well and carrying over extra cash to the next level.</li><li>I played the game a few times, and each time I learned to change a couple of things. I learned really quickly to maximize gains early on that will carry over to the next level. This allowed me to have a cushion to purchase a better insurance policy, better protect my village, or to make timely upgrades that would continue to maximize my returns.Â </li><li>I'd add climate change to better reflect the choices in the place I live. The slightest change in weather determines whether we have severe flooding, or severe drought.</li></ol></div>
