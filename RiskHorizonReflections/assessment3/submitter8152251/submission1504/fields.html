    <h1>Submission 1504 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8152251, session_user_id: e04baf5aa52a86e67b7355d5206d9f075db80c7b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The role of risk management in the game was to develop the community (building pods, enriching them to withstand natural disasters) as well as to save the community from falling comets which had the capacity to destroy the community as a whole. So, risk management involved a combination of prevention of such disasters and coping from the after effects. To save the community, I focused on doing a lot of research on the comets to understand their nature of causing devastation and accordingly took protection measures (alleviating the land to save the pods) and availing insurance as an incentive to re-build the destroyed pods at a cheaper price. The trade offs I faced while playing the game was that even if I did a lot of research on the falling comets to be alert and took protective steps to alleviate the land to save the pods, even then there was destruction. Also, insurance wasn't sufficient to repair the pods, it being expensive (as most of the money I spent on researching the comets, building pods and alleviating land for saving the pods from getting destroyed). Preparation for risk did impact development of the community as focus was shifted to building shock resilient pods which could withstand the natural calamity. Lot of resources were channelized in preventing the effects of the comets by undertaking research, protection and insurance. The resources foregone in preventing loss did slow down development initially but with time, a balance was achieved between minimizing the impact of the external environment (loss caused to the community due to falling comets) and boosting the resilience of the internal environment by building up the upgraded pods. Â <br /><br />2) The main essence of the game was to build up the community keeping in mind the falling comets in the water causing massive destruction to the community. If I were to play the game again, I would invest time and resources to study the comets and accordingly take protection measures to prevent them. Undertaking research would help me to be more prepared for the calamity and would make me take protection to reduce the intensity of it. At the same time, I would keep building and upgrading the pods to make them disaster resilient. Also, before the disaster, I would make community connections to make sure that the disaster's effect is minimal. Also, I would invest resources on insurance to rebuild pods at a cheaper cost incase of any destruction.<br /><br />3) If I were to add something to the game, I would have included the component of "Incentives" as a driver to motivate the community to take necessary steps to avoid/mitigate the effects of such a risk (like migrating to other place or willing to invest in disaster resilient raw materials for building pods). It would have been interesting to see in the game how incentives can change risk appetite of the community influencing their decisions.</div>
