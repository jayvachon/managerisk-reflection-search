    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">After playing the Risk Horizon Game, I realized that loss is inevitable. I played the several times. Each time i became more aware of how important it was not to just focus on one part of Risk Management when decision making. Initially, I thought Insurance was all I needed to secure the future of the community. However, the cost involved due to damage seemed to be poorly spent and was not the best way to mitigate risk. Later I realized that Knowledge (research, probability, impact) and preparation allowed me to make better choices with respect to damage control and repair. Which gave me a better since of the type of insurance was best to protect the community. I found that managing growth while constantly preparing for the next catastrophe was a daunting task. These were many takeoffs that had the be considered while managing risks. For instance, before a catastrophic event, preparation had to be made to make sure necessary elevation was applied, which delayed the repair of already damaged pods, This also slowed growth and development of new pods. Value of pods, cost and insurance and probability of risk, all had to be considered at the same time in order to make the most cost effective decision, while focusing on the heath and growth of the community.<br />What I learn from the game lead me to consider my community, and the areas that are most vulnerable to risk. I live in a coastal area which is vulnerable to hurricanes. Each year we (citizens) are given a report, based on "research", about the probability of a direct hit from a severe storm. This notice is also reviewed by insurance companies, who will determine the rate of insurance you will pay of the upcoming your, or, if your insurance policy will be reinstated at all, For the past five years we (citizens) have been warned of a major storm and each year insurance rates have increased or policies have been cancelled all together. The reason for the increase, insurance companies estimate the repair cost from damage due to hurricane will far exceed the value of the policy. This has caused a major problem for those who have a mortgage that require homeowners insurance. As a result the government has stepped in to provide State Owned Insurance, This insurance is sometimes two or three times the cost of traditional insurance, and with no other options we (citizens) have to pay. Needless to say, there have been Zero storms to hit this region in the past ten years. This game in a way put my situation in perspective. All the wheels of Risk Management must work together in order to be most effective. I believe this process beings with Value. The value placed on belongings. The Value placed on community. The value placed on life.</div>
