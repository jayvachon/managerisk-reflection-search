    <h1>Submission 1938 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2730188, session_user_id: d2374d47c3464e8caa63de7b3dbba00f384e99db)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>The game risk horizon tests different outcomes regarding different approaches at managing risk. The role of risk management in the game was to develop the community, facing the hazardous  asteroids that can ultimately compromise its well being and the ability to grow. </p><p>In order to face the situation there were tools available that allowed for preparation. Research of the asteroids allowed for the creation of community connections before the comet hits this way  acquiring knowledge, long term protection was achievable by raising the position of the island preventing greater damages. The last measure to prepare for the worst was insurence that could be bought to reduce the costs in the event of a rebuilding process.</p><p>After an impact coping would be achieve through the rebuilding of the community depending on the damages, although its amount and the costs associated with the process would differ significantly depending on the preparation measures taken.</p><p>All the preparation would impact the development of the community as it would consume resources in order to prevent greater setbacks. Some mechanisms like insurance would allocate a greater of money right away and the other two (insurance and raising the island level) would consume resources over time. In the end development would not be at its full potential of growth but it would withstand an hit minimizing the impact on the community. Great risk management capabilities can have great impacts in the communities helping distributing the available resources it ways where a perfect balance between prosperity and security is achieved.</p><p>The first time I played I reached a pretty good balance between preparation, growth and coping with the hits reaching immediately the level 4. Although the second time I played I seeked greater preparation which caused immediately a significant decrease in development of the community, compromising the objectives which meant that I would not achieve the goal and therefore I only reached the third level. In the third and last attempt and with the knowledge of the previous games I was able to find the perfect balance between preparation, development and coping reaching level five. This was the major message I learned by playing the game, that sometimes its hard to find the right balance, that development can be easily compromised but if we are not prepared, damages can be great. Risk management is no easy task.</p><p>If I was tasked to develop a new  version of the game I would take its complexity to the next level and add other resources besides only money, for example the human factor. Human resources would need to be manage and distributed through the different activities (more people in one activity, less time it would take) and  upon an asteroid hit they would ultimately also be affected.</p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>
