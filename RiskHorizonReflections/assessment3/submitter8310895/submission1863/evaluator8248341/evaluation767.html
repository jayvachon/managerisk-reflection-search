    <div class="field-value">You express quite well the role of risk management in this game and also i am impressed by the lessons you learned from this game; as to the improvement, i think you might make reflection sounder because now i feel like reading the answer to the three questions more than reading a reflection. A good reflection is not only the reflection to one thing, but also attraction for the people who have no idea to get involved in it, isn't it? In all, it is a very impressive one ! </div>
