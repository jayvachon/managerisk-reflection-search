    <h1>Submission 2448 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4377247, session_user_id: ffc67b34062179383ba5deee1923c2a04af00fca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game captured succinctly the trade offs confronted by risk managers. Resources are finite and must be prioritised for development,  the final objective - the game did bring that out. In fact,  an overly cautious approach adoptedby me in the first go was penalised. However, the game also stressed the impact of balanced and equitable development. Multiple mid tier pods were far likelier to withstand damage than an isolated skyscraper. This and the community links benefit were the main learning for me. On a contrarian note, I did not find safe buildings being incentivised adequately. A building away from the shore should be hurt less by waves- I did not see that happening. 
I felt initially that ,considering the low cost,insurance should not be made available for the entire duration of the level, but later realised that this is exactly how a good public insurance scheme should be. Unfortunately public and micro-insurance  have not really taken off in my country. So don't really have a great perspective.

All in all, had a good time reaching level 4.</div>
