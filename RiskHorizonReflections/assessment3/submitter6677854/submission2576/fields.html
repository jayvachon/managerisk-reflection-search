    <h1>Submission 2576 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6677854, session_user_id: 4ef9464011e065d5ab7cbb344ff703cca770ee8f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to see how the risk of the comet hitting being confronted and it was basically about management between development and protection. The main motive of risk management in this game was to time our development in such a way that we minimize our losses and maximize our investments. The choices I made was reducing my development when I saw comet almost hitting. Research time and again helped in avoiding hits. Also, making a choice of insurance for damage was very crucial indeed. All depended on the timing and on the balance that we maintain in our development and protection. For preparing for risk, at times we had to let go of opportunities like hard core development. If we invested in insurance, we had to wait till we get enough to invest on further development. But investment in insurance was long-term thinking for risk management. So, in short there were a lot of scenarios to the game and approach. <br />         If I played it once, next time when I would play I would have an experience of the hit, the timing of hit, the damage, etc and I would thereby plan my development accordingly. I could also invest in insurance to be safe with extensive damages. For instance, in my first game, I was just doing hard core development, which failed terribly. In the second game, I made insurances and concentrated on research, which helped. What I essentially learnt from the game was how to keep a balance between preparing for risks and taking opportunities and developing coping mechanisms at the same time. If my preparations are too slow, it is difficult to cope, and if they are too fast, then it is difficult to develop. A balance is essential and also timed and correct situational decisions. Certain short-term opportunities or incidents can make one change their long-term plans.<br />       In my opinion,the game is pretty much self-sufficient and gives us a robust understanding of risk management, but if I were given a chance, I would add a timer to indicate the hitting instant of comet. Also, an indication of the area of damage by the comet, would be really helpful for risk management as we can minimize development in those areas from there on.</div>
