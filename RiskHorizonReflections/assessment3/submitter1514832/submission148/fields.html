    <h1>Submission 148 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1514832, session_user_id: 6c1f4ae6225e4b1bb660b2017734fc8c7d185008)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is about how quick to build and continuing need right precaution to strength the infrastructure. Most important of all is to have proper insurance in place. The building of infrastructure provides additional income for further resource available but without proper strengthening and insurance they are open to risk in flood and attack by the comets. To have a right balance, it is important to assess the resource available in the building, strengthening and insurance.  I have only achieved level 1 but fail to protect level 2. This is due to inadequate balance in the resource application.  <br />In the game, the understanding of resources available in the risk management is important. The building of infrastructure without adequate protection and insurance cover open risk for damage. Resource in protection and insurance have been under provided and this results in the loss of the game. On the other hand, the information on the timing of the comet attack and the extent of the damage provide a guideline on the strategy to play the game. <br />To summarize:<br />1. Sustainability of development need to be supported by knowledge of inherent risk (in the game, the comet attacks), protection of the property and insurance. The fast track in building the infrastructure erode resource in risk management and insurance<br />2. After a few trial, the quick and more infrastructure built, the game lost at a lower level.<br />3. The more knowledge on the timing and extent of damage of the comet attack allow more appropriate reaction to the increase of protect and insurance to purchase.<br /><br />Risk Horizon is a simple game but to reach a higher level, it requires proper analysis, strategy and information to formulate the game tactics.</div>
