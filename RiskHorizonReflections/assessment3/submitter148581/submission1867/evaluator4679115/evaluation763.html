    <div class="field-value">Although there were some good strategies employed - focusing more on high severity of comets- the reflection lacks a clear demonstration of the learning materials that assisted in decision making in the game.  It also lacks actions taken to confront damages and 'coping' strategies.  The reflector may not have done the initial research on the game by studying the helpful tips provided.
The answer to the 3rd question missed the point of the game.  The game was designed to strike a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance in "Risk Management" not finance as the player wishes it to be.</div>
