    <h1>Submission 1867 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 148581, session_user_id: 383c737435c855206ced42ba6c843a8585c588be)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game several times before successfully reaching level four, so I'll address questions 1 and 2 together.<br />I do not expect that any single "recipe" can guarantee success in all repetitions of the game, but playing the game several times gave me a better sense of what I needed to focus on at different points in the game. <br />I think initially I was a little too "timid" in starting the development process, but, in fact, at the start the game provides us with a relatively large amount of cash and until a substantial amount of development is done there is really not "much to loose", which means the needs for protection is small, so, in subsequent replays, I became a more aggressive "developer" in the initial stages of the game. As the value of the developed property increased, I also shifted my risk management strategy to a steady, progressive increase in the protection level (to 5-6) as the best "first line of defense", This, together with a reasonable amount of "research", allowed me to "ignore" a good number of less threatening "comets" and optimize the speed of further development. Only when a comet with a potentially very severe (7 or higher) impact appeared did I purchase the highest insurance I could afford. Overall this strategy worked well, allowing me, in the last round I played, to comfortably meet the targets up to level four (I have not yet tried the higher levels).<br /><br />Withe regard to question 3:<br />One thing that was not clear to me in the game were the rules related to the rate of increase/replenishment in "liquidity" (cash) that could be used for further development or risk management. In particular it was not clear to what extent this was this process was "random" and to what  extent the earlier development choices made affected the rate of accumulation and/or replenishment of available cash. From a financial standpoint this is critical, as one needs to match the timeline of expected receivable cash-flows and payments (financial assets and liabilities), allowing for "uncertainty"  (comets). I think clarifying this aspect of the game so that the player can take "financing" explicitly into account would make the game richer. and more realistic. Along similar lines, adding a "credit" option could be interesting: for example the player could be allowed to drown a credit line equivalent to a percentage of available collateral, the "developed property", with some appropriate "rate of interest".</div>
