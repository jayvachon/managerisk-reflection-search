    <h1>Submission 1371 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4812106, session_user_id: 743c5fcae6702847c49323178697e30b47bc8da2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><br /></div><div>The game presents risk management as playing a vital role in the provision of a suitable environment for community growth and development through providing avenues for disaster forecast, impact mitigation and management. It brings to the fore the high level of negative impact that that risk can have on development initiatives and the relevance of risk management initiatives in reducing the severity of the impact arising out of risk in any given situation. The combination of forecasting disasters, insurance against their effects; and protection of the island provided an ideal ground for the growth of the community which growth is eventually also vital for funding further investments aimed at protection and insurance. The game also teaches us the importance of ensuring a balanced approach when implementing risk management measures pointing out that an overreliance on one over the others may not adequately prepare you to face the potential impacts arising out of risk. </div><div><br /></div><div>During the course of gameplay, one major tradeoff was that between researching for further knowledge on the impending disaster and protecting the island from the disasters impacts and from this I learnt that while it’s important to try and understand the potential impact of an upcoming disaster, it was also vital to put in place measures to mitigate the disaster and that often we tend to prioritize one over the other to our detriment. Another important tradeoff was that between protection and wealth creation in which I learnt that measures aimed at protection will draw from the wealth of the nation while at the same time negatively impacting the process of further wealth creation. This in turn meant that the initiatives one would have taken such as insurance and research on the upcoming disaster are put on hold once the focus is turned to protection initiatives.</div><div> </div><div>Multiple times of play taught me the importance of balancing the different aspects of the game as well as the power that social connections have in addressing the impact of disastrous events. After the first few frustrating failures, I learnt to make sure that my research on the upcoming event was better thus providing me with ample time to forge strong community connections in the event of a disaster occurring. I found that even the highest level threats could have their impacts slashed so long as the community connections were vibrant and alive.</div><div><br /></div><div>If I was to be involved in game development, I would incorporate the impact of rapid development on the environment as one of the factors to manage during the gameplay period. This is because in the real world, we have to contend with such issues and it would also force us to explore the wider issues that climate change is bringing such as rising sea levels and changing seasons. These have a wider impact on the ability of communities to recover from disasters especially since food resources which are vital in recovery process are directly impacted.</div><div><br /></div></div>
