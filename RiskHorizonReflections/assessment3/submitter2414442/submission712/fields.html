    <h1>Submission 712 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2414442, session_user_id: e7ece8d9825d0b6c490738ae27cf85734a295dd9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game is to reduce the adverse effects of the shocks (hitting comets) which are flooding and destruction of pods. By doing so, risk management allows for the development of the island which would otherwise always be facing loss.<br />The choices I made in terms of <strong>knowledge</strong>, <strong>protection</strong>, and <strong>insurance</strong> were to balance between growth and preparation for these potential shocks:</p><ul><li>get knowledge (research about comets to reduce the uncertainty in confronting them through decision-making),</li><li>development in building and upgrading of pods, to suscribe to a good policy insurance (to mitigate the blow from hitting comets by transfering financial resources from good to bad times),</li><li>protection (upheaval of the island to lower the probability of the waves and reduce their intensity)</li><li>and coping (reconstruction after the comet hit the island and destroyed the pods).</li></ul>The trade-offs I confronted were the prioritizaton between research, insurance, upgrading of pods and raising of ground and prioritization of research between many falling comets. I had rather make research than raise the island due to power cost; I needed to start with a few pods rather than covering the island and then upgrade them little by little.<br />The preparation for risk affected development immediately in the upgrading of pods and the upheaval of ground (material and financial aspect) and the cost of all preparation (financial aspect). After the comets hit, those preparations proved beneficial, so the effect were seen after some time. <p>If I played the game only once, I would do differently if I were to play it again by starting research on comets immediately after building the first pods.<br />Alternatively, if I played the game more than once, I did differently after the first time in the prioritization of research on comets and insurance before building more pods and upgrading them. The last thing I would do would be to raise the island because it is so power-costly.<br />The main things I learned from the game that it was necessary to <strong><em>plan ahead of time </em></strong>for responses in a <strong><em>systematic and integrative way </em></strong>if one wants to enhance development. It is also necessary to <strong><em>make choices </em></strong>by <em>considering the synergies, the trade-offs and prioritizing the activities</em>.</p><p>The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place I live is to find a way of applying the knowledge gained by research in a concrete manner.</p></div>
