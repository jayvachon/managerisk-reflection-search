    <h1>Submission 357 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5650265, session_user_id: e17a7d837434d63c64f46457919668ceb5b6c3d0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make  and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection,  and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development  (immediately, or after some time)?The role of risk management
in the game was to provide a methodology to identify and analyse financial
impact of loss to the assets on the game (buildings, environment). </div>

<p>I have identifying and analysed
and took steps to reduce the exposure of loss, by transferring the risk to an
insurance company and through research of the potential risks.</p>

<p>The preparation that is
intended specifically to reduce risk has an impact on a sustainable development
as resources are canalized to prevent and mitigate the risk.</p><div>2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you  were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than  once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the  main things you learned from the game?</div><p></p><span></span><p>

</p><p>I would analyse better the
risks in order to create a risk map which could at least provide a better forecast
of the risk, thus allow a better effective preparedness and response to the
risk. As such would also provide better mitigation measures thus a better
sustainable development.</p><div>3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.  Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which  allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you  propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in  the place you live?</div><p>

</p><p>I would propose to set-up a
special account or fund to be used in the event of a loss. </p><p>
