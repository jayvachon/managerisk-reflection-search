    <h1>Submission 297 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 937783, session_user_id: afc11888d54f06dd552817a71dac2956b4bad450)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>There were two scarce
resources in the game: time and money, and there were several alternative
measurements, so the player should make decisions and suffer from trade-offs.
For example, one should make researches but in the same time on cannot increase
protection, and so on. One can be successful in this game if he/she can apply
the risk management framework to this given situation. The player should find a
sustainable and manageable balance between building (give up some money now to
earn more later), prevention (research, increasing protection, insurance) and
cure (repairing). There was a serious problem that made choices and decisions
harder: the time lag between decision and effect, also contaminated with uncertainty.
</p>

<p>In the first round I
tried to apply an old economic golden rule: specialization. I only increased
protection and did not pay attention to research or insurance. This old golden
rule failed: I reached the fourth level but not the fifth. Then I changed my tactic
and tried another one: gain knowledge, then increase protection, and if it is
necessary, get an insurance shortly before the shock. It was successful, I
could finish the game.</p>

<p>If I should change one
thing my choice would be the alteration of uncertainty, I would increase it. I
am of the opinion that the player has too much information about the shocks, I
wouldnâ€™t give (or make it more and faster varying in time) information about
the chance of hit or the severity. </p>
