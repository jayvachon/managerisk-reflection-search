    <div class="field-value">The layout of the analysis is very clear and easy to go step-by-step to follow all the requirements that were met.  Each step was clearly stated and a very relevant and solid recommendation was given at the end related to introducing disease risks, etc.  The only thing to be improved may have been to uniformly format the post and each subset of points, as well as a few typing errors.  Other than that, great analysis!</div>
