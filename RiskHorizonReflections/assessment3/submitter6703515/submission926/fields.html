    <h1>Submission 926 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6703515, session_user_id: 2c92d9be04437cf2229485d28e16783fdc38e0b4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. During the game the role research/knowledge played in the game was of primary importance. As is so often in the world, humans tend to rush in without the correct knowledge of a situation. As the game progressed I learned to be a bit more diligent about the research aspect and to take more time in the research component and then assess the potential impacts, in the game's case, would a meteor strike?<br /><br />I found that insurance plays a key role in risk management; in this case having a provision for repairs after a meteor strike. One also needed to retain funds to allow for the shortfall on insurance cover. Sometimes, development took place too quickly, leaving a shortfall for repairs after insurance paid out. However as time progressed and the requisite knowledge research was acquired, development was maximized to its full potential<br /><br />2. Main thing learned from the game: Conduct the research prior to purchasing insurance. This allowed assessment of potential strike impacts. I didn't particularly enjoy the game as I found it a bit cumbersome and the protection component wouldn't activate.<br /><br />3. One of the biggest risk areas where I live is the risk of Bush Fires. I would like to see a component added to the game that allows you to choice more realistic risks than meteor strikes. For example, flooding, earthquakes, fires, etc.<br /></div>
