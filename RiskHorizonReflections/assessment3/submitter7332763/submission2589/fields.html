    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The role of risk management in the game was to find the right balance among research, protection and insurance. The more prepared (fast knowledge, high protection and right insurance) is the community, faster will be its development.</li><li>If I were to play again, I would research faster expending more time on protection, and I would try to improve in terms of sizing the community and building the right level of insurance in accordance to the degree of the risk or shock coming over. What I learned from the game is how difficult is to balance the three issues confronting risk management.</li><li>I would propose to reflect policy bureaucracy and corruption by adding some kind of widget that would make decisions more expensive (budgeting) and become slower by grading those issues with a percentage level (low, medium or high) over the standard level for developed countries.</li></ol></div>
