    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the parallel the student draws between their personal experience of risk in their community and the concepts articulated by the game.  The point about social interaction was very well described and I felt I learnt something.  The only thing that would make this reflection better would be linking all the answers together into an essay and working more reflection through it in paragraph form.</div>
