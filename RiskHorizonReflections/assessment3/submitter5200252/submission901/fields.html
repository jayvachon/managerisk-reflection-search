    <h1>Submission 901 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5200252, session_user_id: 687b72c8650e7cf1df3040bb43a79d9d017ee2ff)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">For the first two-three attempts I concentrated more on protection and insurance, and I did not take the risk of developing the city. Even though I protected the city from the meteors, and did not take any damage, I still lost. At the beginning, I focused more on protecting, and did not asses the knowledge, therefore I lost.  <br /><br />After a few tries I realized that I should balance my resources between building and developing the already existing constructions, but also I payed more attention to the comets severity and chances of being hit. By doing enough research, and gaining more knowledge,  I was able to prevent the damage the comets  would have caused otherwise. I still purchased the insurance because, even though it doesn't seem that it makes that much of a difference, it helps you rebuild much faster.<br />In my final attempt, I balanced the knowledge I gain from researching the comets, I tried to match the protection level with the chances of being git,  but at the same time, I continued to build and develop my city. <br /><br /></div>
