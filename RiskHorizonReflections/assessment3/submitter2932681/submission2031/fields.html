    <h1>Submission 2031 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2932681, session_user_id: 25822a8ff47bedfbea3479d0f0dcebc5bd722edd)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of
risk management in the game was to evaluate the risk that each of the meteors
brought to the village and prepare in the best way possible for the
consequences.</p>

<p>Regarding
the trade-offs, the important thing in my opinion was to evaluate the risk
posed by the meteors and the capital you had invested in the city. In the
initial phases, I chose not to insure the buildings and try to build enough
protection to deal with the threats posed by the meteors. Even though sometimes
it was not enough, the cost of repairs was small and not worth of insurance. As
the building became more advance it forced me to take a more conservative
approach purchasing more insurance since the damage costs were much larger and
there was many more meteors. Knowledge was used mainly in meteors who posed
bigger treats, with significant probabilities of impact and damage, it was a
cheap tool but a bit time consuming.</p>

<p><span> It was clear that using the resources according
to the risk permitted a better allocation of resources indicating moments where
you should concentrate on dealing with the risk and preparing for immediate
treats and moments where risk was low and effort was concentrated on
development of the village.</span></p>

<p><span>To be
honest it took me a while to understand completely all the aspects from the
game, including its objective. The introduction misses to explain some of the
key features of the game. In the beginning I was very conservative and try to
prepare for the meteors, trying to reduce at all cost its impacts, without
actually putting much though in the trade-offs. I invested heavily on
protection and insurance and did not pay much attention to knowledge. As I kept
failing on the 3rd phase I started to pay more attention on how to
balance my investment and choose the best time to invest in each of the
resources available.</span></p>

<p><span>The thing
that I would change in the game is the way that the resources are used. As I
understood, in the game we were supposed to be responsible for COORDINATING the
actions and not EXECUTING them. Therefore, for that matter, resources should
not be time consuming for the player, like in building protection where you
have to keep pressing on the button for more protection, and knowledge where
you have to keep following the meteor for it to grow. You should be able to
order something and things get done, without direct supervision. Once you chose
to invest knowledge on a meteor it should keep monitoring until it passes the
planet and have a fixed cost per period of monitoring time. I think that would
be a big improvement in the game since it would capture reality best and leave
the player with more time to calculate the trade-offs. </span></p></div>
