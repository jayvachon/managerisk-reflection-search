    <h1>Submission 1653 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5036957, session_user_id: 0f19c9eacb76ca6296a9cba594bd62587b45ca33)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game at least four times in order to reach the maximum level, and every time I learned something new.<br />In the first round after showing the tutorial, I was pretty greedy about development and I had enough luck with the comets until the 3rd level, but then after a comet with a big severity I understood how crucial and important it is, to use the protection.<br /><br />At the second time I tried to strengthen my protection so that no comet would bring damages, but then I failed in achieving the development goals, so I had to restart once again.<br /><br />After that I started to balance between insurance and protection since only protection was too expensive, and I got much more successful, but I still didn't reach the last level because of bad time and development management.<br /><br />In the last time I played, I started to buy the insurance and the protection at strategic times, and not just in the beginning of every level, as I used to do. So with a perfect time management I achieved my development goals, had enough protection for preventing big damages and had always opted for the 50% insurance since it was in my experience, the most cost-effective one.</div>
