    <div class="field-value">I thought this reflection was generally well written and highlighted some of the key learning points of the game. The key strength was the clear attempt to link the game to real life. The main thing to be improved would be to spend a little more time thinking about the structure and wording of the reflection as this was sometimes a little confusing.</div>
