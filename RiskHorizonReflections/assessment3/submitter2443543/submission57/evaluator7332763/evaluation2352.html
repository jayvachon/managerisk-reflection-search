    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the detail on the explanation of the change of his/her settlement strategy if he/she were to play again (Question #2) and the original proposal for the game in question #3. I think that a better explanation of his/hes experience on the game in terms of choices adopted and trade-offs confronted between knowledge, protection and insurance would have made this reflection much better.</div>
