    <h1>Submission 1300 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7147836, session_user_id: a6aaa365d57fe99fd8a5f60d00d0b0e172f8850e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of
risk management in the game was to realize that there is a constant threat
which cannot be prevented completely but which can be mitigated to a certain
extend. In the game the threat could be managed at three different levels:
Knowledge, Protection and Insurance but only a balanced use of the three
methods would lead to sustainable development. With the limited time which was
given I tried to focus increasingly on the building and upgrading of structures
and on the direct Protection by lifting the island up which means that I mostly
neglected the aspects of Insurance and Knowledge in the beginning and focused
on them increasingly once I had at least 5 structures. In the beginning when
one or more prevention measures were applied the development slowed down or
even back-warded but it was the key to success on a later stage when the
meteorites did leave only limited impact or no impact at all! </p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>As I played
the game several times I can say that my strategy was completely different the
first time(when I failed the completion of the levels) and the second time and
third time. The first time I focused mainly on building as many structures as
possible and try to lift up the island as much as possible which had negative
effects as it was setting the development back and therefore I did not manage
to complete the level. The second and third time I used a more balanced
approach  by lifting the island,
especially in the moment just before a disaster and when I was sure that I
still had enough time for 'developing' enough in order to complete the level
successfully.<br />
The most important lesson I learned from the game is that prevention,
mitigation and recovery of and from a disaster are costly and hinder
development and that it is therefore important to use one's resources in the
most efficient way in order to achieve the most sustainable development
possible.</span></p>

<p>Furthermore
I learned that the income generated by structures is higher if the structures
are more developed than if there are many low-developed structures ( Quality
more beneficial than Quantity).</p>

<p>                                         </p>

<p><span>If I would
have to develop a similar game I would add the aspect of Man-made disaster.
Many disasters are created by mother nature but many are created directly by
humans and their actions.<br />
In the countries I have lived the major problems and threats which hindered
sustainable development were man-made. Even natural disasters which are related
to climate change can be associated to humanity's actions as Climate Change has
proven to be partly the consequence of society's impacts on the planet earth.</span></p>

<p><span>Man-made
disasters could for instance be 'riots in society', 'war related poverty', 'air
pollution' and 'water pollution' and prevention and mitigation measures for it
could be 'research', 'mainstreaming' and 'efficient politics'.</span></p></div>
