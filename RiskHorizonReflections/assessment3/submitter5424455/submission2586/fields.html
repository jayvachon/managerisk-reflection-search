    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Reflections from the Risk Horizon game:<br />The role of risk management in the game was to learn how prepare against negative shocks.Some of the trade offs i had to face was giving up a high insurance coverage in exchange for more protection and more resources to build new pods,or having to build less pods in order to to be able  to afford their insurances when they evolved since they became more expensive.These trade offs led me to make some choices which had to with reaching a balance between the deployment of knowledge,insurance and protection,thus making sure these elements were available every time  and that they did not turn into obstacles.I learned from the game that a good way of managing risk is by identifying the resources you have and how they may help reduce risks.<br /></div>
