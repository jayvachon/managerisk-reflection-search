    <h1>Submission 2120 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7424499, session_user_id: 219999c805a797035a8262d3299675e2d100dbf9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game the role of risk management was fundamental, because if you don't make a good management of the risk the game can not continue and the city can't develop and suffer the consequences of a risk. In the game you see the importance of the research, the knowledge, protection and insurance. And how you have to make a balance between this actions to pass to the next level and continue with the development of the city.

In the game you can notice the importance of preparation for risks, if not the city suffer a decline in the development. That makes more difficult to pay attention to future risks because they'll be focused repairing the results of shock that the city suffered.

I play the game many times. I made it to level 3 after several attempts. The first few times I paid attention to one or two actions. for example paying attention to insurance and protection and neglecting the information search and the development of the city. I realized that when searching for a balance and gave equal weight to each of the actions is better when driving risks.

With this game you can realize that risk management has several elements, each can not work in isolation. .</div>
