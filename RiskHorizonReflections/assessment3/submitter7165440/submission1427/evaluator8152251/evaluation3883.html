    <div class="field-value">He/She has been able to clearly explain risk management technique to be deployed when a natural calamity occurs. While he/she has been able to identify the balance between risk management techniques, there was innovation missing in the reflection. The point of "loan" was proposed. I think this would have made the game more complicated as now you would have to think twice before applying for a loan for re-building pods as interest would be charged against it. A community where there are natural calamities and every now and then the community is in a fear of a falling comet and flooding, this is evident that money will be needed to repair them. Insurance is the best way to motivate and fund such communities having a constant fear of natural disasters to re-build the pods. People cannot be applying for loans every now and then the moment a calamity occurs. This would push them to deep financial crisis and development of the community will be majorly hampered.  

Instead, he/she could have focused on proposing factors of "incentives, behaviour and resources" to be embedded in the game (factors affecting your decisions regarding risk management, with the factor of information already been covered in the game) when added to the game alters your risk management strategy of knowledge, protection and insurance. This would have been interesting to notice in the game with all the factors coming in that can affect your risk management techniques.</div>
