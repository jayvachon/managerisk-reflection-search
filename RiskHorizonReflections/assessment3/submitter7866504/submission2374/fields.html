    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game was an incredibly effective tool for understanding the complexity of risk management as applied risk management was the only mechanism for advancement throughout the game. The three key elements of risk management namely knowledge, protection and insurance formed the basis of any strategic decision making. It clearly demonstrated the difficulty of maintaining a balance between the three elements and on top of that the pressure of the need for further development. Seizing opportunities of cheap upgrades to the development was not always possible as more often than not, due to a lack of resources, development had to halt for the benefit of the highest possible insurance. So in return, once sufficiently insured one was almost lacking behind in development, played the other way around though meant  gaining a state-of-the-art development which was falling prey to the next shock and too expensive to rebuild without insurance. That said, even with insurance, if not enough importance had been placed on gaining knowledge, there was not enough time to tighten community structures in order to successfully rebuild the development. In other words, the aspect of coping after a shock played a vital role alongside knowledge gaining, protection building and securing insurance as well. I played the game a couple of times. At the beginning I focused on building as many different units as possible. This strategy worked fine in the first two levels but it became clear soon after that upgrades are desperately needed before they grew too expensive to shoulder. From then on I focused on a few units but upgraded them as soon as possible. Constant high insurance was another priority and making sure there were always enough resources to finance new insurance when needed (at the beginning of each new level) often meant not being able to develop further. The main thing I have learned is that although you might mean well, focusing on only one aspect of development has fatal effects. I you see each level as a term in office of a government you can understand how they would like to focus on building as much as they can as that is what is visible to the population, leaving future governments to invest in knowledge and insurance. Being short sighted is tempting but a balanced combination of gaining knowledge (of the nature of risks involved as well as its possible effects), protection (upgraded development structures, strong communities) and sufficient insurance is essential.
As I live in Europe, the resent developments in the Eurozone suggest that we are at a high risk of overspending. So if I could change one simple thing in the game, I would let contenders apply for credit that has to be paid back with interest at certain times. That way the temptation of building more than own resources permit is raised and the difficulty of letting “later generations” deal with repercussions of overspending is added to the resilience of the developments.
