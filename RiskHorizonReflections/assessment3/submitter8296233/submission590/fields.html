    <div class="field-value"> THE RISK MANGEMENT *DEVELOPMENT, PROTECTION  AND KNOWLEDGE

The role that develops risk management in the game is the fundamental objective as it altogether or protection through knowledge and insurance are can avert a disaster can prevent it or at least minimize the consequences of the same. 

 From the point of knowledge is an area of great importance that will prevent the risks in a high percentage and we will let see the fields of interference of the possible risks.  In the area of protection based on the knowledge it generates all the means and actions aimed at the protection of the general environment of the area may be affected.  

With respect to insurance teaches us that they must be taken into account as a fundamental basis to be able to generate sufficient resources for power so take restorative measures of damages possible dice by involvement of the risk already accomplished.

In my opinion I think that preparation for the risks impacting occurs immediately and after.  

Regarding the game first determined in my second operation is that development in an area with great influences of risk should be slowly but surely, not to build throughout the city that that generates greater vulnerabilities, constantly about the threat research is of great importance; 

what I learned from the game is that the topics of development, protection, and knowledge should interact permanently with a peer development and importance.

In my opinion and in the development of my area it would take into account activities such as earthquakes, tremors or development natural situations such as eruption of volcanoes, lahars and floods according to the geography of my country.  

While eta is a culture that for 10 years really has been implemented in the country and that the State as responsible only for generating policies public and State in this respect has strengthened all programs and organizations such as structures at all levels from the local to the national.   

Therefore the educational and academic activities as previously performed are elements of practice in the decision-making process at the threat risk gives us a playful way of planning and execution channels these possible situations.  


When the management of the risk of a logical and concatenated form variables presenting the same game as the development, protection, insurance and research see how in a comprehensive manner, we can develop strategies to face the risk that can affect us.
