    <h1>Submission 1651 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8178930, session_user_id: 32dae87486b7bf5ae7091a836fa1d129d47d73bb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game was the exact replica of the title of this MOOC –
‘Risk and Opportunity: Managing Risk for Development’, where ‘risk’ was those
falling comets whereas money, insurance and protection constituted the term ‘opportunity’.
Apart from these constituents, ‘time’ also played a crucial role because it’s also
necessary to take appropriate action at the right time because all the actions
in the risk management go in vain if they are not initiated at the time
required <i>(and time management was
necessary too to win the game actually)</i>. 
Honestly speaking, I was unable to clear the game at the first attempt
and I took four. </p>

<p>Risk management plays a very crucial role in the path of
development and no development process is complete without confronting risk. Risk
can never be reduced but it is actually transferred, for example, risk of loss
due to natural calamity can be transferred to insurance company by taking an
insurance policy but it cannot be reduced. </p>

<p>The game pushes to think strategically and pick right
choices at the right time from the limited options available.  It was necessary to keep co-ordination among
research, protection and insurance so that development process can move on its
regular pace. Knowledge was the base to take any of the decisions regarding
insurance and protection. When the severity was high of the comet, I went for
high protection and when severity was not so high, I focused on taking
development initiatives. I always preferred buying the best insurance plans so
that maximum compensation can be recovered against the losses. </p>

<p>I played the game more than once. During the first attempt,
I relied only on insurance cover but I learnt that being proactive is far more
important than purchasing cover because insurance compensates for the losses
while protective measures help in reducing the damages. One lesson I felt very interesting
is that adopting protective measures never go in vain; they will always pay you
back when needed.</p>

<p>The tool I would like to add in this game is for better
decision making capability. Some research work should be done on how many
people actually want to participate in the protective measures so that government
can consider other alternatives and it’s very essential to get feedback of all
the measures previously taken.</p>

<p>In the end, all I would like to say is that it was such a
great learning experience and it will definitely help me applying these principles
in the real world. </p></div>
