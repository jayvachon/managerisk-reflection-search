    <div class="field-value">It was interesting to read about the description of the  role and the nature or 'risk' and the idea that this cannot be avoided or reduced but transferred. I liked the fact that knowledge plays an fundamental paper on every risk and development strategy and it was clearly explained how it is necessary to succeed. Maybe I would like to read a bit deeper reflection about research, a topic that is always difficult to prioritise during an emergency. 

I think the reflection is complete and clear and the statement well developed. </div>
