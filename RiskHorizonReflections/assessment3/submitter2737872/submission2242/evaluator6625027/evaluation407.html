    <div class="field-value">The key strengthen is that the authorâ€™s reflection is that they related the game to reality and the affects that spending on risk management may leave vulnerability by over committing funds and not having resources left for bank reserves and education. In addition to discussing research, protection, and insurance. It was also interesting to present the game improvement of allowing for multi users to share/pool resources.

The assignment showed evidence of reflection on the game and learning, rather than simply describing what happened in the game. I do not have comments to improve the submission. If I had to add a point for reflection, it would be to discuss further with the author about their views on risk for opportunities.
