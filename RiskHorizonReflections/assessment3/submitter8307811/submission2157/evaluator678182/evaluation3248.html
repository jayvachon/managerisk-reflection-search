    <div class="field-value">This candidate had a fair understanding of both the game and knowledge of the course materials, but they struggled with presenting the two in a clear and concise manner. A great deal of time was spent describing the game process almost throughout the essay and the absence of paragraphs made it even more difficult to sense when the author was moving from one part of the question to the others. Whereas the use of paragraphs might have been more helpful in structuring the essay. Even the recommendations posed some confusion. While it was clearly outlined, one is doubtful whether it was feasible within the context of the game. The suggestion was for the inclusion of the role of self-help groups, whereas the game itself was about individual judgement on the use of information, protection, insurance and resources.</div>
