    <div class="field-value">You addressed the questions quite clearly and with simple examples. Your descriptions are accurate and the general composition is fluent. 

On the other hand, your reflection on the importance of the elements that build up the game is not as strong as it could be. While you describe quite well the action-reaction cycle (mostly for the first question), you provide little explanation for your actions (both for the second and third questions). Moreover, the activity required a 400 to 600 words essay. Your composition has little over 300 even when you added the questions to your writing! The total sum of words from your answers is 195 words (more or less). I think taht you should have focused your writing on providing answers and reflection on the lessons learned.</div>
