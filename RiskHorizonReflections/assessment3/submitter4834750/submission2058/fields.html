    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>This game
has a lot of similitudes with real life. I did the game a few times, and in each
one I was realizing the importance of planning and have to have protection. My
initial reaction was to build refuges, but then I realized that what I needed
first was insurance, because the losses could be so big without it that at
least a basic insurance coverage was worth it. In real life people tend to act
first (build refuges) rather than think what is the best strategy and we waste
so many resources doing the wrong things. I also realize that the game focuses
on the importance of savings. If I had savings from one level to the next, I
could buy a bigger insurance right away, and then I could focus on building or
upgrading the refuges and in building knowledge. As in real life, the better prepared
I was from the beginning the better outcome.  The other similitude is the absolute lack of
time to make up your mind and do something. You have to choose among your
alternatives in a quick way and this rush sometimes led me to mistakes. With experience
I learned which choices to pick first and how to build a better money cushion
for the future. In the game as in real life you have to chose quickly and your
past actions have an important effect on your future. Other similitude with
real life is that once I had suffered a major impact, I was more willing to do
certain things first and I realized that having a larger insurance was the best
possible strategy, given the size and frequent meteor impacts. </span></p><p>One thing I would change in the game is the way collaboration is addressed. My understanding was that you could build/strengthen your relations just when a meteor hit and there was almost no time to do it. I think real life is different, you build relations constantly and have more time for that than just when there is a catastrophic event.</p></div>
