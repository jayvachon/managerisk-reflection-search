    <div class="field-value">I liked that you focused mostly on the real life applicability of the game, rather than on the game itself. It shows that you put substantial thought into how the game represents the theory learned in this course. 
The adjustment you suggest to the game does not resonate well with me. I feel like the reasons why you did not get past a certain level were fairly clear and with a little more reflection, could have been understood. 
Overall I liked your reflection and I think it was good at answering the questions included in the exercise.</div>
