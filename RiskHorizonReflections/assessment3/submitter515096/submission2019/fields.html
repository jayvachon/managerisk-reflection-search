    <h1>Submission 2019 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 515096, session_user_id: bb33b4b5363b4d4fe291955a1864acf5418970ec)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game was a nice, simple, insightful game about risk
management. With the relatively few variables, it was easy to take on, but
drove the important risk management points home. Risk management is critical to
the success of the town. Without it the town would be destroyed and unable to
be rebuilt. </p>

<p>I found it most valuable to maximize research, I had the
best outcomes recovering when I researched before a comet hit. As the game
progressed, the protection became too difficult to maintain since progress to
passing the level would stop. At the same time, there was a required financial investment
which was easier to make as the game progressed than the time investment. This
drives home an interesting point that there is an optimal balance in risk
management between physical protection and other forms of community
preparedness. As for the insurance, I found that it made me feel better, but it
didnâ€™t appear to have the same benefit as other forms of preparation.
Preparation was critical to the success of the development (or advancing
levels). </p>

<p>If I were to play again, I would develop my settlement
faster and spend less money on physical protection. I just missed making it to
the 6th level. Also, I would continue to research heavily and buy 33%
or 50% insurance.</p>

<p>The main thing I learned from the game is how choices in
resource allocation are critical to maintain the resilience of the town. There
is clearly a benefit/cost to each action and while the game was relatively
simple, it is easy to see how the complexities of the real world could make disaster
preparation, recovery and mitigation are difficult. </p>

<p>One thing I would change in a new version of the game is the
weighting and visible benefit that insurance provides. To make the game more
representative of where I live, I would make tornadoes the natural disaster. </p>
