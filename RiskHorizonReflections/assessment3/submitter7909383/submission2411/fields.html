    <h1>Submission 2411 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7909383, session_user_id: d8429c8ae6b05de2ddecca00d84e262d1ecd9b99)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>The role of risk management in the game was to increase the community's resilience against the attack of the comets , in order to help the community to keep developing and recover as fast as possible from set backs. I was always trying to prepare my community with the minimum cost ( the severity of the comet identifies how much protection should I be providing to order to get the minimum damage or no damages, because I need the rest of the money to keep developing my community, therefore I didn't spend more than the needed amount to protect the community). I made sure to obtain knowledge about the comets through looking after them, provide the needed protection (not less in order not to damage the community &amp; not more in order to use the rest of the money in development), &amp; I made sure to buy insurance because in case that a comet damaged the community, the community will be able to recover as fast as possible with the least cost. I have learned that when the community is well prepared, no damages happens, you will be to spend the money on development instead of repairs and recovery, so if the community is well prepared, they will be able to keep developing, Also I have learned that communities should spend more money on preparations instead of spend the money on recovering from the shocks. the cost of preparation was immediate but the benefit came later.</li><li>I played the game more than once, what I have done differently was that I did not over protect the community, so I can use the rest of the money in development, also I tried to spend as much time as I could in looking after the comets, in order to gain as mush knowledge as possible about the comets, Also I did not procrastinate in preparing and developing the community. I have learned the community needs to be well prepared in order not to suffer big damages and long time of recovery.</li><li>I would like to change the scenario in order to target individuals, in order to help them dealing with daily risks and prepare for them well, for example I would make the scenario as a family of 4 (parents and two kids) they face lots of risks, such as illness, unstable economy, then they have to prepare themselves for these risks, for example in order to avoid being ill they have to buy organic food, provide good sanitation. </li></ol></div>
