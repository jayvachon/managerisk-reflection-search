    <h1>Submission 948 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8279327, session_user_id: 53a3da32dce13a3c8d358ef1944cd7afda877907)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of the game in risk management is that we always
face risk in everyday living and how we manage to confront all those risk and
plan how to control and prevent the risk that may affect our lifestyle.  In knowledge, if we are able to know what are
the possibilities if we are able to know the resources or the needs of the
community. We must understand the message or what meaning conveys of every part
in the community that may help. In protection, there are lots of possibilities
facing a risk and we should have knowledge to protect ourselves or our country
and community. If we are knowledgeable about the protection we know how to
protect ourselves in the risk that we will face in near future. In insurance,
we should allot money even we think that it’s highly cost but after all we will
benefit at the end. This may help us to save and use when we are facing problem
that may affect the development. When we are insured we will know to pay the
damages that risk caused. We should immediate address the needs or sometimes we
should take ahead of time. Sometimes we need to plan ahead for us so it may not
affect the development even though there’s a lot of risk<br /><br /><p>2. I learned that risk is always been there and we are always facing
a lot of risk in just a moment we need to take advance prevention so the
damaged will not be bigger. Thinking what will be the most effective way to
solve or what will be the resources we have. As I explore the game and knowing
what should be the best way, there’s always a strategy plan ahead of time or should
prevent even before it will happen. In what I did I think what will I can do to
prevent bigger damages by allotting money in insurance and upgrading those pod
even though it is costly but this will help to be develop the community.  I think the main things I really learned is
that having a knowledge regarding that risk we face, that there will always be a protection
to assist and the insurance that I think have a bigger help if the damages
occur. </p>

3. If I have a chance to change anything from the game, I think
I should change the animations or the cartoons it way. I change them into
houses in a community and a crisis will be the disasters, for us to know the
reality. We are able to relate if we see something the same in our community or
somewhat we think they have similarities.</div>
