    <div class="field-value">The learning process throughout the game reflected a very natural learning process in terms of risk management, eventually all aspects of the game were adequatelly taken into account. The major take away of the game were considered, and there was a very good understanding of the challanges that are faced and the alternatives available, as well as the efforts that have to be taken, in order to implement a proper risk management strategy. 
One thing that it is not clear is whether the concept of insurance was properly grasped. In real life is usually dificult to grasp the importance of insurance since it is hard to see the cost/benefit ratio, given the fact that benefits might be perceived very far away in the future. Nevetheless, insurance is important because risk management is a continuos learning process and we can't fall in the trap of believing that even after extensive research and experience we finally know all possible events, there are always a component of unexpected events for which we are inevitably not prepare to face with the tools we have at our disposal, excpect for insurance. The ultimate goal of insurance being not only providing coverage under negative impacts from a known potential event, but especially providing means to help us cope with unexpected events. </div>
