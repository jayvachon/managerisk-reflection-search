    <h1>Submission 1198 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3370727, session_user_id: 4ee7cc73381f0407e4cfbc8bcfc5049f2578c179)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.The role of
risk management in the game aimed to help the game player to think, plan and
deal with different aspects of risk management issues via the risk-management
decision making experiment in the game. It helped to train users to think,
understand and experience how the application of risk management skill would
help to protect the community building in the game. It also helped users to
apply their risk management strategies against the changing environments. That
is to say, the whole game is designed to help users understand how and why risk management is vital for healthy (i.e.
sustainable) development.
Under limited resources, decision makers need to be rational and realistic when
making risk management decision. Only when the community has built with a solid
foundation, then it can continue to develop. Hence, whether to start building
different projects at the same time, or building one with having appropriate
protection before starting the other, becomes to the key to have a healthy
development in the game. </p><p>2.
Practices
make perfect. The main difference between playing the game once and more than
once would be the risk management planning process. I started to understand the
meaning of planning and protection as it’s not a short-term community building
in the game. Once the user understands the rule of the game i.e. healthy
development, then the concentration of the user should be more related to the
risk management and planning as well as the availability of financial resources.
How to better use the limited financial resources, and how to better enhance
the foundation &amp; protection of the buildings will become very important during
the process of risk management planning in order to win the game i.e.
establishing a sustainable community. Under the time constraint / uncertainty,
I needed to ensure the protection of the existing buildings, before starting
building new ones. What inspires me in this game is rational thinking. Much of
what I did in the game involves a process—a series of actionable, repeatable
steps that can be performed to accomplish a desired objective. 

</p><p>Besides, as
explained by Kyla Wethli, it had two major sets of choices I had to make when
playing the game:</p><p>Firstly, how
much of my financial resources to allocate on development by building and
upgrading pods? These pods would generate growth that contributes to
the speed of the development meter in the game. Secondly, how
much of my financial resources (and time) to spend on preparation for risk by
purchasing insurance, protecting my pods by increasing the level of my
community, or researching the probability and severity of comets coming towards
the community across the horizon. These choices involve opportunity cost. </p><p>

</p><p>

3.The role of
government is needed, as the government would have more resources in term of providing
the risk information and providing assistances to people regarding to the risk,
educating people how to prepare for the risk, and regulating the behaviour
of people i.e. regulating certain risk management strategies be taken via rules
&amp; orders.</p><p>

<span>With a capable
and efficient government leadership, it would drive the individuals and the
business into the right direction in term of risk management at national level.
The government would also establish necessary procedures, guidelines and
regulations to help individuals and businesses to more efficiently allocate
limited resources to minimise the negative implications of uncertainties.  It should be the government that determines
the rules of the game as to how to monitor, motivate and manage various
stakeholders’ behaviours including individuals and businesses by implementing
effective and appropriate risk management incentive schemes so as to achieve a
sustainable community development model.</span></p><p>
