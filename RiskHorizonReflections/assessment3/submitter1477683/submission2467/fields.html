    <h1>Submission 2467 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1477683, session_user_id: c007c89d8adbce5ae0161a1f37d6128cd89e73e7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>What was the role of risk management in the game? What
choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of
knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk
affect development?</b></p>

<p> Risk Management had
an extremely important role in the game. While on one hand, the objective was
to maximize the growth and development (of the pods), on the other, it was about
ensuring that the risks (damage caused by comets) be minimized, efficiently. Thus
the role of knowledge (research), protection, and insurance was critical. The
choices that I made related to using knowledge (research on comets) to
determine how I should spend funds on protection and how much should be covered
using insurance. Since all three options costs money, the core trade-offs had
to be made on the amount that I can spend on buying research, insurance and
protection while at the same time ensuring development. Preparation for risk
was directly related to the development; the better prepared we were, the rate
of development, either in the short or long run, was also higher.</p>

<p> <b>If you played the game only once, what would you do
differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game
more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the
main things you learned from the game?</b></p>

<p> When the first time
I played the game, I went ahead and immediately bought the most expensive
insurance to protect the planet against the destruction caused by comets. Later
on I realized that I could do better by first examining the severity and probability
of the impact and the level of development that I have (high level pods costs
more to repair) and then deciding on the amount of funds to be spent on buying
insurance. Therefore the main things that I learned from the game were:</p>

<p> 1.    
The role
of research is very important in decision making (about investing either in development or buying or ensuring protection) and the knowledge about disasters play a very
crucial role in managing them</p>

<p><span>2.    
</span>Any
expenditure on infrastructure development has to be backed by protection
measures and insurance. However, the decision on how much to spend depends on the
level of knowledge that we have about the disasters: the higher the knowledge,
better would be the utilization of funds</p>

<p><span>3.    
</span>If
disasters are managed properly, the rate of development is also higher;
however, the highly developed infrastructure requires high level of risk
management and protection.</p>

<p><b>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of
risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the
game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you
propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the
place you live?</b></p>

<p>The country, in
which I have lived, has a very high level of corruption. This corruption not
only undermines the development process, it also inhibits ensuring protection against
natural disasters or other types of shocks. Thus, if I were to develop a new
version of the game, I would include a mechanism for capturing this aspect. One
way of doing this may be by using a corruption meter which changes according to
the right or wrong decisions that we make in the game. For example, if we buy
costly insurance for a disaster with low severity level and low probability of
impact, then this may reflect high corruption and the player may be penalized
in some way, probably by lowering the development to a certain level.</p>
