    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Risk Horizon Game </b></p>

<p>The
role of risk management in this game is to find a good balance between the
building a community through affordable and optimal risk preparation. I was
able to reach the fourth level by sequencing my activities; (i) building the
communities, (ii) gaining knowledge about the comets, (iii) using the gathered
money to take an insurance, (iv) safe money for repairs, (v) use the remaining
time to heighten the community protection level. My main trade-off was between
buying an insurance vs. gathering knowledge on the comet risk. That is, if a
comet expected severity and impact was low I delayed the buying of insurance
and invested in building the community. Gaining knowledge about the comet,
choosing for the appropriate insurance level and heightening the community
protections resulted in less community building activities.   </p>



<p>I’ve
played the game 6 times in the conviction I would be able to get to level 4 and
gain the 10% bonus. While getting increasingly frustrated about the time lost,
I adjusted my risk management strategy by becoming more risk-taking and  delaying and moderating the insurance level.  I also stopped repairing in the last minute
observing that these will not be finished, and used the last 30 seconds to
heighten the community protection level. I learned that priorities have to be
set between gaining knowledge, protection and insurance. As a rule of the thumb
I limited my “Comet Research” till the expected severity level, and included
the time factor in decisions on construction and repair activities  </p>

<p> </p>

<p>The
game has succeeded and capturing the main elements of influence of
risk-management; risk knowledge, insurance and protection. If possible I would
like to add an option allowing to personalize the game through the profiling
players cultural and/or individual character traits; e.g. level of risk-taking,
type of education, country. Doing so, would allow the player to tailor and
experience the influence/effect. This addition would further increase the game
realism by balancing economic/rational decision making with personal, social
and cultural factors.   </p>
