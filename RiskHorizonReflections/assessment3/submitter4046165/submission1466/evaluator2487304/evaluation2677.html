    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is clarity and understanding of the nature of the game. The student who wrote this reflection described what he/she learned from the game and what is the role of the risk management in the game.
This reflection would be better if the student would describe knowledge, protection and insurance more thoroughly even though one could understand the nature of these concepts while reading the reflection. The description of the coping would make this reflection better.</div>
