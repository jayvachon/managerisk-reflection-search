</p><pre> </pre><ul><li>The role of risk management was
     critical in leading my decisions. It allowed me to make my choices and
     decisions on the level of severity, the chance of the event to happen and
     research to minimize uncertainty. In addition, I relied on available
     resources and incentives or rewards. In fact, knowledge or information,
     insurance and protection have also my considerations for preparation.
     Preparation for risk affects development due to the fact that it uses
     resources upfront for knowledge, protection and insurance therefore
     diversion of some development resources for such preparation or interventions.
     However, it benefits development as it helps to avoid or minimize the
     adverse impact of the risk that may regress back the hard won development
     and investments, social, economic and political advancements. On top of
     that, the resource needed upfront for preparation as well as after the
     event for relief, recovery and reconstruction is small if preparation is done
     as risk management. In fact, assets, human capital, social cohesion, life
     saved or protected. In addition, development path will not be
     significantly affected by the event and my nation will be of its track
     within a short period of recovery. In addition, in my role as a decision maker,
     I learned the importance of integrated tools and coordinated intervention
     of risk management institutions. This means, one toll or institution along
     is no sufficient to ensure effective risk management. This prevents fragmented
     and short sighted intervention and promotes harmonized and aligned intervention
     of risk management.</li>
 <li>I would like to optimize the
     balance between development and risk management investment (preparation as
     well as coping). I mean, I allocate resource in a way that it will be optimally
     used to maintain the development effort and invest on risk management to
     protect such development and exploit opportunities to be emerged from such
     risk management.</li>
 <li>Well, I would propose a sort of
     indictor that represents availability of stable institutions that
     responsible in dealing with effective risk management. It is well pronounced
     in the course materials that one of the failures of effective risk
     management is the absence of committed and stable institutions that apply
     such risk management tools. If such institutions are in place, averting or
     minimizing the adverse impact of the obstacles (misaligned incentives, Lack
     of information for decision, unaccepted behavior, resource limitation)to
     risk management possible when we say responsible, it means ethical and professional
     in applying the reels and regulations. Otherwise, the financial crisis
     that some times said to be emanated from unethical practices of management
     and staff is damaging and even aggravates or contributes or become a cause
     for risk and crisis promotion.</li>
