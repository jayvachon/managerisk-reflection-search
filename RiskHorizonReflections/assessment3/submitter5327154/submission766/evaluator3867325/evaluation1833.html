    <div class="field-value">I believe that the three different tools have greatly varying utility at different stages within the levels as well as different levels. I am not certain that the reflection clearly articulates the value of understanding the VALUE of THREAT (The intensity of damage, not the probability or severity of damage). The strategy should be based on the funds findings (research), stage of development (How huge or small the DAMAGE will be), the availability of funds and time. Also, getting protection early on helps since it carries over from one stage to the next.</div>
