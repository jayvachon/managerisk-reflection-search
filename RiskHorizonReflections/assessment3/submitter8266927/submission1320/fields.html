    <h1>Submission 1320 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8266927, session_user_id: 6557eb6cb0ac94f2f120dbd448cbe02b6a940630)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game was to prevent the crash of the comets upgrading the level of protection of the pods watching before the level of risk to anticipate damages. We see that insurance play an important role helping to reduce the cost of repairs. When a comet was coming I chose to wait to have more wealth in case of crash. So I must wait for the plots to be upgraded. <br />Insurance have been a good help for the last levels, when the comets where faster and stronger and the rhythm was even more intense. Insurance was helping me to react quickly in case of a huge crash of a comet - the point is to save wealth in case of a cataclysm. <br />Preparation for risk affects upgrades in a big way : I couldn't upgrade everything because I needed to save some money in order to anticipate an eventual crash. It was an immediate impact for risk whereas after some levels, this had a huge consequence. Underdeveloped infrastructures because of previous anticipations (of a comet crash) made the game to be harder and harder. Nevertheless, by anticipating these underdeveloped plots, it was more easy to set up goals and aims in order to upgrade everything and just to upgrade (N+2) just a part of the plots to make them more productive. <br />After the first time (I played the game twice), my reactions were quicker and I exactly knew what do to at each different levels. Each crash, each upgrade, each new building plot, each insurance... I knew what to buy after saving an exact amount of money, how to insure it (how many percent of savings) and I knew how to anticipate the number of comets crashing to my land.  I learned not to redo my previous mistakes, especially by spending too much money on upgrades or insurances (high insurances are even more expensive when the upgrades are high so I needed to find a good level between insurance and upgrade in order to protect my plots). Moreover, it was a good example of how not to mismanaged risks in an emergency situation. Not anticipating the comet crashes or any risks related to the plots was even more expensive than trying to prevent them with protections, insurances or anticipations. Anticipating is more like a coping mechanism, it is to say that if you want to save some money, you need to anticipate and prevent risks by spending money. Even though it is expensive or not that useful at the moment M (because the risks seem far away, or gone forever), you will save much more money and save a huge amount of lives and infrastructures if you spend that amount at this time instead of spending it at M+1. <br />If I could add one part of the game, I would love to insert a sort of police and security staff to be hired in case of a crash. If a trouble occurs, we are just repairing things without taking care of the social aspect of it. Nevertheless, we saw that when a disaster happens wherever on Earth that the social aspect is almost as much important as the natural one. People lose mind, go crazy and sometimes you need a sort of insurance to anticipate a bad reaction related to a disaster. <br />So I guess that to include this social aspect into the game must have been a good option which covers a wide range of events and reactions, making the game more complicated but covering a much more realistic aspect of what risk management is. </div>
