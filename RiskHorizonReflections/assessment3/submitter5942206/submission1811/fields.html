    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management game brought to light the trade-offs between risk and opportunity.  There were financial implications to every attempt to develop a plot. Purchasing Protection, Insurance, or knowledge had their own financial commitments which also had implications on how much I could develop on the plots. However, the insurance I purchased reduced how much I needed to rebuild destroyed pots.

The second and third time I played the game. I took more advantage of the insurance which ensured that I spent less on rebuilding destroyed pots </div>
