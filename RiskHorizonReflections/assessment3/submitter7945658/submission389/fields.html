    <h1>Submission 389 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7945658, session_user_id: 75ff5feeb18315b96b82da9fe8a0aee72f06a19f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Risk is inevitable in every society, and based on the scenario described in the risk game, Risk management played the role of helping an individual, society, organization, government get the best out of the event by gathering data (Knowledge) based on fact, statistics, research, past occurrence to build a mechanism for protection against imminent risk to reduce or minimize effect of risk (Protection), then get a very good come-back plan that will help recover fast from damages caused by risk after all measures have being put in place (Insurance).<br /><br />2. Tried as much as possible to notice the pattern of strikes and trend of the game, then tried to build and upgrade structures as much as possible before first strike, build a strong protection based on information gotten from research on each meteor, then get the best insurance plan for relatively cheap and quick recovery after strike if any damages was caused at all.<br /><br />3. Would propose the addition of text to each icon on the game menu to increase level of user friendliness of the game, then also add task expected for user at each stage of the game.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
