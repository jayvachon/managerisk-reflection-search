    <h1>Submission 181 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7553682, session_user_id: 812cea0e9fcd20f8708b553e946fbbe560950452)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>         The role
of risk management was to protect the world of Alora against the potential
threats from meteor strikes and help the community to go through these threats
by confronting them. Protection of the Alora world from systemic risk and related losses was the
main goal of the game. Starting this game of risk management I had to invest most
of my resources to research and protection. Keeping research in a steady pace
and having the proper protection helped significantly moving from the one level
to the next. Research helped to keep development solid and with a firm forward stepping.
Also research assisted in taking the appropriate insurance measures when needed,
the right moment and not spend resources without a reason. Insurance is a
standard cost that has to be taken only when economic damage is seen in the
horizon. While preparing for risk you have to give some resources and slow
development pace but this was just a temporary cost. The preparation has to be
done the right time with the right knowledge basis so that will affect with the
minimum negative results development.</p>

<p><span>           At first,
I thought that invest equally in protection, insurance and research would drive
me to the finish line. I realized that this is not a winning combination. Risk
management has to be done in a smart way and in relation with the given
environment. While playing the game I learned that development has to be done
with measure and not exceed. The key to move forward is research and the right use
of knowledge. To invest in insurance measures only when needed and when the
potential threat is present, or else is just waste of resources. The resources
have to be used wisely and if so, during the game will be more than enough.  Another point is the protection, has to be in the
right levels before the time comes, so development will be delayed. If someone does
the opposite he will realize that development will take a step back. The
restructuring will be really costly, time and money wise.</span></p>

<p><span>           I
would change the factor of communication in the game. Connection between the research
pods and communication channels is one of the most important aspects of risk
management. The game is not giving such emphasis in right and effective
communication but just in connection among the pods. The handling and the
information passing have to be done correctly or else would be just meaningless
raw data without use. When someone has available proper knowledge should share
it as soon as possible in order to avoid time and resource loss. </span></p></div>
