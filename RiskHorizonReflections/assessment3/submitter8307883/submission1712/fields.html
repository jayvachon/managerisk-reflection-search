    <h1>Submission 1712 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307883, session_user_id: f7a2a3a4cc524256296119701028f13dd80c7f67)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Risk Horizon game gives a virtual experience on how risk
can be managed and how sometimes risk can be converted into opportunities for
growth and development. The game helps to understand the process of balancing
and managing risk better. </p>

<p>1.      
The game is focused on the process of building
and developing Alora when there is a constant threat of comets striking the
city and creating destruction. Thus it is very essential to focus on the
aspects of protection, insurance, development and research to manage risk
efficiently.  Risk management is of key
importance to build and develop the city of Alora. In the course of playing the
game it was very essential to ensure that proper protection in terms of
insurance is made when a comet has high possibility of striking and/or the severity
of the strike is high. It was equally essential to have adequate knowledge on
aspects such as the severity and the chance of strike of the comet to
efficiently manage the risk of strike. For this proper research is the key.
Risk-return tradeoff is the most important part of the game. Preparation for
the risk always has a trade off - Money for insurance and slow development when
the severity has to be managed by raising the city to protect it from the
seismic waves.</p>

<p>2.      
In the first attempt the focus was more on the
development of the city instead of balancing the aspects of development as well
as risk. Also it was difficult to decide which area to focus more on – The
mitigation of risk at the cost of development or at the cost of dollars. When
the game was played subsequently the focus was more on balancing the scenarios
of risk and development. The research area gained prominence as it helped to
decide if measures have to be taken to avoid the risk or face it. The learning
from the game is to understand when risk can be converted into avenues of
development, the importance of research to manage risk efficiently and how
prevention of risk through protection can save lot of damage.</p>

<p>3.      
The game majorly concentrates on risk due to
natural disaster i.e. the comet strike.  Focus
on financial risk can be increased by having a cost attached to research. To
make it locality friendly the population element could be bought in- increase
in population each level and causalities when comet strikes.</p></div>
