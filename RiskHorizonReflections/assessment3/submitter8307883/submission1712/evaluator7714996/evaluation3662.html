    <div class="field-value">The key of the reflection is the explanations of changes after the first trial: increasing the investment in research, whose effects could not have been realised first time the game is palyed, as clear as the effects of insurance and protection. 

I think the reflection could have omit some general statements as “Thus it is very essential to focus on the aspects of protection, insurance, development and research to manage risk efficiently.  Risk management is of key importance to build and develop the city of Alora”. I have also get confused when it is claimed that the game shows how and how sometimes risk can be converted into opportunities for growth and development, as I have not realised that possibility of “conversion” to opportunities.
