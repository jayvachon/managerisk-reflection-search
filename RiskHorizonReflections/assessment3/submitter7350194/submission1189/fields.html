    <h1>Submission 1189 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7350194, session_user_id: b8a8b40ddbea22f16e2776062d19a6936f2c0274)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management was to need to balance the three parts of protection,knowledge and insurance. The lack of experience in comet knowledge caused the protection decision hard to make.  To improve the protection leads to shortage of cash, the shortage of cash makes the development slow down,the growth slow down also.The insurance can claim the loss but the damage can cause the development slow down. Prepare for the risk need to buy reasonable premium insurance, but the shortage of risk knowledge makes insurance premium choose difficultly.</div><div>If I played the game only once, I would buy higher insurance.</div><div>If I can play more than once, I will reaserch the comets first.</div><div>During the early game period,I focused on higher insurance to hope less cash to claim the damaged. After I recognized the protection is the main job to help the development as well, I started to balance the development, insurance and protection. What I learnt from the game was that any kind of risk can cause the development slow down whatever level insurance I bought. Development is the first, then protection job,then insurance cover.<br />In the game captures,I have no ideas about game developing. </div><div><br /></div></div>
