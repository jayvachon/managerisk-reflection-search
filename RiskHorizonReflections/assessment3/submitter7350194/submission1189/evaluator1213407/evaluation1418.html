    <div class="field-value">KEY STRENGTH:
The reflection statements clearly show that the author learned quite a bit from playing the Horizons game. In particular, what I found interesting is that a position was taken on what is the right sequence of needed actions in risk management processes. Development comes first, then protection and then insurance. Although some other participants might disagree with the statement (they might say that you need to strike a balance among all three at the same time), I found that an informed position of this kind shows some degree of internalization of the training material and games reflection.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
The text was very brief and the quality (quite high indeed) of the many ideas expressed in such a short text somehow got lost a bit. For the future, I would suggest to articulate your thoughts a bit better so as to put your reader in a more relaxed and less chaotic state to fully benefit from your valuable contributions. This is something you might also want to take into account in developing the content of your final project. Good luck with your final project and the successful completion of this course!</div>
