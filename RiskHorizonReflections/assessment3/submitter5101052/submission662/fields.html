    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The way the game models the risk of a meteor strike resembles in some ways the most common shock people are prone to suffer: natural disasters. The key elements of risk management are present and well balanced. For instance, the building speed and development levels are related, so investing in protection decreases the development speed significantly. As in real life, focusing resources in mitigation/prevention impacts the time. Insurance is very useful, but very hard to manage since its usefulness is as uncertain as the meteor impacts. The continuous expansion of the community is a last issue to the manage because it enhance the complexity of the system.<br /></div>
