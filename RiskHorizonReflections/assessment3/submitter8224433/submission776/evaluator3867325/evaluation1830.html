    <div class="field-value">I believe that the candidate has done well and using this scenario in real-life, rainfall vs. insurance is an excellent idea. What I thought was a shortcoming was the fact that the value of insurance was undermined. I believe right though the game, at every level the value of investment in time, insurance (funds) and knowledge kept changing. The real strategy was to understand the threat from the 'Specific' comets and plan on protection/insurance accordingly. Early on, one can even take risk and 'wait-out' the comet hit to preserve the funds. If hit, the damage is minimal and if the comet misses, one can rapudly build out since the funds keep accumulating (unlike, insurance which requires funds even if you upgrade in the same level, and has to be repurchased at every level).</div>
