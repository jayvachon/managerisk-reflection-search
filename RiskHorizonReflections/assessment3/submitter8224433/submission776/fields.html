    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.	The role of risk management in this game is to balance the amount of effort (money) invested into development, protection and research for the successful growth of a community. By investing in the community development, which in turn increased the economic return, one had to an also invests in protection to reduce the propensity of a crisis, by avoiding negative impacts from the shock (the Asteroid hitting Earth). Whenever time was not enough to cover building protection, then insurance was a wise investment, which could reduce the amount needed to cover the damages, thus allowing you to keep developing at a constant speed, instead of spending large amounts in repair. Preparing for risk as investing on protection took some time and resources away from investment in development. Preparation was in the end the best type of investment to avoid the risk not only in response to the direct threat. It had to be done ahead of time, as sometimes a high-risk of impact and highly damaging meteor could come very fast. Therefore preparation ahead of time was necessary and it was the biggest differential factor, more than insurance, 

2.	I played the game several times and once I realized that the trick was to invest in protection to avoid damages from meteors, I did not spend any resources on insurance and had more available to further the development and upgrading of the community. I learned that time is precious when you invest in protection, you do not have the time to invest in the development of the community. One has to choose carefully where the community needs the most support according to the needs, imediate and future Balancing the amount invested in insurance, development and protection was the trick to reach the fifth level of the game. Research also helped, but whenever the development was being accomplished, in accordance to time. Whenever the minimum time limit was on red, meaning development was not taking place as it should, barely any efforts were given to research, a  commonly found in real life as well.WHen I was in Level 5, I was doing very well with a fully functioning upgraded community, but realized to late the protection from the asterois and tidal waves had gone down after a few minor hits and  a highly damaging Asteroid came. I had been investing too much in development and forgot to insure a highly developed community. The damages were catastrophic and I had to spend all my resources in repairing the community.

3.	One major change I would propose is to turn the theme of this game into a farming/rainfall insurance game.The change I would propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter where I live would not make much sense to me now. However, I do work with Africa a lot in wastewater treatment and reuse as fertigation for areas with lack of rain and groundwater. I would like to see a game like this in respect to the effect that rainfall insurance cause in India though. I am not entirely clear on how it works. The fact that farmers can pay the insurance when there are crops producing is understandable. However, if it does not rain, and the farmer does not have any product to sell, how could he have had afforded the insurance in the first place? Therefore, I would substitute the pods for crops and the asterois for droughts to see how this system is working.  Is it true that farmers only get their security insurance payments in case of no rain and he has produced no crops? </div>
