    <h1>Submission 1316 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2451111, session_user_id: d4e6dbba1d671437a1a34f7934f8d02aa4235803)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game was very important
as one has to decide whether to build Â with the given resources or has to take
insurance and in the same way recover from hit when the comet hits. In order to
make a community, building buildings was the first task second was to protect
them with the help of insurance or by taking people support. I chose to first
build whole community and then take people support. Main motto of this game was
to build a community protect it from hit and manage risk in a efficient way in the given time, with available resources.</p>

<p>Initially while playing for first time I was building and then
protecting the houses from hit and then was coping for hit by repairing them. Second
time I started to take insurance as soon as I build the house, 50% insurance in
order to protect from hit. In the next game I started taking people support
using that I reached 6th level, rather than taking insurance, taking
people support to avoid risk was a better option.</p>

<p>I would propose 100% insurance and a alarm to indicate when
ever a meteor hits the place, so that people will be cautious about the risk
involved if that hits the planet. I would keep some lifelines and increase the
levels to 8, thus increasing the risk levels in each level to check that well equipped
risk management techniques are used in order to protect from major threats.</p></div>
