    <h1>Submission 1384 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8287293, session_user_id: 4a897ce7f8b51498dfe50e375b0e3854450cea8a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal">The role of risk management in the game is to protect a
developing community against falling comets resembling coping with confronting
risks and the associated shocks. It guarantees the development procedure and helps
the network of pods to step forward and make more progress. The function of
risk managements can be considered as a virtual umbrella.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Knowledge was reflected mainly as the research option in the
box of each comet. It could however be connected with an understanding about
income and outcome to make wright decision, for example to choose proper
insurance plan. Keeping in mind that time management is essential, putting more
time for research to be done, provided more knowledge about the cometâ€™s
specification and consequently better chances to handle its included risks. To
protect the community, it was possible to match the level of protection with
the severity of comet by consuming proper time and money. As well, due to the
level of response of the player to the dynamism of the game, the level of insurance
could be also chosen to build extra support in case of possible damage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Preparation for risk could be fulfilled by availability of
financial resources and appropriate time management. Therefore, it affects the
development of the community in short-term view. But, because it reduces the
vulnerability and possibility of loss, it flourishes opportunities in future
for further more supported developments.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Actually, I played it several times to get understand the
role of different bottoms and their functions as well as managing the risks
considering different parallel actions. After the first time, I focused more
and more each time on my ability how to balance investing money for development
and spending for being more protected and well insured. It was obvious that
using more cost-effective risk management guarantees the future development
more appropriately. It was definitely the main thing I have learned from the
game.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If I would be tasked with developing a new version of the
game, I would propose to add some extra options which could make it more
sophisticated in final levels. One thing could be add to the game is the risk
management at the level of each unit of the community besides the general
insurance plan. It can show that the knowledge of small units of the community
could be also important and they can decide for more and different individual
actions toward risk management.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Another interesting thing could be also added to game. It
could be shown at the end of each level through an index how the efforts was
efficient or productive considering time, money, development level of community,
level of insurance used and so on.</p>
