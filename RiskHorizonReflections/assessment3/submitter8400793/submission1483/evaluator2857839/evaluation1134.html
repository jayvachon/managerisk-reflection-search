    <div class="field-value"> The key strength of this reflection is the player described what he or she did in the game,but didn't find or describe the winning way.Maybe he or she should make a strategy in different situation based on each kind of data in the game.The other key strength of this reflection is he want to add new feature about unforeseen problems of the development.That means he can contact the theory and the real world rather than just learning the knowledge of the lectures and materials.But in my opinion,the game is difficult and the goal is to understanding the essence of risk management.Since falling asteroids have the same essence with unforeseen problems of the development,it seems that no need to make the game more complex.In fact,I suggest add more time and data to remind the player doing the right choice rationally.</div>
