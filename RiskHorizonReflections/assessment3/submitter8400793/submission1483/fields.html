    <h1>Submission 1483 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8400793, session_user_id: 4282f56912dd771e1058f944e15ed995f947dc25)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in
this game was fairly clear. The player of the game was asked to balance between
development and the safety concerns of this virtual community. In order to pass
each level of the game, the game asked that the players to reach a certain
level of development goal. If this goal was not reached, the player lost the
game. Likewise, if the buildings faced damage due to falling asteroids, the
players also lost the game. In terms of knowledge, the players were given the
option to research the planet by clicking on the planet. Through this, the
players were able to assess the level of damage and the probability of the
asteroid hitting the planet. Through this, the players were able to set up a
method of protection or insurance by either raising the platform that the
cities were placed on or by purchasing insurance plans that covered parts of
the repair. However, protection and insurance did take a toll, meaning that it
did affect the rate of development. This meant that if the player played too
cautiously and did not effectively allocate the fund, the player would not be
able to reach the development goal in order to pass the level. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I played the game twice in order
to reach level four. For me, the second trial needed me to try and properly
manage the funds between protection and development. When a devastating
asteroid was about to impact on our planet, I purchased to heavily on the
insurance plan in order to make sure that I will be able to cover the repair
cost. However, this method proved to be unsuccessful by the third level as the
game’s difficulty increased. The high investment in insurance plans did not
seem to be cost efficient as the impact of some asteroids resulted in no
damage. Also, this hindered my development process, causing me to ultimately
lose the game. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I was in charge of modifying the
game in order to raise the difficulty and make it seem more realistic, I would
add new feature, where the users need to deal with unforeseen problems of the
development such as construction delays or natural disasters. These problems
will help the users fully understand the difficulty of risk management and help
the game be more realistic in order to help the users to be more prepared for
real world situations. This addition can really help to reflect the situation
of my country, South Korea, where there have recently been frequent cases of
disasters such as the recent Seowol Ferry incident where many Koreans perished.
Other incidents have happened such as Seowol, which have not only cost to
innocent lives, but also have claimed the national economy by slowing down
incident related services. </p></div>
