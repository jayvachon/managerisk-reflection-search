    <h1>Submission 764 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7247259, session_user_id: ec04c55f11c636e0fab3f4585cb10a6e0c13b128)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <strong>‘Risk Horizon’ </strong>game helped me
understand the subject of risk management in a different way.</p>

<p>The game is simple – you have some land
on which to develop ‘pods’. The faster you develop these, the further ahead you
reach. But, asteroids impact the land destroying the ‘pods’. This is the point
where the game becomes a bit more technical – you can buy insurance, rely on
research or use community efforts to help save the ‘pods’. And that way, you
will continue to progress. However, if you spend too much time on insuring/protecting your
‘pods’, you lose the time required to develop them.</p>

<p>I would say that since the entire game
is based on the idea of risk management, there is no such particular role that
risk management plays in the game, instead, taking risks and managing to succeed despite the risks is the game. I played
the game in such a way that I relied on protection first and then insurance
second. Because I relied on protection, I lost out on the time required to
develop the ‘pods’. As a result, my development was greatly affected.</p>

<p>Thus, when I first played the game, I
only made it to the second level and then, I lost. But I was determined to continue.
At first, I couldn’t understand what I was doing wrong but then, after losing a
few more times, I decided to adopt a new strategy – developing the ‘pods’ first
and then insure them. With this new strategy, I easily made it to the third
level but in the third level an asteroid hit destroyed most of my pods and my
insurance wasn't enough to cover the damage. As a result, I couldn't make it to
the fourth level. </p>

<p>So perhaps even this wasn't the right
way to proceed. I needed to find the right balance between development and
insurance/protection. I began the game once more and this time I only focused
on development in the first level. But once I reached the second level, I
switched tactics and focused on protecting the 'pods' that I had developed. This
did cost me time but I managed to make up for the lost time as none of my 'pods' were damaged during the asteroid strike. At the end of the second level, I
started developing my 'pods' again and as the third level started, I bought
insurance for all of them and worked on protection once more. This way, I
finally made it to the fourth level and even ended up making it to the fifth
level!</p>

<p>The main things that I learned from the
game were that a little bit of protection goes a long way in ensuring
development. Furthermore, if you protect your investment, you can keep increasing
it in a safe and stable manner. </p>

<p><span>If I had to add a feature to the game, I
would add more obstacles to development. The asteroids represent big challenges
that come your way but the game does not have any feature that represents the everyday
struggle to maintain your investment. Thus, I would make the 'pods' deteriorate
over time resulting in a lesser contribution to your development. You would
have to pay a maintenance fee to ensure that they started working at 100%
again.  </span></p>

<p><span>As a whole, I enjoyed the game and
thought that it was a good idea to include a game in this MOOC as it is a truly
hands on way to understand the subject. </span></p></div>
