    <div class="field-value"><ol><li><span>The role of risk management is to
develop our community to a better by my ability. When I make a decision, I will
trade off the knowledge,protection and insurance. If the chance of hitting is
high and the severity is a very shock, I will pay for the insurance which is  a high rate return one in advance. So the rate of the insurance I choose is depend on the magnitude of the risk.The preparation for risk affect
development after time.</span></li><li><span>If I try again to play the game I will pay more
attention to the pays and gains.That is to say, I will attach great importance to the lessons learned before. And the main things I learned from the game is
that the more I lift ,the more power will costs.Broadly speaking, high investment for high risk. However ,if you won't try because of the uncertainty, you may lost more. So . it is crucial to use your knowledge and research to make a relative insurable decision.</span></li><li>If I am tasked with developing a new version of the game, I will make the changes in the following.  The place where I plant pots will be related to the loss. If the pots is far from the shore, the waves caused by some comets won't damage the plot. So a well-placed pots will be able to miss the threatens. </li></ol></div>
