    <div class="field-value">It was a good reflection of what went wrong in the first round played and the consequences that have been drawn from it. But it seems as if the consequence was not the correct one. Unfortunately, it is not clear what the chosen strategy in the second round was, but it sounds like it was not tried to find the correct balance between all risk management tools, but rather focus on one of them, since it was said before, that "The first time I made a big mistake in trying to invest in all three". Thus, it was not clearly described what the chosen strategy in the second attempt was.</div>
