    <div class="field-value">Key Strength:
Your key strength is your understanding of Risk Management at the end.
After playing the game a few times, it seems like you have properly understood the application of key concepts of Risk Management and that can be seen in your description of your learning experience of playing the game. Keeping in mind the past experiences is also important while formulating a risk management strategy and balance between the possible strategies to reach the optimum one is the final step. You have very clearly illustrated that through your example of the various trade-offs and link to a real-world problem.


There's always room for improvement:
The reflection is balanced between a description of the game experience and your own learning experience. There were some key aspects you however did not include in the reflection, such as the role of community and the community connections aspect that appeared in the game after every comet strike.
Also, your description of your experience with protection indicates that you did not collect all the information possible (knowledge) before attempting the game, thus partially failing to actually exemplify one key principle of Risk Management.
Also, a deeper introspection of the game experience could have perhaps led to suggestion of an additional component to bring the aspects of risk management in the game closer to reality.
For example, an inclusion of the real-world risks you face in your environment would be an interesting customization to the game to better reflect the things to be taken into consideration while choosing the optimum risk management strategy, keeping in mind that there is always something unique in every situation and there is no textbook solution to major real-world problems.</div>
