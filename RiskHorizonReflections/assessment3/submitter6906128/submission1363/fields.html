    <h1>Submission 1363 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6906128, session_user_id: 636f5928280d3ac22f59ea44603ea2fe576b632e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Several attempts were made to run the game with application of divergent strategies. </div><div><br /></div><div>During first few attempts a bulk of resources were invested in 'preparation': research on possible risks , protection and insurance. The result seemed to be very positive. First risk caused damage of 40%, but due to prior investments in preparation (e.g. insurance) it became possible to 'cope' swiftly with destructions. As a result of high level of preparation next comets didn't cause any damage at all. </div><div>Yet, it came out that the spendings were not balanced and hampered development of the planet, hence the game was lost in 2nd round.</div><div><br /></div><div>In next attempts more balanced approach was chosen with a more care of steady growth of the community. Several dilemmas were faced, such as to invest limited available resources in protection or insurance. In this situation either the first option was chosen or - if possible - only a first level insurance was obtained with a rest of resources dedicated to risk management were put into protection and research. This strategy helped to reach 3rd round.</div><div><br /></div><div>The evidence showed also that in order to achieve steady growth of the community it is necessary in invest resources evenly in development of all pods. High level of differences between their advancement hampered the growth of community, whereas even distribution of available resources benefit it. </div><div><br /></div><div>If I had played one more time more resourced would be allocated in development and less precautious approach taken in risk management strategy. </div><div><br /></div><div>In my opinion it would be more interesting to see the particular needs of the community, not just a bar showing its level of development. For example despite having advanced and well protected pods the round was lost and I don't know the causes. I believe that a possibility of foreign loans also could be a valuable feature.<br /><br />I reached level 3 and obtained the following code - XGrSQDV. Unfortunately the system does not accept/recognise it.</div><div><br /></div></div>
