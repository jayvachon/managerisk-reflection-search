    <div class="field-value">The reflection is well-thought-out and had plenty of fair points dispersed throughout the essay. Unfortunately, the delivery of the information was downright shoddy, as (despite one semicolon,) one sentence lasted 5 LINES! The grammar was fairly poor and that made it fairly difficult to read.</div>
