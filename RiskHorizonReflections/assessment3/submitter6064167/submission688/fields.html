    <div class="field-value"><strong>                                                                            The game of risk management. <br /></strong>The game which has been organised by coursera to provide us with the insights of risk management has successfully done its work. The game required us to build more and more bots and protect them from comets heading towards them which could cause them damage. We had to cope with the damage caused by those comets by employing a mix of the three major strategies-<br /><br />1)Insurance<br />2)Development<br />3)Coping<br /><br />Insuring the bots helped us to lessen the cost of repairs when they are damaged.The compensation offered for repairing was available in three plans 25%,50% and 75%.THe 75% plan being the most expensive. <br />Development raised the level of all the bots to a certain height and thus protected them from the damage which could have occurred.However, the more the platform is raised the more cost is required to raise them further.<br />Coping involved repairing the bots once the damage has actually been done on the bots.It required money to repair them however if any insurance plan was taken the cost was compensated by the insurance company.<br />Our main task in the game was to make a balance of the above mentioned 3 things so as to minimize the  cost and also keep the bots working so as to fill up the meter and clear the level.<br /><br />When i played the game for the first time i didn't spend any amount on the insurance so i had to spend huge sums on repairing the bots.I was able to clear the first two levels but failed in the third level because a comet struck and i had no money to repair them.I realized tha i should have spent some amount on insurance as well.<br />The next time i played the game i bought a 75% insurance cover so the cost of repairing the bots when the damage occurred was reduced by huge extent and i was able to cope up and successfully cleared the 3rd level.However in the fifth level i failed may be because i didn't spend much amount on development .<br />But my performance improved a lot as compared to the first attempt and i was able to manage the risk better as compared to the first attempt.</div>
