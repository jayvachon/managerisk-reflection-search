    <h1>Submission 213 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3722819, session_user_id: 01e5d4cba24fd920af5501455aa734eff2e9d951)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this short game was really clear. We had to built a community on the space taking into account the risk from the possibility to be damaged by a meteorite. The trade offs we had to make were: -undertaking any insurance plans (from three different available) sacrificing money from the budget but covered for the damages, -researching the possibility that the meteorite will damage the community (trade-off of knowledge), and -raising the island to avoid the damage (trade-off between raising and budget spent). Preparation for risk affected development directly since the loss in the budget to cover for risk postponed upgrading of the houses or the number of the houses built in Aurora.

I played the game twice since the first time I was not really able to understand the functions and the instructions of the platform (not native English speaker and I don't really play games). In the second time that I played I undertook a better insurance plan (75% covering of damage), researched more the passing meteors and raising the island higher to avoid the more dangerous ones. However, these actions didn't allow me to built a bigger society and upgrade the existent houses. So losing level 2 was obvious and that I would change if I had time to play again. The main things I learned are researching for the risk, undertaking insurance for risk, and that these procedure can postponed development.

Because I live in Greece a simple and realistic option that I would add is to lose your budget for development.</div>
