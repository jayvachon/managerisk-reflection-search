    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><ol><li>the role of risk managementÂ in the game was to prevent damages in the developement of a community. the risks were act of gods and the game teachs to mitigate, by research or providing defenses, or to transfer, by assurances, the effect of the occurred events. in the game is possible to see that if we can protect our investments they produce more richness and wellness. we can see too that risk management in a continous process as risks are always present in. everybody's life. its good to know that research activities, improving knowledge and ability to react, are a good fence to prevent and cope with adverse situations.</li><li>I played four times and what I learned is that you have to provide more facilities as possible to raise money but even that you have always to prevent and train yourself to prevent and cope with risks. more your resources bigger the chances you have to succeed, earlier you start to improve your defences and to study problems bettr is your response. and finally, there is not just one action to react but you have to privide all your abilities to get your goal.</li><li>the one action to cope with risks that I have not seen in the game is sharing. developing community and relations improve the power of people to defence itself. more, I think that, specially by sharing, the game should offer opportunities and not only negative risks. getting oportunities is a way to accelerate development and so to get stronger against risks and damages. in my world we are not good to prevent and out lack of action often causes risks and damages even if is well known that prevention is not only healthier but even cheaper.</li></ol></div>
