    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The life isn´t a game; in the real world we take the best way, the way where we don´t lose and in this play we understood how confront the dangerous and take decision in strain moments.
The last show us, the importance of the risk managemet and how it will use in different situations and sabe our lives or simplify take the best alternative.
This game aren´t crazy, because in our world exist a lot of disasters and we don´t do anything, only watched it and suffer the consequence. That way, I don´t change anything because the risk always exist and we should react quickly. We can play again but in the real life we don´t do it, we only have one chance at same, in the game, We can found a variety of scene  where the risk are present like the financial (in the moment of buy), enviromental (the meteorite), logistics (where construct) in general analyze the different situations and mitigate the risk and do it the best way where we don´t lose or lose the less posible.
Mitigate the risk is something difficult but we can leran how take the best alternative or the best chance and use it for our benhavior.
anything in this world is another´s; the countrys are united, the economy and the global system are one, but everyone only search the self benhavior and sometimes forget the other people, like need a lot of things and need protection and this people are the most poor especially of conogsitive.
In general we learn playing and in this time, learned how the danger are around of us, but like in the game, we learn of the past and we can do best the next time, the cognositive show us how eliminated the risk and use it for take the opportunity.
The game show us a scene like too much people live, the case of living in a danger place where their lives are in danger but sometimes the blame is our, because taked bad options, don´t reason and think about the consecuense. We can applicated this in the place where we live, like don´t construc near of a river.
Depends of us eliminated the risk, do it the best posible and use the opportunity in our benhavior and in general thing about the posible risk and everithing like we do and do it search the opportunity.
