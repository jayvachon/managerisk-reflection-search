    <h1>Submission 247 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3659948, session_user_id: 9ff4ec788682bc54c5fd41de3cf74707534abce5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is all about how a decision can be taken which is to the most manages risk. The role of risk management in the game was to  balance risk preparation and healthy development of the community.We were required to save alora from shocks caused by the comets and thereby maintaining development.I took a note of research by clicking on the comets and became  aware of the potential threat it poses, besides this also i took insurance of 50%  and also protection indicator which was  used as an instrument by which we could move the level of mountain above depending on the number of times the indicator showed  ,so it meant to save the mountain from shocks which were a hinderance to development. Preparation affects  risk management which  includes knowledge, getting information on risk, but then using that information to make judgments, obtaining protection, measures to influence both the impact or probability of a shock, or obtaining insurance, measures to transfer resources from good to bad times or to those most in need in bad times.I played the game three to four times , at every next time i tried to take steps which i couldnâ€™t take earlier like increasing insurance and increasing meter indication everytime.Lastly their must be a one more hint or pattern which could clarify the game more easily.     </div>
