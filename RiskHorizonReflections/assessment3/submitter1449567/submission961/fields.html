    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The
game that was played was really interesting in terms of risk assessment and
prevention. The risk management was important to improve and make a better
growth of the community. It was about evaluating the risk of the every asteroid
falling down and make some decisions regarding the actions to do to reduce the
damage. In this case as in life and commerce in general, the damage was not
only the physical damage to the buildings but the economical damage to the
community in general. Personally, when I managed to pass the level, I put a lot
of efforts and resources in insurance and protection whilst the knowledge was
less important to me since the alley (or the unfortunate event in general) can
happen at any time and the community must be ready for it, no matter the
knowledge of the asteroids scenario  In
fact at the beginning I was a bit to confident I could make it with a low
protection level. After some time I realized it was too dangerous and I had to
take some measures to cope with risk and damages. Having played the games a few
times, I increased progressively the level of insurance and the protection, spending
less in growth and much less in knowledge. The result was a slower but safer
and more robust growth that could keep going for so much time. In general I
have learned from the game that the very first thing to do is to learn the
risk, the damage and the severity and the probability. It is important to know
what we are facing, what we can do and what we cannot do, the protection we can
adopt and the insurances available that can protect us and our interests. The
second step is to assess the balance between the amount of money that is spent
on growth (or on investments in general) and the resources spent on safety and
protection. This ratio increases with the severity of the damage and the probability
of the event. Sometimes the risk must be faced with a great investment in
safety, almost the same amount for the growth itself. This is the case of disaster
with huge impact (nuclear reactors, Wall Street servers and so on…) where we
cannot allow any kind of doubt or possibility that a disaster might happen. If
I were asked to develop a new version of the game and to update one thing, I would
propose to create another kind of damage that no one can take control of. In
life, there are always a few things that are out of control and, no matter how
prudent we are, they hit our life in such a way we cannot defend ourselves. In
general, this game does not foresee this kind of danger, but every business
faces unknown events or threats, be it a financial, structural or liquidity danger,
the resignation of an employee or any kind of threat we cannot defend ourselves
against. In the game, even if the damage could be so hard, the probability high
and the event frequent enough, there was always a way out of it, increasing the
protection and the insurance. It would be interesting to figure out a way to
depict a different and maybe harder scenario where some unknown events might occur
from time to time and there is no knowledge, prevention and insurance against
them. The only way out of it might be saving some resources to start over again
and differentiate the investments and resources. </span><br /></p></div>
