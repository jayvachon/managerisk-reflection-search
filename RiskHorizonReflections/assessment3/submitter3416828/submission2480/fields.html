    <h1>Submission 2480 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3416828, session_user_id: feddffc745bd6c7150a6d073c0131cb4dc185923)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game forces us to balance between information,
development, protection and insurance. I have learned that all comets,
embodiments of risks, are not created equal. Of course, it is very beneficial
to have a good insurance policy which is 75% in the game. But it hinders the
development which is why I lost in level 5. Another way to mitigate the risk is
by investing the protection which of course also cost. I think you always have
to press the button in order to increase the protection level. </p>

<p>The main reason I lost the game in level 5 is I lost focus
of my development. We can learn from that that a developed nation or society
can prepare for the risk better by increasing the protection level as well as
buying better insurance policy. It is also important that even if we can’t
quite see the risk yet, it is better to prepare ahead. (Some high impact comets
are fast in higher level.) </p>

<p>Next time I play the game again, I would try to not lose
track of development. I would still concentrate on protection because it seems
to pay off well. I would not try to buy insurance without having the good
amount of resources and I update the pod more regularly. (To my defense, I didn’t
know you can update the pod further until later)</p>

<p>If I am to change the game, I would add more types of risk.
I might add education like building more research centre which could give
better information. I might give some sort of bonus on better research risk. </p>
