    <div class="field-value">Thank you for your snapshopt of an answer. It is a very brief and coprehensive answer.
      But very important questions asked are missing:
What choices did you make? 
What are the trade-offs with which you have been confronted?
In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?
What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?

    You could try to review the questions again and try to write another complete answer, just for your own benefit.
