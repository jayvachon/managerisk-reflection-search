    <div class="field-value">I think this reflection is generally well-written! The key strength of this reflection consists two things: 1. Clear expressions -- Considering there tends to be a structure of this essay so the questions and the answers are matched clearly to see, the relevant ideas were presented with good logics. 2. the math calculations -- The writer did math evaluations when playing this game so this reflection contains numbers, which showed the proportion of each protection or development quite lively. One thing I think would make this reflection better is, however, the writer could add more things relevant to this specific course to make this reflection "closer" to the context of this course. I think, to enhance this kind of reflection could generally raise the value of this game, considering the game were played to practice things learnt in the course.</div>
