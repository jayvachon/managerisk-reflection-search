    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The experience while playing the game was amazing it was
just like any other role playing games played online. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Role in the game was to be prepared for any damages that
could have caused by the comets during the ongoing development to the pods. The
choice was always there as the amount in the start was less so there were
always trade offs in whether to upgrade the existing pods or buy an insurance
policy. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>To start off interms of knowledge, it was better understand
the different types of comets that were landing to hinder the development of
the pods. Interms of insurance 50% was purchased during the level one if
upgrades were to done to minimum of 4 pods. During the gameplay tradeoff were
faced in whether to buy insurance or make upgrades to the pods, and raising the
ground level were the pods were built on which affected my development bar as
it decreased the level of development to reach my goal. The best way was to always
fill the development bar till its full capacity so as to decrease the effort to
complete the development bar for the next level. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>For the fact I did not play the game only once, I played it
thrice. The second time I played I did not manage the risks well and ended up
in level 3. So in my third attempt I built many pods and insurance was a factor
that I considered not to be used as that amount was invested in building the
pods and raising the ground. If in case the severity of the meteor was greater
and I cannot match the ground level to the severity of the meteor then only I
would go ahead and purchase an insurance plan. 
Another factor that really helped me was that once the goal was
accomplished and still there was time remaining I would either do a development
or just let the revenue flow in so that in the next level. I would not face a
shortage of cash. Few main thing that I have learnt from the game would be the
essence of forecasting the probability in terms of making a better decision in
choosing an insurance option or upgrading a pod option. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>One simplified option that I would add to the game would be
an alert option if the comets were coming instead of them just flowing on the
screen.  An alert option would trigger
your capabilities in assessing the decision that needs to be implemented.                         </p></div>
