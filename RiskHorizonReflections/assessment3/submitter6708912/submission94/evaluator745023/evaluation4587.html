    <div class="field-value">This reflection captures  well the experience of role-playing a risk manager. The trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection and insurance, and how you altered their contribution to managing the risk as you played additional rounds are well emphasized. The reflection can still benefit from suggesting a change in the game mechanism that would enhance the learning experience. </div>
