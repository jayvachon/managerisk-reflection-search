    <h1>Submission 498 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6851724, session_user_id: 8caddae342feb988990c19232bb43d987ee5c286)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"> <strong>1</strong><br /><p class="MsoNormal">Risk Management, in parallel with the aspect of Developing a
new Civilization and Habitat, there is a fine balancing act to be done. The Risk-Triangle to be balanced off is having the three Variable entities of KNOWLEDGE,
PROTECTION, and INSURANCE.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The Risk Manager, who will achieve the final goal, with the
shortest time, will have a advantage.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As per Real world, the one who grows and achieve the <strong>Final
</strong><strong><em>saturation </em></strong>fastest will be the Leader (winner)consequently, to grow faster, i
left off, and sacrificed INSURANCE Variable for Protection.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Protection is a Pro-ACTIVE step towards achieving the
Objective; compared to paying for Insurance Which seems as a reactive mechanism
to a damage situation, which Provides compensation.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Being Pro-active and adding Pro-ACTIVE <span> </span>Measures for a Risk situation is far better
than Reactive action for a actual Risk scenarios.</p>



<p class="MsoNormal">Knowledge (RnD) and Analysis, always helps in taking decisions
towards Pro-active measures. Big-Data ANALYTICS, Data Warehousing and
Forecasting and many<span>  </span>mathematical algorithms
are derived , as tools for Pro-active measures.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Proactive preparation will always Out-weigh and Out-Shine,
reactive actions for Risk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>2</strong></p>Having played the game more than once, the main difference
would be to forego of getting high insurance premium Purchase, 

<p class="MsoNormal">and to use that funds to Protection step<span>  </span>and upgrading the Pods.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Quick upgrading of PODS to higher level, increases the
development in inflow and achievement.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Finally, never to stop the Growth and development , and never compromise the growth to cater to Protection/Research.</p><p class="MsoNormal">Protection, research aspects are good, but should be with inline and during Growth. If we stop for Research, protection the time will be up for Growth.<br /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Main learning aspects;</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Quick to utilize funds if to Develop fast.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Savings and keeping cash in hand is not worth, without Spending it.</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Risk management is not about the Cash Savings at hand,
but investing in the assets and Liquidity state of Assets.</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Being pro-active to Risk scenario's , rather than be reactive with repairing and paying up Insurance, after the damage is done.</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal"><strong>Invest in upgrades initially, do it fiercely as it takes time to reap benefits.<br /></strong></p><strong>

</strong><p class="MsoNormal"><strong> <br /></strong></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> </p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong>3 

</strong></p><p class="MsoNormal">-I would add Human Population aspect, to grow inside the
Pods.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">-With behaviors of Humans, the growth of Human numbers inside
the Pods.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> -Cash/Funds generation methodology for Human number inside a Pod, which will become efficient PODS with a learning curve.<br /></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The affects of Human behavior that affects the development
and incrementation of Risk.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would add, the increased<span> 
</span>Population growth and decrease of Land, assets, which consumes
Funds in a Exponential manner. There can be many scenarios and Combinations with this and many adverse and favorable conditions towards Risk..<br /></p>
