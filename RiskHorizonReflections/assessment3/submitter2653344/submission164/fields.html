    <h1>Submission 164 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2653344, session_user_id: 81a24ab0d5398e49e8aef7f8209a81d60bcf7207)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of the risk management is to balance three aspects: development, research and protection. I at first only built 2 or 3 pods and always buy the insurance of 50-75% coverage. After that, I built protection and when the shock came, I did research based on the severity and the chance of hit. If the shock with higher severity and large chance of hit, I did the research as longer as possible. I also considered the speed of the shock. The faster the speed was, the faster I did the research. If I had more money left, I will develop the pods and built the new one. I finished my game at level 5 and until level 5, I have not yet used all the spots. But at level 5, I delayed insurance purchase, since I thought doing good research is a good substitute for the insurance. Actually, I never used insurance in the game. <br /><br />If I can only play the game once, I will use more conservative strategy, like buy the insurance as much coverage as possible and increase the protection as higher as possible. But if I played more than once, I may use a bit aggressive strategy, like buying insurance with less coverage in the lower level, but doing research more frequently. The main things I learned from the game is the speed of the development should be at the same space as the speed of risk preparation. Unbalanced development ignoring risk management may cause some unrecoverable disasters. <br /><br />When I played the game, I think good research might be a good substitute for the insurance, since I almost never use the insurance after I did the research. I might think the frequency of the shocks is not well designed since I can always make enough research and suffer no damage. It seems to me that we should consider the situation when research is not enough and requires the purchase of insurance. <br /> </div>
