    <div class="field-value">The author of this reflection demonstrates an understanding of risk management, and its real-world implications.  You present your activities throughout the game, and even a critique of it. I like your suggestion very much - especially the self-help groups.  I think if this were included in the game then players would have a better understanding of how networks and grass-roots organizations can have a role in risk management.  Very good suggestion!  Some portions of your reflection are repetitive, and you should try to proof-read your work before submitting. I enjoyed your comments.</div>
