    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the fact that it explains the game by comparing it to real life scenarios, thus making it easier to understand for someone who did not play the game. 
The thing that I would chance to improve this reflection would be to give the ideas a more accurate feel, by making more exact comparisons (e.g. Between protection and insurance). When it comes to risk management we need to keep in mind that it all comes to making decisions based on expected returns and estimated costs, thus a thorough evaluation should be more oriented towards a more exact comparison between the choices made availabke in the game.</div>
