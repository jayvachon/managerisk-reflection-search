    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is in not just describing what happened to the student  as he or she played the game, but the "bigger picture" takeaways expressed.  The analysis and parallels between Risk Horizon and real life risk management scenarios is well articulated.

This reflection could have been even better if the student had continued in his or her good stead of analysis, and included that one element he or she would have changed or added, if tasked with creating a new version of Risk Horizon.  </div>
