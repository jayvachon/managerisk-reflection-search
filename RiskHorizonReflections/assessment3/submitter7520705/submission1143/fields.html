    <h1>Submission 1143 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7520705, session_user_id: 2d869f9b35c21a9334220c8a154bf84b5e99a76b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1/This is quite a challenging game to start with.  However, after several attempts, I began to understand to balance the requirements of being prepared financially, physically and mentally.  In this regard, there should be an awareness to address the risk itself by preparing the community on how to cope with the risk, by providing an avenue of coping by minimum insurance, and by knowledge of the risk itself.  These choices and trade offs also provide us with the time to reflect, rather than fire-fighting all the time.  Additionally, these choices have to be proportionate to the risks that we take - we might overspend, waste time and over protect, which may drain resources, increase worry and unnecessarily strain the relationship.<br /><br />The game also indicates that we have to be prepared all the time, especially during and after the shock.  For example, one need to improve/replenish the insurance that may be required to prepare for the next disaster.  Additionally, it may also be too late to prepare for the disaster if we were not prepared for it; insurance companies may not be able to provide this protection, or you might have to pay higher, or you do not have enough money to pay for it.<br /><br />On the other hand, in terms of development, there is an element of environmental sustainability, where you do not need to overbuild or overdevelopment as it may be bad for the environment and the community.   By building in a sustainable manner, we may also be able to cope with the disaster, provided that we are fully equipped with the knowledge of the risks and prepare the community for the disaster.<br /><br />2/I played this game more than once.  At first, it was just fire-fighting as I did not have the knowledge of the risks involved, the stakeholders and the element of coping.  Once I get the hang of it, I understand to sit back and analyze the situation, understand the risks and being prepared.  In this regard, I also understand that I do not have unlimited resources such as money and time, but I can rely on my community to help rebuild.  On the other hand, I also cannot avoid most of the risks; however, I can prepare for it and understand by undertaking research on the severity and impact of the risk.  A lot of time, people are not prepared for the risk, even though the know the potentiality of the disaster; they may not think that this disaster will happen in their lifetime, or they do not have the money or resources to address the risk.  However, some element of preparing is required, and this would require knowledge and information.  Once we have the information, we can influence individuals to make the decision, which may be disseminated throughout the community for a more effective and efficient implementation.<br /><br />3/If I were to develop a new version of this, I would also concentrate more on community participation, and how the community anticipates, prepares and copes with the risk and the impact of the shock.  This would enable be to understand the dynamics and requirements of the community, which may differ from one to another.  The diversity of the community could potentially improve and contribute to a more efficient and effective risk management.<br /><br />In improving risk management where I live, I would like to see more information on how the disaster like haze can be avoided via community participation.  Information on air quality is relevant, but information on other such as hotspots, availability of fire fighting elements such as water and river, information on who and how to contact, as well as the use of social media in the community could improve and assist in dealing with the impact of disaster.</div>
