    <div class="field-value">The key strengh of this essay is knowledge is the most important factor to measure risks. However, this is too simple and has no the writer's own thinking. I'd like to hear more explanation of the student if it is possible. I agree he/she doesn't like this game although my son likes it very much. I tried this game several times and got accustomed to the rule but I don't like it neither because it showed us too little information. It might be real as we suffer lack of knowledge as the writer said but if it gives us more exciting experince, it would be better.</div>
