    <div class="field-value">I enjoyed reading the various successes and challenges the writer encountered in playing game as they mirrored some of my own experiences, but I wish more space had been dedicated to personal reflection than the detailed description of the game activities. Moreover, in my opinion, the proposal to improve the game is a bit vague and not well linked to the existing game.</div>
