    <div class="field-value">The student's reflection is highly objective and it emphasizes howhe/she coped with the trade-offs of insuring as well as developing the village. Moreover, the reflection clearly states how difficult is to forecast all the adversities that may come.
Last but not least, I would like to congratulate my peer for his accurate work and thank him/her for sharing his/her reflections with us.
