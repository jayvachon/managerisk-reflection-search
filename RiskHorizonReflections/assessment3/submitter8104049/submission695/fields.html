    <h1>Submission 695 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8104049, session_user_id: 95888bdd92509f9046b54fca0665995e79bf6629)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I had problems playing the game, I have tried in firefox and in explorer but it did not function well, I have reached only 2 level although after submiting the game code it says I did not reached 2 level...<br />Anyway I could not use the button "protection" so I do not know how it would be if it worked, also while buying insurance, the box was getting blocked and sometimes I could buy it and in most of the cases I could not (although I had money).<br />So my observation is not worth much, I wanted first of all to get insurence and protection (not succed couse of problems) I prefered to have less plots but protected, which maybe was not good way of proceeding if the goal is to reach development, but from the other wayÂ  it should be also sustainable so maybe better to construct less but more secure. I did not spent much on research which I probably should.<br />Regarding risk related to the place I live now -well there is not much risks related with natural disasters or maybe more correctly is to say that they are managed well, which is not managed well is risk related with financial managment so we are in a huge crisis now. Would be necesary to add to risks related with natrual desater also financial risk.<br /></div>
