The reflection portrays the authors thoughts and emotions about the Risk Horizon game. It articulates the actions taken and how the course theory was applied. The examples of changes made also demonstrates how the knowledge from the course has been used.

One thing
To improve the reflection, perhaps a deeper description of the technical terms of Risk, Insurance, Protection and Knowledge could be added. The description of what occurred in the game and how it affected the outcome shows to depth of learning. However a short introduction of the technical aspects of Risk Management could complete the reflection. 

An excellent effort.  </div>
