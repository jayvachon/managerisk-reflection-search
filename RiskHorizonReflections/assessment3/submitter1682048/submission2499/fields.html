    <h1>Submission 2499 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1682048, session_user_id: 2950d0dd4e321921d4e64ad192d46b271da94f86)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of the risk management in the game was strategic. The trade offs were between resource availability (in economic terms) and investments into building the planet with minimum damage. It involved strategic decisions pertaining to the timing of investments as well as knowledge about the risks faced in case of a meteor strike. It also involved a tradeoff of making an upfront investment for insurance coverage versus a scenario of non coverage and paying the costs later on. Also looking at the severity and likelihood of occurrence of meteor strike (Knowledge) helped minimize the damage. The preparation in terms of buying upfront insurance helped minimize the damage of the strike. Similarly lifting the colony to level four too helped reduce the damage. Also looking at the meteor statistics (Probability of hit and likely Impact) helped allocate resources in an effective manner to reduce the overall damage. <br /><br />2. I played the game a couple of times. In the first time I had not purchased insurance and did not effectively utilize the statistics on meteors which lead me to loose out on level 2 of the game. After the first couple of times I tried to strategize by taking the insurance upfront which made me comfortable to use resources later on. Similarly I used statistics (Knowledge) effectively to make choices of protecting my spacecrafts. The main learnings from the game were learning to use risk management strategies to effectively protect oneself from risk which could have catastrophic consequences otherwise. <br /><br />3. If i were to change one thing in the game it would be to increase the risks faced in the game from just a meteor strike to <br />other risks such as flooding, lightening strike etc which would make it much more realistic in terms of risks faced in a real world scenario. This will make it resemble reality and help understand the choices that we make and the impacts that they can have on our future. <br /><br /></div>
