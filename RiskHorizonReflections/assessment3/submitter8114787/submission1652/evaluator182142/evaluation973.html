    <div class="field-value">Most of the situations described are familiar to my own experiences, like trying to keep a balance between risk management instruments to shrink damages most effectively, failing to sustain development while spending mostly on risk management etc. And  they are clear in the way they state the dilemmas, trade-offs that we face in the game, but the reflections on to what extent these methods were really helpful are not that clear and also missing I think. They are considered to be cost-effective and efficient, but at the end it seems like it all depends on luck, as if they don't amount that much.
