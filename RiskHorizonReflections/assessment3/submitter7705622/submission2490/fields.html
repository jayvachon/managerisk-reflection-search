    <h1>Submission 2490 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7705622, session_user_id: 65955af6d17c3e76a3556782420c8d8039f53981)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is pretty ambiguous. The knowledge of meteors is not extremely useful, rather the maximisation of house level is a form of insurance as this allows to rebuild faster. In my game I chose to adopt a protection strategy since the beginning, together with intense house building to replenish my resources. Namely, I found rather not useful to have precise knowledge of each meteor since many were coming anyway. What mattered in my opinion was the cumulative probability of at least x meteors striking; thus the single data point was not efficient for me.<br />If I was to play again I would build more houses first and focus on the post disaster recovery with the yellow lights as this minimises the costs. Namely, in all but one case I had to pay nothing thanks to this small inside game. Thus I never took insurance and I would not take it again; the inside game mimicks an insurance pretty well and for lower costs.<br />I would replace the liting of the community with the actual opportunity to build extra structures to prevent damages. The lifting is indeed unclear, especially for the costs. This does not allow a proper cost benefit analysis.<br /><br /></div>
