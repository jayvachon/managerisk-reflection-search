    <h1>Submission 1912 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4127769, session_user_id: bde8a43014206d56c7ec35429d740a684f89261e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1</p>

<p>What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you
make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection,
and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development
(immediately, or after some time)?</p>

<p>The role of risk management in this game is avoiding the civilization
been flooded when a comet hit the surface of the planet. By gaining knowledge about
the coming comets I have to decide on the right amount of protection in form of
raising the civilization higher. In case of unavoidable risk I could buy
insurance to share the cost of rebuilding the civilization after the hit.</p>

<p>Preparation affected the development immediately, I could not build as fast,
but the costs will be visible only if you compare the avoided losses with the
cost of raising the island.</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you
were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once,
what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you
learned from the game?</p>

<p>The second time I rather raise the island that pay the insurance and
rebuild the houses again, protection was more efficient. </p>

<p>3</p>

<p>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management.
Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows
you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better
represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</p>

<p> I will add some unpredictable events in form of aftershock, mistake in building
or more misleading information about the comets.</p><p></p><p></p></div>
