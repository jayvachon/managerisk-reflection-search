    <h1>Submission 190 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5564667, session_user_id: 9272399f6b741edee6f517ccde5c9f9332d5f01c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><b>First of all I want to say that it was a
fun game and I had a good time playing it. </b></p>

<p><b>At the beginning I didn’t understand what
the game had to do with the course but after a few times of playing it I realized
the importance of every single detail explained in the lectures and how to
relate it with the game. </b></p>

<p><b>The first thing I noticed is that it was
impossible to focus on one single aspect of the game, you couldn’t just buy
insurance and then forget about protection, or vice versa, neither you could
only get knowledge from the meteorites and react according to the new ones appearing
on the sky but actually you had to prevent for the appearance of new and more
dangerous ones with anticipation in order to cope with them in a better way. </b></p>

<p><b><span>I think that in the first two levels of
game it wasn’t necessary to buy insurance since you didn’t have all the houses
built or developed and you could cope with the meteorites by only increasing
your protection. On the other hand, after the 3th and 4th levels
insurance becomes essential since you can no longer get all the information
from the meteorites and increasing of protection becomes too time expensive to afford
so without any insurance preparations it would have been unaffordable and you would have lost the level.</span></b></p>

<p><b>In summary, you had to have a good
balance between the investments of time and money in the different aspects of
risk management in the game (knowledge, insurance, protection and coping).</b></p>

<p><b>If I had to make a change to the game I
will give some development value to the protection actions because in my
opinion protection is not a barrier for development as it happens in the game,
but instead since you are already spending money on it, it should be considered
as part of the improvements of your society. I think that in real life politicians
see investing in protection as it is presented in the game, they see it as an
obstacle instead of as a development since it is costly and do not present a
direct-immediate benefit for their purposes. </b></p>
