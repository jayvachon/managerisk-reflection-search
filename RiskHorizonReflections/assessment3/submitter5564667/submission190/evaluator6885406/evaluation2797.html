    <div class="field-value">You made a quite good reflection about the lessons learned in the game, providing clear examples and a concrete summary.

On the other hand, the answer to the second question is not clearly stated in your composition. There is no clear example of the actions you would take after playing the game one time, or the changes you would apply to your strategy after playing several times. 

Te rifaste (Well done!)</div>
