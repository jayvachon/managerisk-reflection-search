    <div class="field-value">1.	Nadine presented a very thoughtful and concise account about her insights about playing the game. I liked her break-down steps about managing risk short/medium/long goals. I think that having these milestones in a structured and holistic plan helps to maintain that continuity.

2.	My only suggestion will be tie those insights to the place where Nadine lives. How effective is this tier-goal plan to the current issues affecting her environment. I will think that every step is important; however resources/environment/governance varies from place-to-place. With that, one step might be more relevant than another given the influence of systemic and idiosyncrasies elements.
