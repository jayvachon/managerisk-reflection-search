    <h1>Submission 1904 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1328766, session_user_id: c93ca7f59066eb87577901c97d00c039be373f44)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the risk management game my role was very important. I needed to measure the risk of the meteors. I know the chance of hit, the severity and the protection. I needed to summarize them, and I must made a decision.<br />In the future game, I will make more protection, to keep off the critical damages. I learned that the protection and the alertness is very important.<br />In my opinion this game is very good. The Rick Horizon reflects the aspects of risk management very well. In the future versions I should prove the prevention of the hits, like I hit the meteors. It would be the special option, what require som research. Of course, my hits to the meteors should have the "chains of hits" too.<br /></div>
