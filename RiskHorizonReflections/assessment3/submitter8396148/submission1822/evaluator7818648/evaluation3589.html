    <div class="field-value">This reflection's key strength is that it clearly demarcates and evaluates the risk management strategies and describes which were most suited to the game environment. This reflection would have been improved by redrafting some of the more involved sentences to improve grammar and spelling, to clarify the intended meaning for the reader. The writer also dismissed the role of research in the real world, as well as the role of insurance in the game world, which is perhaps a premature assumption to make as research can only increase accuracy of the understanding of a risk, even if it cannot be pinpointed to an exact measurement. Insurance in the game world also played a part when catastrophic and unavoidable shocks took place.</div>
