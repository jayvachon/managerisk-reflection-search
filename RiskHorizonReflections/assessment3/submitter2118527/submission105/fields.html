    <h1>Submission 105 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2118527, session_user_id: 9f9fa166f83f982edea5c52d03491169026ffc63)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game we were tasked managing risk by preparing for
risk through researching incoming threats so that appropriate action could be
taken to mitigate its negative effects when it comes about and to build communities
and insure them against possible negative events all within a limited time and limited
resources. While researching I wasnâ€™t able to build or upgrade communities or
insure them so I had to prioritize researching about imminent threats over
insuring, building and upgrading them. Since the benefits of insuring, building
and upgrading communities was long term whereas the benefit of researching
about imminent threats was immediate, the choice was simple and realistic.
Preparation for risk slowed down development in the short term but helped
maintain communities and protected them from the floods and allowed the
communities to gradually and consistently develop over time.</p>

<p>If I played the game again I would use my time more
efficiently and coordinate between researching and developing/upgrading more
effectively by actively switching between them so that my money does not sit idle.
After playing the game the first time I tried to understand how communities
cooperated in times of crisis and worked on that and researched more intensively
to protect my communities from the expected threats. I learned from the game
how in a limited time with limited resources information gathering, risk
preparation, insurance and development can be conducted and the negative effects
of the crisis can be mitigated. I would make it possible for development of
communities and research of expected threats to be carried out simultaneously
but would make research a paid service to make the game more realistic as in
real life development and research do not really have to be chosen over the
other but rather the cost of research and development has to be paid if both
the tasks are to be carried out. If a community wants to prepare for a negative
event then it would have to devote resources to gather information regarding it
and taking precautions and to take certain actions to mitigate its negative
effects whereas the cost of development has to be paid as well, but both tasks
can be carried out simultaneously.</p>
