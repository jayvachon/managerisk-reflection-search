    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is the ability of the author to ensure that reader fully understands the content of her/his assignment and the very good use of english.  However, I would suggest more laconic (less but to the point) phrases, in all parts of the assignment (I..., I..., etc), rephrasing some parts of the assignment ("I had a great experience...causing devastation and damaging" It is quite clear that the enthousiasm is refered to the game and not the concequesnces of the devastation but still a bit bizzare showing that level of enthousiasm for games provoking damaging, especially on a report reflection) and a more conclusion-based final paragraph. An approximate grade would be 6.5/10</div>
