    <h1>Submission 652 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7934578, session_user_id: f4465e62368cb4f3781facc18cc224cb305f0dac)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>A
major characteristic of our world is change. Thus, everything within
this environment is in change accordingly. As a part of this world
our needs, desires, and expectations are in change as well.
Nevertheless, there are limitations and boundaries which we have to
consider while we are trying to adopt with the changing concept.</p>
<p>The
risk management game reflects three important concepts that related
to the change attribute of our world, these concepts are: knowledge,
protection, and insurance.</p>
<p>In
fact, the three concepts which were mentioned above are interrelated
activities. When it comes to the game, in order to build a city you need the “know
how”, which is the knowledge. At the beginning you need to educate
the community thus building research centre or education institution
is highly important. After creating a base of knowledge you need to
protect this base of knowledge from the surrounded risks (e.g.,
demolishing or disappeared of knowledge) by enhancing this knowledge base and put it
in practice, integrate the different pieces of information and add on
them. However, you should consider the available resources thus you
need to secure your community from different types of risks, such as
natural disaster or limited funds. Insurance coverage considered to
be a very effective way that will help to confront uncertainty and
possible risk by reducing the impact of unexpected or potential
consequences. Thus, the community will not stuck and it will be able
to adopt with sudden changes in circumstances.</p>
<p>Nevertheless,
overemphasizing the potential risk would hinder the development of
knowledge. Moreover, lack of planning for long term and concentrating
on short term gains will lead to a big loss eventually.</p>
<p><span>The
game could be improve by inserting the quality aspects. For instance,
offering different type of material to build the research centre with
different prices and different tolerance level to potential level.</span></p></div>
