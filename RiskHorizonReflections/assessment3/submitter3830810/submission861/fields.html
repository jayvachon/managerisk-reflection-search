    <h1>Submission 861 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3830810, session_user_id: cec9edce06dd2d610104259eb30eb572c6ca2707)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management playes a key role in the game: If the player only cares about developing buildings, comets (the risk) prevent him from earning enough credit. A more steady and safe development is achieved by investing time and money (water in the game) in avoiding or reducing the damage of comets.<br />Watching comets (equals knowledge) enables the player to take the right decisions, for instance weather it's more conveniant to protect or to insure. So it's really immporatnt to achieve the goals.<br />Protection (platform level) gives the chance to completely avoid risks, blocking all negative effects.<br />Insurance reduces significantly the impact of disasters. Therefore it's an alternative strategy to the (100%) protection. In the game and in real life protection is more expensive than insurance.<br /><br />After the first times I pplayed I realized it was key to use the money (water) rapidly eather for developing or to insure in fromnt of risks. Keeping money made you loose chances to achieve next level.<br /><br />In order to make the game kloser to real life, at least the one I live, the player should not have so much information about the comets. At least in my envoirement there's way more uncertainity in prices, sales, regulatory changes, etc. So what I would probably modify is the speed the comets characteritics may cahnge since its first appearence.<br /></div>
