    <h1>Submission 1775 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6805177, session_user_id: 76e221211bea4bbef34ecf7ba021c8631a2eb252)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>This game was extremely useful. With the help of this game I learned the key components of success: knowledge, protection, and insurance. Preparation for risk affected development after some time. This is because preparation is rather expensive and is getting more and more expensive in time.<br /><br />I played the game more than once. With every additional attempt I tried to do more research to learn new useful information about potential threatens. T<span>he main things I learned from the game is that it is extremely  important to prepare for the crisis in advance, use insurance intensively and continue constant learning and examining all the potential threats. <br /><br /></span><span> If I am tasked with developing a new version of the game? I would develop new mechanisms to destroy meteors before they hit the ground. Not all, but some kinds of meteors, so that it would be necessary to develop technologies and do more research to have an opportunity to destroy the meteor.</span><br /></div></div>
