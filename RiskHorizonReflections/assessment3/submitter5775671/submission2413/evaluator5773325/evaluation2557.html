    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is evaluation of risk. Student could understand importance of taking into account all 3 factors of play. However, he/she has not mentioned whether he/she could able to cross first level. Student could have given more time in analyzing comet. It was clearly mentioned in research what would be chances of comet to hit the planet and logic says as high are the chances, high is the probability of damage.
This reflection could have included evaluation of all 3 possible resources in order to prevent maximum damage because as an illuminator, you are using scarce resources of public i.e. dollars and they should be used in such a way that you get maximum protection with minimum expenditure.
