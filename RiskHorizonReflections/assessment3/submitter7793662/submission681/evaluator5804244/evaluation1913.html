    <div class="field-value">This is a very short reflection that does not respond entirely to the exam questions. By piecing the sentences together, I get the gist of this and understand what he/she is trying to say, having played the game myself and realising the strategy/trade-offs that need to be made. Having said that, there definition was not clear and the reflection that will bring this back to real life is absent.</div>
