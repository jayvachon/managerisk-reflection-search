    <div class="field-value">This reflection points out the importance of the risk management emphasized in the first  two weeks of the course. However, it does not answer the questions asked in this assignment. Especially, it does not convey how playing the game enhanced the learning experience. Highlighting the trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection, insurance and how did you alter their contribution to managing the risk as you played additional rounds would potentially improve the reflection.  </div>
