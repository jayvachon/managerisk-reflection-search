    <h1>Submission 1003 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6783877, session_user_id: f923006a136d319494a74c32b8922ff6fff92135)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game clearly
shows that preparation before shocks (falling comets) and coping afterward is
inevitable for growing a healthy community.</p>

<p>My choice was to build the pods at the first stage
with little or no insurance while researching on the falling comets to know the
severity and the probability of them hitting the pods (community). I leveraged
on protection based on the knowledge of research, and the community quick
response to natural disaster (falling comets) ensured little or no damage. The
major trade-off I confronted was between protection and insurance. Preparation
for risk afforded me to record little or damage immediately the comets hit and
helped built a safer community over the next stages.</p>I played the game severally, my aim was to reach
the marked development bar quickly on each level so i could build more protection
within the remaining time for the next round.

<p>Indeed, i have learnt that trade-offs between the
components of risk are necessary when confronting risk. I have also come to the
knowledge that risk cannot be wished away, it must be confronted by and
prepared for. Inactions can be costly.</p>



<p>The only change i will make to a new version of
the game is such that everyone must get insurance no matter how little,
otherwise they wonâ€™t progress to the next stage. Reason is because where i live, insurance cannot be over emphasized.
People despite knowledge of risk tends to overlook the importance of insurance,
hence, it cost them a lot while trying to cope with loss as a result of
negative risk.</p>
