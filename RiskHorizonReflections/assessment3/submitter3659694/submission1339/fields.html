    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p> <strong>Q1</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>The role of risk management was:</strong></p>

<p></p><ul><li>to prioritize the needed
response to face the threats  vis-à-vis
following the developmental goals<br /></li><li>to keep track of available
options of response<br /></li><li>to have a holistic view of
the current situation and calculate the risks<br /></li><li>to distribute resources
between prevention, response and development.<br /></li><li>To understand the current capabilities
and what needs to be improved.<br /></li></ul><p><strong>The choices &amp; tradeoffs between knowledge, protection
&amp; insurance:</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p></p><ul><li>Knowledge cost less than
insurance and protection, so it was important to use it properly, especially
when I had time to react.<br /></li><li>Knowledge on higher
intensity risks was more important than knowledge on low intensity risks.<br /></li><li>Protection was a key
decision, even though it paused development. It was crucial to foster my
support system as much as possible.<br /></li><li>On the other hand, too much
protection was not a good option, and sometimes I had to let go and face the
hit, and after that calculate the costs of recovery.<br /></li><li>I relied too much on
insurance at the beginning because I knew that my preparation will not stand in
front of a strong comet. Later on, I chose cheaper insurance packages cause I
was better prepared.<br /></li><li>During the early phases of
the crisis, Knowledge was very important, and decisions regarding insurance had
to be made. But when the threat is imminent, protection was the key action.<br /></li></ul><p><strong>Preparation for risk affected development in different ways:</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><span>·        
</span>As a general rule, preparation
reduced the financial resources available for development.</p>

<p><span>·        
</span>On the other hand,
preparation allowed swifter recovery which helped me bring development back on
track.</p>

<p><strong>Q2</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>After playing several times, I started:</strong></p>

<p></p><ul><li>Focusing on early
preparation as much as I can,<br /></li><li>Prioritizing the threats
according to intensity &amp; speed,<br /></li><li>Delaying full scale
development until I had enough preparation,<br /></li><li>Choosing expensive
insurance when protection was inadequate, and less expensive insurance when it
was improved.<br /></li></ul><p><strong>I learned from the game:</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p></p><ul><li>How to handle resources in
times of crises, either financial or available time.<br /></li><li>Prioritizing threats
according to intensity to focus on severe ones, while not neglecting smaller
risks.<br /></li><li>I improved my grasp on the
dynamics of risk management, especially when it’s related to preventive measures,
the role of research, transferring risks, crisis response,,,<br /></li></ul><p><strong>Q3</strong></p><strong>

</strong><p><strong>If I propose changes in the game, I would have:</strong></p>

<p></p><ul><li>Focused on the response
part a bit more because it is crucial and has a deep impact on the rest of the
recovery track.<br /></li><li>Added other variables such
as food, water, shelter, energy ,,, to make it more realistic.<br /></li><li>Added various levels of
impact according to location and value<br /></li><li>Added the stability &amp; security dimensions</li></ul></div>
