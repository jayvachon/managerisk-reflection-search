    <div class="field-value">the key strength of this reflection is that the student has very profoundly put forward his/her learning experience of the game. he/she has clearly articulated how he/she used the three tools of risk management to reach level 6 in the game and also pointed out the mistakes he/she made and the measures and strategies he/she deployed to correct them.
the student has very clearly articulated his/her learning experience through the reflection. i cannot think of any recommendations to make the reflection better.
