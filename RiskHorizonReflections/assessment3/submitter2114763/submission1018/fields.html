    <h1>Submission 1018 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2114763, session_user_id: 32993165e87492e7887560757e06def608765863)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. <strong>Risk management </strong>was about
assessing idiomatic risks, such as the speed of development with systemic risks
of tidal waves and time-outs. My ambition began as a moral hazard, as I didn’t
have the initial <strong>knowledge</strong> through experience. I found it hard to assess in
real time the value of pods against damage inflicted upon them and the
i<strong>nsurance/savings</strong> needed to cover this. This prevented growth past level 3.</p>

<p>Raising the ground level at
the beginning was a simple, lasting form of <strong>protection</strong>, outside each level’s
time constraints.</p>

<p>First, I bought 75%
<strong>insurance</strong> to overcompensate for damage costs, but when that reduced income for
growth, I went for 50%, and allowed the community to grow wealth to cover own
risk through savings. Cash flow was a major risk factor to growth.</p>

<p>How quickly I made community
connections after a disaster was decisive in reducing damage through coping and
<strong>protection</strong>.</p>

<p>What was I supposed to learn
from the comet analysis at the end of each round? I experienced<strong> cognitive
failure</strong>, a clear obstacle to my <strong>knowledge</strong> of risk management.</p>

<p>2. I played a number of
times, always failing to balance<strong> insurance</strong> and time at level 3, even when I
took a longer view. At first, there was a phase of learning how the game
reacted, and time constraints plus ambition led to<strong> myopia</strong>. I became too big too
fast. I tried slowing down growth, so my <strong>insurance</strong> claims would be less
dramatic. Doing the game again, I would try to calculate the hard costs from
the data during and after each level, to make clearer decisions.</p>

<p>The inevitable supercomet at
the end of level 3 means there is no risk. Therefore development must be steep
in this level, so that the growth is not set back to a point that cannot be
rescued in the remaining time.</p>

<p>3. I would change my<strong>
insurance</strong> company, and clarify the meaning of the statistics after each round. I
want to to upgrade between 50% to 75% by paying the DIFFERENCE in premiums.
Here, the cancellation of one policy and the beginning of another is a rubbish
deal.</p>

<p><span>Here in Germany, everything
is over-insured, and companies earn millions from complex policies that create deliberate
<strong>cognitive failure</strong> in the customer. Meanwhile, my friends in Iraq refuse to
leave home, in spite of invasion by ISIS, because they are bound by a duty to
their family. In other words, under over-certain or extremely uncertain
circumstances, some people lose trust in institutions and choose to<strong> cope</strong>. This reflects the google hangout point that one must try to
understand why people don’t appear to manage risk.</span></p></div>
