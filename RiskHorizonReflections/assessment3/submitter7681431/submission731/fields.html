    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>1.</strong> The provision of learning about risk management is well reflected in the "Risk Horizon" game. All aspects of risk management including knowledge (based on research), protection, insurance and coping can be appreciated using this simple and interesting game. The game uses a case of community building. This process of community building, with all activities in the game costing a price. Community building process is however prone to various risks, which in this case is the presence of comets. <br /><br />This is where the role of risk management has been reflected. Based on the the probability of comet hitting the community, knowledge about the comet (which is the associated risk), and severity of hit are the basis which foster the need for proper risk management to effectively develop the community with minimum loss. Insurance and "lifting the village"  has been provided as a medium to reduce impacts of risk of comet impeding community development. To manage risk, I used "lifting of village" facility to protect, and "insurance (schemes available based on risk coverage and money for a particular risk)" facility to cope with a risk comet. My decision of the facility to be used, depended on the knowledge about the comet which is based on research. When the chances of comet hitting was high along with high severity, then I included insurance, so as to reduce the time to achieve rapid growth of community. Based on such combination, trade offs were used keeping in consideration the cost factor associated to protection and resilience. Finally research about the risk was importance to take a decision on balancing money spend in lifting and insurance and severity of  risk.  <br /><br />Awareness about the associated risk, and preparation for it reduced the time taken to develop the community. In the absence of risk management, the community or a development activity will be continuously prone to destructive impact of risk. Preparation has helped in preventing or reducing the devastating impact by a well planed protection and coping mechanism. Preparation for risk before hand, enabled improved response and thereby facilitating development with increased reliability. <br /><br /><strong>2.</strong> After playing the game, over and over again I learnt that knowledge about the risk can be extremely useful to planning and decision making. When playing it again, I came to appreciate that careful attention must be provided to all three factors which indicate risk, these include:  seeing the probability of event, scale of destruction and research on risk. By improving my ability to manage risk, I gradually learnt that it must be done in cost effective manner, finally bringing me to the conclusion that such a management must be carefully done by considering the cost associated to it. This is  possible based on knowledge and data about the risk, as well experience. I have mentioned experience, because as part of this game exercise, I learnt that each time I played the game, I got better at it. <br /><br /><strong>3.</strong> When tasked with developing a new version of game, I would include other objects of risk with progress in levels. For e.g. one more risk object could be included. Another aspect that I would introduce would be the impact options, for e.g. agriculture could be included. The risk would be either for housing, agriculture OR both.  </div>
