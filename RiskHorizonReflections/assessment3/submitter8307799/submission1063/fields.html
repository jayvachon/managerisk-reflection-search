    <h1>Submission 1063 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8307799, session_user_id: bf16a8fc2c864a5c1d4301a08e9f995956cd4f26)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>RISK AND OPPORTUNITY: MANAGING RISK FOR DEVELOPMENT- REFLECTION</p>

<p>To manage risk efficiently one must have information, resources
and insurance in order to protect oneself from uncalled for events. The role of
risk management in the game was to be always prepared because the comet could
strike Alora at any time. The choices that I made was to always have insurance
at all times. I did this because I noticed that rebuilding was cheaper with
insurance than without it and therefore I always made sure I has at least the
least costing Insurance if the not the costlier one. Given the fact that
knowledge, protection and insurance are essential, these three factors do not
work independently. They are interdependent and this makes risk management
efficient. Just having knowledge would not suffice as you cannot battle a
crisis in the best possible manner without the rest and the same scenario would
apply to protection and insurance. In the game, preparing for the risk affects
the development immediately. A good chunk of financial resources would go away
due to the investment in insurance and elevating the area of Alora to protect
it from the waves and comets. After a hit from comet the developments would
again slow down as time and resources are again spent on repairing the damaged
caused.</p>

<p>When I played the game for the first time I concentrated too
much only on development, insurance and protection. And if I had played the
game only once I should have also spent more time on research. On the other
hand I played the game more than once, therefore I did try my best to strike a
balance on Development, Protection, Insurance and Research. The take away the I
got from playing this game was to be geared up to address whatever situation
that pose a threat to survival as the world is full of uncertainties. </p>

<p>Agriculture plays vital role in many countries and India is one
such country. As I live in India agriculture here is said to have accounted for
17% of its GDP in the 2012. Therefore instead of comets I would propose to base
risk on Rainfall. About 60-70% of India’s water is utilised for the purpose of agriculture
and without rainfall the country would go haywire. This change would be
substantial here because I learnt in week one about index insurance wherein the
index would be based on rainfall and thus such an insurance would benefit
exceptionally in managing risk.</p>

<p>So, to conclude by playing the game one learns how development,
information, protections, insurance, resources, research etc works together and
one cannot really judge which aspect is more important than the other. Hence it
essential to look at all the aspects simultaneously to win over a disaster.</p>
