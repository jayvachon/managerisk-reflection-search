    <h1>Submission 1201 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7631820, session_user_id: 451b045c201d90248210485b7115a4e73510facf)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      I’d
like to think that the game, simple as it is, tries to simulate the risks
present on our society especially due to natural disasters. Comets are good representation
for these risks. The “money-making” pods can generate more revenue if you
upgrade it but complete disregard to the threats of destruction from the comets
can totally destroy them.  By not buying
at least 50% guaranteed insurance added a burden costing a lot of money that
could halt further investments to build more pods or to upgrade existing ones.
(I only buy 50% insurance because 75% is really costly and it is more important
for me to have insurance at the early stage of the game and noting that there
is advantage in this practice. This is actually true in practice. When you buy insurance
at your young age, you actually pay less.) Research has a really good point. In
my case, I do some kind of pre-assessment of which comets, if there are many,
possesses greater risks than others, i.e. likelihood of hitting and the possible
extent of damage. That is nice. It means that there are a lot of possible
scenarios that can and should influence your decision making. It could: </p>

<p>1.     
Low likelihood of hitting and low possibility of
the extent of damage</p>

<p>2.     
Low likelihood of hitting but high possibility of
the extent of damage</p>

<p>3.     
High likelihood of hitting but low possibility
of the extent of damage; and</p>

<p>4.     
High likelihood of hitting and high possibility of
the extent of damage.</p>

<p>Another factor
to consider is their speed. Here is a slow, low likelihood of hitting but high possibility
of the extent of damage  being overtaken
by fast high likelihood of hitting and low possibility of the extent of the damage.
Ideally, I’ll have scoring mechanism and score a given condition based on
several matrices. Say I’ll rate the risks from 0 to 10 with 0 means no risks at
all and 10 with very high risk base on”:</p>

<p>1.     
The like hood of hitting</p>

<p>2.     
The possible extent of damage; and</p>

<p>3.     
Speed</p>

<p>And add them.
The score with 30/30 should means very high risk and should be dealt promptly.
The other main feature of the game is “protection”. I suppose that would
represent an overall strength of the community; referring to the strength of
the infrastructure and may also include response readiness in times of
disasters. </p>

<p>So, how do I
decide in the game to “manage the risks”? I guestimate the risk profile of a
given comet and when no comet is visible, I build more pods and upgrade
existing ones very quickly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2.      I
made few mistakes in the first game of underestimating the damage of low risk
comets and have been hit by few of them. So, in the second game I did not
become complacent to those comets and spend time researching them – although they
have to be on the bottom inn the list of priorities when other comets deserve
larger attention.</p>

<p>3.      I
think one modification I can think of to improve the game is that higher level
pods should be more resilient to damage than low level pods. Or, there would be
options on the pods like you can upgrade it with low cost but it is low
resilient or with corresponding high cost and high resilient.</p></div>
