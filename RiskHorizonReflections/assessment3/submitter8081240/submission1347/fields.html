    <h1>Submission 1347 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8081240, session_user_id: 4bfb2087445d37a6e12c5134ba3e5b94e6d6ba09)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>At start, I was, like other course-mates, confused though I started
systematically; reading guidelines and postings and tutorial. However, I
managed to reach level 4. Interestingly,, in a second attempt, I lost level 3,
then level 2 and then level 1. I was of the impression that the more trials you
give, the harder the game goes, even at the lowest level? I am still not clear,
probably I did a mistake not to play games on computer. While agreeing to large
majority of the peers comments, I can only express the game I played, and off
course enjoyed too, in following lines:</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>I had the 1st choice of how much of money I had to
spend on development by building and upgrading the pods. Since the pods were helpful
in generating growth and were the major contributors to the speed of development
meter I had to give time on constructing and up-grading them. Second choice
available to me was how much of money and time I had to spend on preparation
for risk by purchasing insurance, protecting the pods by raising the level of my
community, or researching the probability and severity of comets coming towards
the community across the horizon. As I had to keep in mind that if I spend more
time researching I get maximum time to boost my protection by building
community protection when a comet hits.</span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>As I was playing the game I realized that striking a balance
between these above choices is very difficult. I had the fear that if I spend
too much on building and upgrading pods, may be I am exposed to comets. The comets
were hitting and causing damage to the progress bar pushing it to decrease. On
the contrary, spending much of resources on preparation for risk, I had to be
bankrupt and could not develop my community. I realized that these decisions
are very difficult therefore policy makers and planners more oftenly face such
situations and failing to make a balanced decision put the economy in deep
crises. With limited resources, policy makers’ choices between spending up
front on risk management for shocks or to spend on other development programmes.
</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Keeping these options in front, I opted not to build all the
pods at once but gradually. In first level I built only two Pods and upgraded them
to full. Similarly, in the second level I kept building other three pods and
upgraded them to full, so and so forth. This method helped greatly in raising the
green bar, and also saving the financial resources. While I was building the
pods I was also looking at comets which increase helped in research on each
comet and also helping to raise the bar. Insurance options were also used and
being revised oftenly.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I also observed that the more time I spent on protection the
lesser the pods were developing\strengthening. One useful method that helped getting
the goal accomplished was avoiding investing in insurance all the resources, as
that was a waste of scare financial resources. Rather spending higher time on
researching the comets and on building protection did well. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>This game which in the start was looked frustrating helped
realizing the importance of making decisions in a complex situation where you
had to make difficult choices.</p><span>
