    <h1>Submission 1400 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8170755, session_user_id: b4be67b77d26b33776f88581e4d4c95bacf7e103)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>There’s
some shocks in the game which was associated with the process of terraforming
the new planet. First of them is negative. Waves caused by falling comets may
hinder development at Alora. And second of them is positive – it’s power of
development. Welfare of society depends on these shocks directly that’s why
risk management is an important prerequisite for sustainable development. If we
are concentrating on the development, we will get a great results but this
result can be ruined by the shock.  My
way in the game was a using of combination risk management tools, and here are the
results I got.</span></p>

<p>At first
preparation for risk depend on some factors. The shock of falling comets is unpredictable
all the time but if it has already appeared we may predict the chance of the
comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet. If the
risk is not high, we can spend the resources on the development of community
and on the protection. But the threat of serious damage requires saving
resources to repair damage. </p>

<p><span>The
measures of preparation for risk is hinder development noticeably. That’s why
obtaining protection affect development immediately and there is should be
enough time for growth of welfare.  But in
the long term high level of protection can help to preserve the achievements
and so protection should grow slowly but constantly.</span></p>

<p>Obtaining
insurance is the tools to transfer resources between good and bad periods. It’s
may be ignored for development but it should applied if outcomes of risk by acquired
information will to costly.</p>

<p>And even we
have a much recourses to cost for damages it will not lead to a favorable
outcome, if the development and protection did unbalanced. We should be to keep
save the communities from negative outcomes and if the protection is high there
will be less damages or nothing.</p>

<p>I have
played the game more the one time. And I tried to use risk management’s tools
more effectively next. There the unpredictability of falling comets was the
biggest challenge but I realized that good developed community with a high
level of protection can deal with any negative outcomes. And the week community
should be to looking for more comfortable planet. At last, I couldn’t finish
the game successfully and I hope reflections of other participants will answer
why.</p>

<p><span>It would be
interesting to know the connection between protection and growth of technical
development. Perhaps it will help to create a new way of response a shocks over
time. I think it may be simple thing to developing a new version of the game.</span></p></div>
