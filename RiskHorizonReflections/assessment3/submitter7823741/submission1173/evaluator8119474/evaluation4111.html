    <div class="field-value">I believe this Student has a very good understanding of what is the role of protection and insurance and has played the game in accordance with that understanding (this is in particular shown by its suggestion on question 3). 
I do believe that to improve its reflection, this Student might have given more importance to the role of knowledge and information, considering that looking at his/her Game strategy it seems not to play a significant role. Also, it should be pointed out that to wildly increase and boost assets just because comets' are unavoidable seems to give the impression that the unavoidability of the risk gives an incentive to better coping (by having more assets at hand) than to better preventing (considering the risk will occur anyhow) which seems not to be in line with the best risk management practices. </div>
