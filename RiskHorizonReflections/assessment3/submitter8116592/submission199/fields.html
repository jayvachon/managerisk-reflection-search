    <h1>Submission 199 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8116592, session_user_id: aa0e158258c3045b413f607263d4ea75c11f60ad)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div>By conducting research on the meteor, buying insurance and constantly upgrading my buildings, I managed risk by applying the knowledge enhancement, protection and insurance principles taught in the course. The preparation affected such  that the knowledge on the meteor gave me information to choose between different kinds of insurance. After the shock destroyed my property, the insurance paid off and helped me rebuild. Also, the risk sharing among community members helped overcome some shock. </div></div><div><div>If I were to play again, then I would do more research on the meteorite and update my knowledge of future shocks, protection and insurance via repeated experiences such that I could learn the pattern and make informed decision appropriately. The main things that the game taught me is that we have to constantly update our knowledge, build protection and insurance accordingly to create opportunities from negative or positive shocks.<br /></div></div><div><div>If I were to develop a new version of the game, I would take out the community sharing risk property for few steps in the game in order to create systemic risk scenario. This is because farmers in many developing countries from the same area face risks such as drought and flood, which affects the whole community and noone able to help others. <br /></div></div></div>
