    <div class="field-value"><p><b>My Game Reflection  </b>:<br /></p>

<p>The role
of risk management in the game, as I saw it, was to show the importance of risk
management for healthy development of the stated community. Better preparation,
longer researching and comparable protection and insurance levels, helped to defend
the damaging effects of waves from comets on the one hand and tested the
ability of the community for faster repair and recovery when the level of
protection did not cope with the severity of the damage on the other hand,
which I thought were reflections of the situation in the real world.</p>

<p>To
be better prepared and minimize the risk of waves from comets as shocks and to
recover the community faster, I applied the effective risk management components
of research/Knowledge, protection and insurance. In so doing, it was not an
easy choice given the limited resources of time and money. While research gave
me a better insight about the severity and probability of the shock from comets
and hence more time for preparation, the cost for protection and insurance was
challenging as it had a direct implication on the development efforts. Too much
emphasis on preparation left fewer resources for development of the community and too much
emphasis on development left the later without protection. So, a balance
between the two was a necessary step  I took during the game.</p>

<p>When
I played the game the first time, I felt nervous for fear that I might not
control the situation at the screen. I even felt that a person better on games
might progress well ahead without understanding the concept of risk
management. Plus, at the first play, I didn’t give much attention to research
which I later realized the importance of researching the horizon for better preparation for future shocks and took action afterwards. </p>

<p>The
most important lessons, I believe, I take from playing this game are;  the importance of balance in deploying
resources for preparation for risk management and pursuing development opportunities, the
importance of knowledge or research for better preparation for future shocks,
and the importance of practice, as was the case in the game,of the scientific approaches of effective risk
management tools. </p>

<p>In the mean time, if I
had to suggest an improvement on the game, it would be the high probability of
comets as shocks. For the game to represent the case on the real world,
probably in my area, I thought, comets should appear less often and less severe , otherwise, we
wouldn't be survived at any level of preparation.</p>
