    <div class="field-value">From your writing follows that you put a lot of effort and time into thinking about the optimal strategy to follow in the game. It is therefore obvious to me that you applied the theory learned in this course into practice. 
The first question asked in the exercise, about the choices and trade-offs made, I feel like you gave a very general overview. However, I would have liked for you to go into more detail about the choices YOU made. It is not clear from your writing if you invested heavily in preparation or insurance, which I would have liked to know.  </div>
