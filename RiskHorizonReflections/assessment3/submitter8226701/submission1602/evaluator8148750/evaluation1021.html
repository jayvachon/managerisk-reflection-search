    <div class="field-value">This reflection is very clear and well articulated, and shows a deep understanding of the key concepts of the course. The critical and positive aspects of each element of risk management are evaluated and commented, and their combination and effectiveness in the game is well described as well. The writer also makes a very interesting point when s/he proposes to add to the game the possibility to make communities communicate also before the disaster. Effective communication and coordination are key conditions for an effective risk management also in real life, as well highlighted in the example related to the writer's country.
In my humble opinion this reflection is already very well written and I cannot suggest one thing to make it better. </div>
