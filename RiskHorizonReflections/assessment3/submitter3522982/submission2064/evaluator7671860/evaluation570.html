    <div class="field-value">Thank you for your essay.

You very well devloped the trade-off of research and protection. And you very well explained the three different possibilties of preparation.

But you should balance the answers more accordingly to the questions asked. There is a very large passage about the three possibilities to prepare but the ohter questions are tackled much more briefly. You even didn't write an answer to the the risk management choices that matter in the place you live. So try to balance your answers to the questions asked.

Nevertheless, well done!</div>
