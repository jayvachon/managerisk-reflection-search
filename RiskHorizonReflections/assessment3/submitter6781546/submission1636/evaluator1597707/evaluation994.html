    <div class="field-value">I donâ€™t see any key strength of this reflection because the main aim of the assignment was ignored which is to apply the main dimensions of risk management on the game 

A lot of things would make this reflection better , one of them is to read more about the risk management concept  and the role of knowledge, protection and insurance in a successful development and risk management , since he skipped answering many  questions in the assignment which led to poor illustration and missing many points that should have been mentioned </div>
