    <div class="field-value">This reflection was very close to the feeling for the people in the communities, and not so much theoretical. I think the writer succeeded in the game because he/she focussed on the this quality rather than strategising coldly. Clearly, he/she did better than me!

The reflection might have referred to a course model as a framework, but this would have taken the heart out of it. Essentially, risk management is about people and how they behave in extreme circumstances. I think the writer articulated his/her understanding of this.</div>
