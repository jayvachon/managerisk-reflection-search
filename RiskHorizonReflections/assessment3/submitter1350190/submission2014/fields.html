    <h1>Submission 2014 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1350190, session_user_id: 895abc30add6c9ac50822e80536f5d85e5a1979d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management game combined situations of an economy needing to build up it's infrastructure while gaining knowledge about the environment. It was, at times, a tricky balance knowing when to build-out the community versus research a potentially catastrophic event. <br /><br />One of the ways I chose to mitigate risk was by always purchasing the highest quality insurance at the start of each new level of the game. Though sometimes expensive, it allowed me to focus my time on knowledge and protection. By allocating insurance funds at the start of the level I didn't have to spend my time worrying about whether my properties would be destroyed/ critically damaged when the next comet hit because if they were I would have the funds to repair.<br /><br />The first few times that I played the game I didn't research the incoming comets. Once I understood how important the research portion of the game was I was able to maximize my research time based on the severity/ chance of hit.  <br /><br />I live in a flat area of the United States. The region sees many tornadoes, often occurring spontaneously, providing little time to react. Our community has installed warning sirens. When the siren sounds, everyone makes their way to the basement. This, in some ways, represents the protection bar. The largest differences here would be damage faced based on infrastructural damage versus the damage a community would face with human fatalities. Luckily, the game doesn't try and quantify these things -- providing a simpler "percentage damaged" statistic. This is where the game and reality heavily differ. A risk manager, in any part of the world, will have many more complex factors to consider when identifying risk management strategy's.  <br /><br />The game also allowed for infrastructural development. Though not mentioned, this may signify the development of technology, health care, education etc. A community that is developing may be able to get to a point of specialization thus, allowing for faster research, better transfer of knowledge/ protection, and a generally more streamlined ability to grow. This wasn't well represented in the game. Both, knowledge and protection, grew at the same rate from level 1 through level 6. This, of course was an oversight needed for simplicities sack but, may actually play in the favor of reality. By creating this simplified world we have been able to further understand the need for balance, to combine the need to develop infrastructure while also mitigating risk.<br /></div>
