    <h1>Submission 1359 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3991105, session_user_id: 382f9bbac5f58688aa13c40f75e212229dab1c77)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>As it was discussed in the first two weeks of the course;
risk management is about three main disciplines information, protection and insurance.<br /></span><span>
Risk management is the main player in this game. As coping with the risk of the
flying meteoroids that hits the ocean and cause floods as a reality that will
happen anyway and the only thing that i can do with this is to cope with it and
trying to decrease its loses by collecting information about it and making protection
for the pods in accordance to the severity and the chance of hitting of the
meteoroids and finally insuring the built pods for recovery after the flood. <br /></span><span>
As a decision maker I don’t have all the resources in time as I need it so I have
to make some trade-offs between choices to survive. To collect information
about the meteoroids it means that I will consume time from my development and
protecting process. By developing the pods I am consuming money may be at the expense
of protecting the already built pods. Also protecting is consuming money and
time at the expense of information and insurance. Also paying for insurance
will affect the availability of money for development and protection.<br /></span><span><span>
I have played this game several times. The first time I was concerned about the
development and insurance and never looked for the protection or information. Which
caused that the meteoroids was affecting my pods severe effects as there was no
protection. Then in the following games I started to make protection but just
by luck because I haven’t collected information about the risk of the
meteoroids and its severity and chance to hit me. So it was a loss of money on unneeded
overwhelmed protection on the expense of developing. At last I have learned
that I should manage using the three main disciplines simultaneously in
accordance to each other. As the protection will be according to the severity and
the insurance will be according to the chance to hit. Focusing in one process
and ignoring the others will make me lose the game. <br /></span><span>
May be if I am a developer of this game I will add a feature that will allow
players to downgrade the pods to gain money and protection. As in some
situations in real life we have to take a decisions that is apparently a losses
but on the long term it will save another things and as said a less loose
better than a huge disaster. this is considered as a risk of losing something you own at the expense of something u will get in the future. For example in the very cold areas people may sell
a chair or a TV to buy a heavy cloth or upgrade their shelter to save their lives from dying iced. </span></span></p></div>
