    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><div><div><div>As an anti – computer game player, I must say that I found this game<br />particularly funny and entertaining (even though it got blocked a<br />couple of times :)). What I liked most about it is that it made me<br />think continuously and forced me into finding equilibrated strategies<br />and solutions for limit situations, when more options are available<br />and resources are limited (both time and money). And this is mostly<br />what risk management is about.<br />In terms of preparation, I mainly concentrated on knowledge (research)<br />and one protection measure (raising the isle) and this was generally<br />the most important trade-off I did during the game, every time I<br />played. Nevertheless, while sometimes I neglected constant development<br />concentrating more on insurance to diminish the loss, I found that<br />upgrading the pods seemed to make them more resistant and increase the<br />overall financial resources. Thus, sometimes I chose to diminish the<br />investment in insurance and use the available resources for the<br />development of the world.<br />In the short run, it was obvious that raising the island (protection)<br />would diminish the power of each impact. Then, continuous investment<br />in research helped a lot in loss reduction (through community help –<br />if you are trained to do the connections fast enough:)) after each<br />impact. I noticed that the better one manages to prepare for the risk<br />(through knowledge, protection and insurance) and cope with it<br />(community help after the hits), the smaller losses were and the more<br />financial resources one saved to develop the managed world (build and<br />upgrade pods).<br />I played the game three times. The best option at the end proved to be<br />constantly investing in the research, then balance the remaining<br />resources between insurance (I decided to choose for the middle<br />option, after many variations), the constant development of the pods<br />(which increased the total financial resources – I had neglected this<br />part at the beginning) and raising the isle to diminish the power of<br />the comet hits.<br />What I found particularly interesting at the game was the move from a<br />non existent to a developed world (going through the development<br />phase, as well). Investment in the pods (through construction and<br />upgrading) increased the financial resources and, at the same time,<br />the costs of other services (such as insurance, which was directly<br />related to the values we had to insure). Nevertheless, it also proved<br />to be more resistant to shocks, as well. What I would add is the<br />communication of knowledge (many times, knowledge is not disseminated<br />correctly or through the correct and trustworthy resources). Research<br />is not sufficient if people do not know about its results and impacts.<div></div></div></div><div></div></div><div></div></div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div>
