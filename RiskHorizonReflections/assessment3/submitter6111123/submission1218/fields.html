    <h1>Submission 1218 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6111123, session_user_id: d75910cd9827d9d2d0ca48381f75a637203cbee1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk in the management of the
game, conditions the advance in the development because we always have the
possibility of being hit by an asteroid. This situation is present during the
whole game and we have to face it through the different options the game gives
us. In this sense, I had to choose between developing quickly or invest a
little in protection, knowledge and  insurance. More concretely, I also need to
choose among these last three options because I did not have infinite budget.
In this sense, it was a little difficult for me what to select in terms of its
importance, because on the one hand an insurance is good to cover part of
future events, but on the other hand we are not sure if these events are going
to happen. So in my case I gave a little more importance to knowledge and
protection, what entailed to expend more money and time on that two options.</p>

<p>And of course, the investment on
insurance, protection or knowledge to prepare for risk (in terms of money and
time) has an influence in the level of development of the colony, meaning that
its grow will not be so quickly. However, that should not be a problem if we
are not in a competition among colonies or countries to see which one develops
more quickly.</p>

<p>It is true that human nature most
of the time want quick results without thinking in the future generations or in
the most vulnerable people, so probably If I had to play it only once, my
option would have been to try to build as much pods as possible to grow more
and more, but as we saw in the game, that hardly ever happens because other
factors, as risk, are present. However if had more than one opportunity to play
the game I would have tried to play it in different ways to see what finally is
the best option to reach the highest level. </p>

<p>One of the things that I learnt in
this sense, is that in real life, we, governments or decision makers have only
one opportunity of election and that must be the correct one if we do not want
to have losses in terms of human lives, economic resources and development.</p>

<p>Finally, ane change that maybe I would
make, or to be more exact, one more factor that I would add according to the
reality that face many countries, and the one in which I am, is for example the
obstacles that many countries have to be able to develop themselves in the way
they want. In this sense, and as an obstacle as the asteroids, I should add the
payment of the external debt that many countries have to do and that sometimes
is unfair and illegitimate because was contracted under dictatorship or under
draconian conditions imposed by developed countries. That, of course, is an
obstacle to their development, investment in knowledge, prevention or even
insurance. In the game, that should be as another kind of comet that from
time to time (for example once a year or once a semester) hits the country and
damage its infrastructure (pods). </p></div>
