    <h1>Submission 676 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4589883, session_user_id: 692fbba5218db70f64ebd6cc8c1dbe3e52e0ec2f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>1. a) The role of risk management in the Risk
Horizon game was to act as the central agent for the community of Alora by proactively
overseeing and employing a risk management structure for the community in minimizing
and/or preventing the damage/destruction (physical/monetary loss) in the development
of the community due to meteors and resultant destructive waves (a systemic,
natural or external shock), in conjunction to, increasing community development through
the use of processes by which, risk decisions were made given prevailing
environment conditions (coastal community) and available funds an<span>d pr</span>escribing and implementing
actions, ie., preparedness (acquiring knowledge and making judgements on
the meteors – severity of damage and likelihood of collision with the island
and/or destructive waves, obtaining protection – financial cost of elevating
the island, and employing the use of insurance – to lessen the financial loss
due to damage) to deal with the coping state inherent with the perceived
(uncertain) meteors’ degree of risk (destruction and financial loss) and
Alora’s physical environment.   </p><p>b) Several
combinations, choices or trade-offs were made to find a successful (achieving
next level in game) balance between developing Alora rapidly or more measured
growth and taking various levels of apt preparedness, ie, obtaining knowledge/research
on the meteors, incurring financial cost to elevate the island dependent upon
the severity and likelihood of collision and as well, varying the levels of
insurance dependent again on the severity and likelihood of damage due to the
meteors. In gaining knowledge from the meteors, we attempted to insure
appropriately against the higher registering meteors in severity and likelihood
of collision and as well attempted to take an adequate measure in preparedness
by spending funds to increase the level of the island with the intent to
protect from waves resulting from the meteors however, despite “pressing and
holding” the slider to increase or raise the island we were unsuccessful on the
whole from using this “tool” of preparedness as repeated “pressing and holding”
failed to register any change on the meter. After numerous replays of the game,
only once were we successful in moving to the second level and this was almost
totally due to being “lucky” with meteors that were either very low in severity and/or
likelihood of collision.</p><p> c) Preparation
for risk (meteor research, obtaining protection - raising the island and obtaining insurance) affected development by not only using necessary funds for development
but also using more of the critical time units.  </p><p>2. a) As mentioned, the game was played
numerous times in an attempt to earn the next level. After the first play of
the game, we found that making use of repeated observations ie., gaining knowledge on the
meteors provided us with the biggest edge albeit still limiting our overall end success. </p><p>b) <span>The main things learned from the game was to
develop the community in measured stages, to take repeated observations of the meteors to
gain knowledge and learn of their possible negative or “shock” values and with
gaining that information, to make use of the appropriate level of insurance as well as attempting
to make use of the other preparedness factor, raising the island, in order to
assist in the offset of damage and loss to the community. </span></p><p></p><span></span><p>

</p><p>3. a) One factor that I might add to a
revision of the game would be to provide knowledge of the culture’s aversion to
risk ie, a utility function which entail providing information on demographics
and economic factors. Adding this factor would provide another dimension and
may limit a more risky approach to the game. </p><p>As an aside, I tried playing this
game using different internet service providers seeking to see if a difference could
be discerned in the effectiveness of the “slider” and its corresponding
registering in raising of the island but no difference was found. I found that
evident notification of funds being used by this factor, the gauge did not
respond to or register any increase regardless of the amount of funds
expended.    </p><p><span>
