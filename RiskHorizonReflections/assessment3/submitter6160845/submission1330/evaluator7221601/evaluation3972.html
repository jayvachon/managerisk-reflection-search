    <div class="field-value">The reflection describes very well the risk management options presented in the game. It also makes an excellent suggestion to improve the game by adding another level where the government could interfere as well. Probably reflecting more on what was learnt from the game rather than extensively explaining the game would be more valuable. Overall, it is an excellent reflection.</div>
