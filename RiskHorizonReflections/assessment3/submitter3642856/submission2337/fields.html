    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? <br /><br /><strong>In what ways did risk Affect preparation for development (Immediately, or after some time)? 


Risk management is a key to succeed and advance in levels and adequately resourced paper. In many cases I had to keep the balance of action and vision for the future with respect to knowledge, protection and insurance. The management of risk in Christic affect materially and development as you advance in the game levels. </strong><br /><br /> 2 
If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What Were the main things you learned from the game?
<br /><br /><div><strong>What I did was try to control different resources equitably and plan to make the point out insurance abstaining some growth to be controlled and protected the development of each area. </strong><br /><br /></div><div><strong>What I learned was that the game should primarily be a balance between each activity to have a good overview of possibilities and contingencies so as to react appropriately in the event of a major event inevtitable magnitude. </strong></div><br /> 3 
The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with develop developing a new version of the game, que Allows you to change or add one single thing. What change would you propose to better risk management Represent the choices that matter in the place you live? <br /><br /><strong> Add indicators more detailed time in the progress of the research function with an indicator in seconds for each line of advance, just as with the flag raising developing areas, so others do not think it would make major adjustments in the same.</strong></div>
