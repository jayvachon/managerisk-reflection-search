    <h1>Submission 1055 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8303859, session_user_id: 3fef60139ac7fb6ba730ad81c62e90badade25b6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In my opinion, the game Risk Horizon was a pretty impressive way of
imparting awareness of what risk management is and how critical it is, in order
for development to take place. Risk management in the game was basically about alertness
of incoming obstacles (through research), providing security (by investing in
insurance) when disasters hit and preventing damage (by acquiring protection)
to avoid the risk. I played the game more than once and overtime I was able to
work out and prioritise what needed to be done at different stages of the level.</p><p> In every game I played, I made sure I purchased insurance. There
really was no question with regard to investing in insurance. It was a
cost-effective approach that would benefit the development process throughout
the level and towards managing the risk made by the comet strike. In the long
run I saved more money by investing in insurance than I would have had I not. I
would have spent more money paying all the damage costs, on my own. When
deciding how much protection to acquire, my decision was heavily dependent on
the data, through research, that indicated the severity and probability of the comet
hitting. I also depended on research greatly because acquiring protection
halted development from taking place so I needed to establish whether or not it
was worth the shot and also whether it was very necessary.</p>

<p>Some of the main things I learnt from the game are:</p>

<p> <span><span>Ø 
</span>Research is a very important aspect of risk management
and plays a very critical role in helping determine what measure of risk
management should be taken at different stages of risk management and how much of it should be
taken. Of course this is greatly dependent on its severity and the probability of the crisis hitting revealed through data collected by research.
This not only allows recovery after the disaster or prevention of risk taking place but it also saves
money and time.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Ø  </span>A
preventative measure such as acquiring protection is a good approach to take
because it avoids damages and the devastating effect of crisis. However it 
halts (even prevents) development and as stated throughout the course, certain risks must be
taken to allow change and development. Protection therefore should only be
acquired when absolutely necessary and when the severity and chances of the
disaster hitting is very high.</span></p>

<p><span><span>Ø 
</span>It is always wise to invest in insurance to
provide a cushion of security especially in terms of funding towards recovery
after adversity, if preventative measures fail. Investment in insurance is a
long-term commitment thus decision of how much money should be spent on it
should be based also on information acquired through research.</span></p><p><span></span>If there was one way I could improve the game that would be through
changing the bar representing protection and replacing it with a notification
icon that states how much protection has been acquired, in figures
(percentage). That would be a more efficient way of indicating to the gamer how
much has been acquired. Otherwise, playing Risk Horizon helped me visualize
everything I have been learning throughout the course and helped me analyse certain
aspects of it. It helped me understand how important it is to prioritise the different risk management approaches and consider the impact they would have on development process. When I finally got myself engrossed in the game, I also understood the importance of time management factor in the entire processes of both development and risk management. Every decision made was just as important as another, and in one way or another it affected each one</p><span>
