    <div class="field-value">short and concise work, I like it. The author understood the game but I think he/she should think more about necessarity or in authour's opinion uncessarity of insurance. However it is very instresting point of view - to manage the risk without "expensive" (according to what?) insurance? ;) I also would hear more about it and sustain development from the author btw. I really like DE! Greetings from PL :D</div>
