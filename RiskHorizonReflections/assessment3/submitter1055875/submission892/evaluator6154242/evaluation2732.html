    <div class="field-value">The reflection mostly centered on the game played , and not on the inferences gained out of it . The game is aimed at providing more information about risk and opportunity . I don't agree with the view that taking insurance of 75% would mitigate the risk. Insurance is necessary a boon for risk mitigation but too much dependent on insurance would not yield good result. Even in certain cases 33% of insurance would mitigate the risk.. Insurance would compensate the loss , but too much investment in insurance would create paucity of funds for other activities , and would not allow you to allot funds for research and development which is crucial in such cases as natural calamities and disasters. </div>
