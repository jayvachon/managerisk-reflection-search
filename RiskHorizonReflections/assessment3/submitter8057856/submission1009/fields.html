    <h1>Submission 1009 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8057856, session_user_id: 6b15a352d15bdb6e12542b21e109be79e835b12d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management played a very pivotal role to the overall development of the pods as well as the community. I had to make decisions very quickly and i found that the time in between hits also helped me catch y breath and plot my next moves. I also had to strike a balance between development and research.  The more time i spent developing my pods, the less time i spent in research and the more unprepared i was when a meteor hit.  I also appreciated that other than information that i got from research, i was also was rewarded by being given money too.  I made decisions to build or develop less when i saw double meteors as the severity of the damage would be more. I would make sure i was covered by insurance or up my insurance during this time as well so as to be covered in case of a hit.  I also chose to keep my reserves up instead of raising the island levels during this time.  <br /><br />I played the game more than 20 times as i was determined to move past level 1.  I found that with each new round, i learnt something new and valuable that allowed me to move an inch closer to the next round. I found the information after each round loss was very useful such as amount of insurance paid out as well as tips to handle the next round of attacks. I also learnt that as much as development was crucial, safety and research were more important. Another lesson came in the form of the sooner i spotted the meteors, the longer preparation and research time i had. After many attacks, i learnt to speed up the development during the time there were no comets or comets with less severity. <br /><br />I live in a place where not only one type of risk exist, but many.  Having to only look out for one type of risk is not realistic. Most times a lot of people are juggling multiple types of risk such as drought, job loss and disease. I would add a few more types of risk such as war from a different island, food shortages on my island to enable people to learn to balance the risks and decisions made in a more realistic setting. Above all, i would also add as much information as possible on the attacks. </div>
