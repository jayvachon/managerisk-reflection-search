    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">I reached level 5 after several
attempts, here is what i learned from this gameÂ :</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">- The role of the game is to better
understand the different components of risk management (knowledge,
protection and insurance) and the way they interact. Since the game
provide you with only limited resources for your development you have
to balance between the different component. The preparation for risk
has a direct effect : decreasing your financial resources and a long
term effect</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">-  providing information to make
appropriate choice ( knowledge),</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">- protecting your development and
decreasing impact (protection)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">- helping you to cope with the impact
(insurance)</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;"><br /></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">- After the first attempt, I realized
that you can not protect yourself against all risks (it cost to much
time and resources to have a full protection so being insure is a
must,</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">Nevertheless protection is very useful
and you can not be insure for everything without lowering the number
of impact without damage in addition some of the protection you
establish in one level can be kept for the next level,  finally
knowledge help you make the appropriate mix between investment (new
plot, and protection). 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;"><br /></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0cm;">- If I had to add simple elements to
the game I will add the behavior element, by adding a population (how
much to you educate them, how to you manage them ( evacuation for
example- cost money but save life and you don't have to educate them
again)</p></div>
