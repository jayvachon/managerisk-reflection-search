    <div class="field-value">The account is clearly articulated, and touches on all the important aspects that were to be learned from the game. The author clearly explained what role risk management played in the success of playing the game and how he/she had to balance knowledge, protection, insurance and making the important development needed in Alora. A list of what would be added in the game was included. I think the author did a remarkable job as per the assignment's  requirements.</div>
