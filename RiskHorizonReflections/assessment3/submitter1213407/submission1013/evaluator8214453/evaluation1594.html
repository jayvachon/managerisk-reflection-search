    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection lies in a comprehensive explanation of how this person perceived the role of risk management in this game and how this person changed playing strategy in the course of the game. Also, this person is very strong in reflecting and then connecting different elements of risk management. Therefore, I think, this game helped this person to through reflection really comprehend what risk management in development context is. In my belief, this reflection is complete and it would be difficult to make it better. Congratulations!</div>
