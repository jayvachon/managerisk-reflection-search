    <h1>Submission 1206 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7015421, session_user_id: 3ccf76f84978baab0bd5e74ec794c1f2209ac2c3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) The role of risk
management in the game was to evaluate the danger of incoming comets and
attempt to mitigate the impact of comets
while still maintaining forward development momentum.  The comets represented negative shocks or 'changes in the world' that
varied in strength, likelihood and timing. Research represented greater
knowledge allowing for better preparation. Insurance policies represented the
transfer of resources from safe times and states to cover need and the protection button
represented the expenditure of resources on preparing for dangers. <br /><p>Initially, I prioritised
keeping my station at a higher level of preparation than the danger threatened
by incoming comets. Using this strategy, I did not need insurance to redistribute
resources as protection and coping was sufficient for the shock. This strategy
generally increased resilience, but development was limited and I was eventually
unable to reach the goal. This was a ‘cautious’ approach to risk management and
was liable to result in ‘stagnation' or 'loss aversion'. Preparation reduced
development immediately, as the resources were diverted. It
increased over time, but it meant that time and resources that could
have been applied to development had already been expended, even when the level
of risk turned out to have been less than first thought.</p><p>2) In subsequent attempts,
I was less cautious, focusing my attention on better awareness of risks with
high likelihood and severity. The drawback was occasional unexpected shocks. I
minimised unavoidable shocks by carefully using insurance to mitigate large numbers of high severity, high chance comets to avoid crisis. </p><p>I learnt that focusing on research to judge the most significant, high chance impacts and regularly using protection
was the best course to maintain development and was preferable to a combination of high levels of insurance and ‘coping’. The timing and regularity of shocks can result in 'crisis', so reducing uncertainty through knowledge can reduce vulnerability and allow or a wise allocation of limited resources.</p><p>3) In terms of changes to the game, I would add a random ‘purchase’
of either insurance, an amount spent on protection or ‘greying out’ an option
for a period of time either after multiple comets strikes or during long
periods of inactivity. This would represent problems for risk management
associated with public opinion driving action and expenditure. For example, in
Australia, government refuses to take action on climate change despite research
and expert opinion. </p><p> </p></div>
