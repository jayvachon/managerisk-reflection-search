    <div class="field-value">Better understanding of the game is the strength of this reflection. The student is well acquainted with the game. Another strength is how the student related the game experience to that of a possibility of  Earthquake/ Tsunami of a greater magnitude in North America. It becomes more practical.

One thing I noticed in the reflection that, when corrected, will make this reflection better is the Spelling Mistake. I think the right word the student intended is '' Population" and not "Popular". Had the student spelled the word correctly, it would have been a strong point.
