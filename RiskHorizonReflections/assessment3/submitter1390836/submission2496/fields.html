    <h1>Submission 2496 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1390836, session_user_id: a34ac5e159aad0bb1dd1f8a055d3b701558d704f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">First of all, for playing this game, the experience from different browsers may already be a strategy for risk management. In Chrome,Â the protection building always limits at a low level and the research on meteors are also extremely slow. Therefore, the game is very bad in gaming experience and it shows the relevant knowledge importance. After switching to Firefox, I won all levels after level 6. The knowledge is a necessary part for playing this game.<br /><br />This game has to develop the pods and take care about the meteors. In general, my strategy is on the development of pods, the research on dangerous meteors and the protection building. Since repairing needs a lot of time, buying insurance to shift some burdens is useless. In this game, we can understand that prevention is better than cure. Having knowledge on the risks and enough protection is important, but we also have to put a balance on developing the pods. Protection building and having knowledge for checking some serious catastrophes is for the long term effect, especially after each target level is met. Buying insurance is only a short-term medicine, it cannot solve most problems except in the first level.<br /><br /><br />In the first level, I try to focus on the creating all pods first and take an eye on every meteors. Since every meteors are checked and researched according to the probability of severity of causing damages and the effect of the damages, most situations are already under control. When facing the extreme situation of deadly damages with very high probability, if the protection building is not high enough to cover, then taking insurance is the only last resort, as repairing after damages needs a lot of time. I have played more than once, but the strategy is nearly the same, except using different browsers. It always matches the idiom, "Prevention is always better than cure" or " It is no use crying over split milk".<br /><br />If the new version allows, I will suggest that more lands should be added. Putting all pods in a place is an extremely dangerous act, and distributing the pods into different lands will make the risk even less. The probability of the catastrophes across all different lands is much smaller than on a particular land. It is also the diversification that is always proposed in financial markets. Maybe another idiom will be met after this new change, "Don't put all eggs in a basket".<br /><br /><br /></div>
