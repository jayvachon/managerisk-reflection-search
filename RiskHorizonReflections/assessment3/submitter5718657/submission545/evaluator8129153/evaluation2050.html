    <div class="field-value">Key strength of this reflection is its emphasis on the development while giving the community enough protection against potential threats.
I think this reflection has made a very little effort to correlate with the real world. The reflection would have been considerably better, if it had mentioned its learnings from the game and was able to relate them with the general risk management rather than the details about the game. </div>
