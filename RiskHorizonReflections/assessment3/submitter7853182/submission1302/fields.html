    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk Horizon teaches us what risk management is
like in the real world; albeit with an element of fantasy in it to make it more
lively and appealing.</p>

<p>The role of risk management that we had to face was
essentially a trade-off. The three aspects of Knowledge, Protection and
Insurance had to be balanced in such a way that Alura had enough resources for
development too. The fundamental role was that of balancing everything, as further
explained:<br /><br />
Knowledge: Knowing your risk is vital so as to be prepared for the impending
risk and face it without incurring any sort of loss. In Risk Horizon though, I
learnt that if you spend too much time solely focusing on gaining knowledge
(Research) by watching the meteors, you will lose out on precious time which
can be spent on development or creation of new opportunities. Knowing your risk
is important, and so is bracing yourself to face the same; but being too
engrossed in it will be of little use. At the end of the day, it is essential
that you balance your preparation with healthy and holistic development.<br />
Another aspect is knowing if the risk is sever enough to protect against.
Sometimes an impending risk may not really affect you much; in which case
researching or preparing against it will prove a mere waste of valuable time as
well as resources.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Protection: After knowledge, comes protection. Here we again
face a trade-off, whether to develop or to protect. Either way, our resources
are being used and so is our time. But should we really devote so much into
protecting that we hinder our own progress? Striking the right balance is what
Risk Horizon, and indeed the concept of Risk Management teaches us. In the
game, if the comet’s severity wasn’t too high, extreme levels of expensive
protection wasn’t needed. If the severity of the risk is too high or if the
risk is such that no protection can be sought, there exists two possible
solutions – building connections and insurance. The latter will be further
explained, while the former concept is essentially a way of ensuring that no
risk leaves us shorthanded. It is merely another way of preparing for any risk.
By building connections, you can ensure that no matter how severe the risk hits
you, there’s always a way out. Development is easier when such connections are
in existence.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Insurance: There are many risks against which you simply
cannot protect yourself with no matter what. These risks will leave you at a
loss and cannot be prevented or even foreseen. For such times, there is insurance.
Insurance may be defined as the act of valuing a risk and shifting the element
of risk to an insurer who will be taking the risk at a premium paid by the
customer. Insurance helps people to better deal with risks. The nature of risks
means that the chance of that risk occurring is fluctuating, which benefits the
insurers and the insured as well. But depending on insurance is also not a
viable option, there always needs to be a balance between this and the
aforementioned elements.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>As indicated above, the main things I learnt from the game
are why striking a balance is important in order for risk to be managed and
development to continue, and how one can strike such a balance. The first time
was a little intimidating as balancing the various aspects of risk management
seemed a bit daunting, but as I gave it a few more tries, I understood the
concept better eventually just missing out on level 4.</p>
