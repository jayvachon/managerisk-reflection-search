    <div class="field-value">This reflection is very well organized. It appears that great thought was put into the organization of their thoughts in order to share their experience.
A more personal tone, rather than a strictly academic tone, would make this a more enjoyable read. After all, the first goal of writing is to engage the reader. Excellent job for academics. Could be better for the web and the modern digital sharing age.</div>
