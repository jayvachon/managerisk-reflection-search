    <h1>Submission 1897 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 64447, session_user_id: 471a43b16f41a97d9a985eb7056a241b370fb103)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>1.       </span>Effectively risk management plays a
very important role in the game, my choice was not effectively evaluate the
impact of risks and overprotect against risks to insurance, when the most
effective way was preparing against risks without losing sight of insurance
against them.</p>

<p><span>2.       </span>I've played twice and the result was
the same level 1. The second time I took into account the risks rather than
insurance against them, and I focus more on the power of research rather than
the power of protection and insurance. What I learned is that there must be a
trade-off between the three powers, but most notably in the assessment and
investigation of risks.</p><p>3.        The game is well thought out but
so you can include all the casuistic could include as somehow manage risk and /
or evaluate these risks and their impact affecting the development of the
community, my community does not affect both natural hazards but if other
systemic risks such as financial or geostrategic type, which have not been seen
in other levels of the game.</p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>It was a great experience that I would like to have improved. Thank you
very much.</span></p></div>
