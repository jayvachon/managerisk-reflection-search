    <div class="field-value">This reflection explain very clearly what the role of risk management is on the game, this being the point I consider to be the strength of the analysis.

 I believe that the reflection could have better developed on the missing points of the game, and how that relates to her/his country of residence. Additionally, clarity is not all that evident in the second paragraph in which the player explains the steps taken to ameliorate in the game.</div>
