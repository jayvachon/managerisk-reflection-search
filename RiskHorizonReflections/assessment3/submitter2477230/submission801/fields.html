    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. What was the role of risk management # 

That was a fantastic example how we can mange a risk. However I met some limitations - e.g. some words were difficult to understand in Enlglish, therefore the very first trial of playing the game was the most difficult. In order to manfe teh risk I neede to recognize how aprtucular decisions were imopacting the outcome - therefore I sterted to make an insurance at the lowest level, then increased to the highest. LAso it was necessary to test an impact of protection and the knowledge - trsying to identify a difference between : before protection and with protection. Knowledge management process was the latest which was tested.    
So,  a proper  preparation to risk in the second session did let to manage the game more effectively with better scoring. For sure some time was needed to know interactions of all methods of risk management.

2. Alternatively, if you played the game more than once #

Playing a second time - the conclusion was that I needed to spend mopre time on preparation in order to undesrtand all implications - and interrelations. I did try to make a model 'what if' and to etimate an effectivenes of perticual decisions on the final result. So the main points were:
a - better preparation thruogh better undesrtanding of the instruction 
b - obtain insurance, which helps to rebuild pods damaged from flooding much quicker and cheaper,
the fact is taht it recovers lost development.reconstruction time after pods were repaired! 
c - better - in more details analyze - the other: protection and knowledge 
the main learning was - I ned to find an optimal balnce bewteen all 3 items and that is taking time = learning by doing mistakes 

3. The game captures, in a simplified way #

a - that would be a automatic translation in other languages  
b - knowledge collection space - type of data bese - a place where I could accumulate a knowledge reated to impact of particular decisions related to risk mitigation / protection 
c - automatic presentaion of resuts which are condequences of taking particular decisions in dimensions - cost, time , savings , efficiency -&gt; unit USD / or time saving to expense, 
d -  visaul pesentation of learnings - ro confirm the learning curve 
e - make the game more flexible - for diferent diffucluties level which could be chosen by the player 0 for the training purpose 
f - provide with an ability to construct own game - based on a given scenarios - up to the payer decision
g - make a simpler version - for kids
