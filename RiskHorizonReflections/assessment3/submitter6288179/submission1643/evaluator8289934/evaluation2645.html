I agree with you that at first we should pay attention to increasing the ability of self-protection, and growth of the community (building news or upgrading) when there's no risk or risk at low level. When risks occur, we will have to research and calculate quickly the extent of damage. Due to budget restrictions, we have to consider whether how much money for building, upgrading, how much for protection or buying  insurance, and researching in the development process. 
A small suggestion, you should express more clearly the roles of research, protection and insurance, then the relationship between them in order to get a sustainable community development.</div>
