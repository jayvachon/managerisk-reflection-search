    <div class="field-value">question 1:the student clearly understood the role of risk management after playing the game and could simply explain this using relevant examples from the game
question 2:on answering the third question,on the improvements that should be made on the game,the student seems fixeted on what they learnt in class instead of pointing out a concept that would simply enhance  the game for all users irrespective of whether they are doing the risk and opportunity course or not.
