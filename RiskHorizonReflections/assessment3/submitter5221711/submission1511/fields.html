    <h1>Submission 1511 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5221711, session_user_id: 6312c3dfe9e3a8609ed3b27b1a9c48737436ead8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I had to manage risk, between pace of development, protection, and insurance levels.  I learned that protection often provided more value at offsetting risk than insurance.   But as my development became more established, I had to also bump up my insurance coverage.  Sometimes I became too engaged in the protection side, at the loss of development.   Quite an addictive game.   Interestingly, I found this exercise to be applicable to my business as well.   We are in the infrastructure design and construction business and constantly need to manage risk vs reward.  Sometimes our attorneys and insurance folks go overboard with respect to the protection aspects and stymie our growth and revenue.   <br /><br />What did I do differently after the first time?  Initially I did not understand I needed to repurchase insurance between levels, so after the first turn I always made certain to cover this aspect.<br /><br />What changes would I propose?  Adding option to pay for Interconnection infrastructure between the pods before disaster hits ( instead of after ).</div>
