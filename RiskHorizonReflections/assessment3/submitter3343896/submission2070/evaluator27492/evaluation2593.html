    <div class="field-value">The writer definitely understands that there are important economic tradeoffs that are critical for managing risk while protecting growth.   I also like the suggestion of increasing the variety of risks faced by a manager to make the game more realistic.  One thing that would make this reflection better would be to improve the clarity and organization of the response to show that the assignment was clearly understood. </div>
