    <div class="field-value">The main strength of this reflection is its firm analysis of what risk is and the steps necessary to address it. Furthermore the writer elaborates wonderfully upon their own personal strategy and implications for the game. The one weakness I could find was that the author didn't elaborate on the second question but other than that it is complete. </div>
