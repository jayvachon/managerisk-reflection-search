    <h1>Submission 641 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1232748, session_user_id: 02805c66403d769a9653856753316dfe31533fc7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><a><span>This game is about
finding the right balance between spending resources on development and
spending resources to protect the development using risk management tools
provided on the game. There are three way to manage risk  on this game (1) The Power of Research
(2)The  Power to Protection (3) The Power
of Insurance. Timing also play a critical part in the game as recourses are accumulated
with time and development also took time to complete. Power of research and
Power of protection also took time and resources.</span></a></p><p><span>At my
first try, I used all three methods and realized that cost of Insurance
increase rapidly as I progress to higher levels; however cost of The Power of
Research and The Power of Protection remain same and low compare to cost of
insurance.  Maximum insurance coverage
available is 50% of loss thus this risk management option is may not very
effective. On my second attempt, I only used The Power of Research and The
Power of Protection risk management method. It turned out that these two risk
management methods are far less expensive and able to protect the pods 100% of
times from any damage caused by meteoroid. By employing these two risk management,
I won all four levels.  It appear, that
one could win all four levels just with The Power of Protection; If I were to play
the game again, I will try the play the game with only The Power of The Protection
risk management to test my hypothesis. </span></p><p>



</p><p><span>Present
version of game while capture the essence of risk management, it may be too simplified
from real life risk management problems. In the present version of game, there
is only one type of risk (Meteoroids).  In
real life, almost all the situation has multiple types of risks and managing
one risk effectively adversely affect management of other risks.  In the current version, only risk management choices
user makes is that how much of each of risk management tools to use. It would
be more realistic if game also offers multiple types of risks. I only used  “The Power of Research” and “The  Power to Protection” risk management options
and able to avoid any losses during my 4 level of game. I believe this is not a
realistic as in real world no risk management tool offer 100% protection.  I believe that this game could be future
enhanced by introducing multiple types of risks and making no risk management tool
offer 100% protection. </span></p></div>
