    <h1>Submission 2108 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4593145, session_user_id: 8406641c813b623238987dcb34547bc3d472079f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Risk Horizon is a very
interesting and well developed interactive game, even my nephew of 9 years like
it, and he was very interested of playing it. The role of risk management was
crucial at the game; shown risk as the meteorites was a good analogy to real
life where the analysis (research) is very important to have better information
of the possible risk, its impact (severity) and possible consequences. We must
find equilibrium of the resources destiny to knowledge, protection and
insurance. In the game preparation for risk affect almost immediately to the
level of development, in real life it could take more time but its importance
is undeniable.  The main thing I have
learned of playing the game is that future is unknown so we must prepare the
most to it, doing research of the develop of the circumstances (in this case of
risk and opportunities situation), learning from before (like making mistakes
involved in the experience of playing the game like building unnecessary pod or
desperate on evolution) and developing knowledge (practical and theoretical)
which helps facing different types of risk situations. Finally if I’m asked to
add something to better represent the risk management in real life to the game,
I would try to add something that represents the resources imply into
development, like labor, land, technology and capital involved in the creation
of the pots: Where are these resources take of? How much do we have of them? And
what are the chances of use them properly?</span></p><p><br /></p></div>
