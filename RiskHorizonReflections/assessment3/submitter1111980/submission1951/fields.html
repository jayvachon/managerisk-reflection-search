    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I must admit the game was quite a struggle for
me. I am not sure if there was some technical problem on my side, but I was not
able to visibly profit from the community connection minigame. I was clicking
and connecting the highlighted buildings, but there was no indication that I
would be doing it right and even though I tried to click on them and connect them,
I was still receiving very high damage. Similarly, I was frustrated from getting
protection. I do not know whether it was intentional, but it was charging
incredibly slowly and no matter how long I was holding the button up, I was not
able to charge it more than to the first bar. Like this, even after over 7
attempts, I was not able to make it over the second round, where I was
struggling with excessive damages and lack of wealth.</p>

<p><span>Let’s describe now shortly how I have
approached the game. Of course, the basis was to build the buildings and get
some insurance in order to make reparation cheaper. The higher the insurance
the better, however in the second round, there was less resources available so
in most cases, I ended up with 50% insurance. I tried to build some protection,
which seemed important at the beginning, but as I was not able to charge the
bar significantly, it played a less significant role in the later stages of the
game for me.  When the meteorites started
approaching, I tried to research each of them at least to a certain manner. The
higher the chance to hit and the higher its destructive power, the more I tried
to research them. Each of them thus got at least a bit of attention, as first
it seems the community help might be important (even thought later it proved to
be practically useless). Only in the case of very low probability of a hit, I
rather invested the time to building protection and repairing the damaged
buildings from previous hits. </span></p>

<p>All in all, it is difficult to make any conclusions
from the game, as I am not sure if I got it right/ it was working right. However,
I learned that in order to win, one had to combine all the tools he had and
consider the probability of the risk. When there were no resources for
protection or costly new constructions, it was better to invest your time in free
research leading to (in this case useless) community help = invest in the least
costly and most easily obtainable tool. Protection might have helped, but it
was not efficient, as it took a lot of time to obtain it and the results were disappointing.
Insurance was for sure useful, however, in some situations, it was more useful
to obtain a cheaper one rather than wait for sufficient resources.</p>
