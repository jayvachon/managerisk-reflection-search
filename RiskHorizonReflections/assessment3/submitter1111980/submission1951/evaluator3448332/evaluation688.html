    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that although the student was not sure if he/she got the game right or if it was working correctly, he/she was able to see the purpose of the game which was to create a balance with the combination of knowledge, protection and insurance when dealing with risk management.

I think this reflection is very well done, because it explains how he/she dealt with the difficulties that arose when playing it, and it provides feedback on the topic we are learning; therefore I cannot think of another way in which to make it better. </div>
