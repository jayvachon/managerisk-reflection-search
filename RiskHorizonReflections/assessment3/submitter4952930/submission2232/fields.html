    <h1>Submission 2232 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4952930, session_user_id: 72792ec1e84a16cc0cad9c66ddd94b25bad41eed)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><a title="Link: null">1. The role of risk management in this game was about finding the best way to confront risks (which were the various falling comets), preparing for them, and coping with they destruction they caused, if there was any.</a> I made some choices like spending money with insurance and research so I could prevent the comets' damage better. The more prepared I was, the less was the damage caused, the costs to rebuild were cheaper 
					 and also more money was produced, since the pods were repaired faster. Preparation paved the way for development.<br /><br />2. I would save more many for better insurance and less on building more pods so fast, so I could cope better with the damage caused. The main thing I learned from the game was that I have to pay attention on not being overconfident and believing the comets wouldn't damage my pods or underestimate those damages.<br /><br />3. I would propose showing in a clearer way the suffering that comes from not preparing for the risks (e.g. how it affected the people's lives and how those lives could be better if more effort was put in preparing for the incidents).<br /><br /></div>
