    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Role of risk management</b></p>

<p>The purpose
of the game is clearly to show the importance to balance while using the
resources available between the need to develop, making research to find out
underlying risks and to prepare for this risks. In the game building pods and
upgrade them represents development, looking at the incoming comets research
and you can prepare for the risks by building protection and taking insurance
to finance rebuilding once the risks actualize trough the damage created by
falling comets. In the game risk management means finding a balance between
these different aspects that all uses the same resources, time and money.</p>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p><b>Lessons of the game?</b></p>

<p>In the
first game I put too much attention on avoiding risks building protection and looking
at the comets, and was not able to reach my development goal in the first level.
Getting the right balance seemed, however, been much up to look. I might have
identified the right balance in level one, as I managed to pass it several
times. The results of level 2 seemed, however, been most up to good luck. To be
honest, did not manage to seem much difference in games resulting in winning or
losing a level. That was a bit frustrating playing the game. This was probably
not the intention. Or was the purpose to learn preparing for the worst while wishing
for the best? From a pedagogical view the fact that filling the protection bar did
not seem very productive seemed odd. It would have been less frustrating, if
you did not need to restart from beginning all the time. Better instructions
might have made the game less frustrating; for example, I did not know what
connecting the pods after damage required besides research if any. Should I click
the flashes or just watch them flashing?</p>

<p>To be
honest, I do not think I learned from the game anything that I would not have
known before hand or learned from the reading materials of this course so far.
Adding some more reading between the levels might for example have been nice.
If anything, the game induced for some reflection on the need for balance
between the goals of development and risk reduction. </p>

<p><b>One simple addition</b></p>

<p><span>I am born
on the Finnish west coast in an area where there are frequent floods in the
spring when the snow is melting. I have noticed that the flooded buildings are
mostly quite new ones build close to the river, while the old buildings build
on higher ground are usually unaffected. From this perspective the “one simple
thing” I would add to the game is the aspect of location. In the beginning of
the game you could build your pods on plots on higher ground minimizing the
damage, but further on in the game as the safest undeveloped plots are used,
you need to increase your risks and build on lower lying plots. </span></p><span class="_wysihtml5-temp"></span></div>
