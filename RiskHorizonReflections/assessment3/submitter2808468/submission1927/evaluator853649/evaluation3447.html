    <div class="field-value">I really appreciate the student's insightful and brilliant way of making the game more similar to the world he or she lives in. The suggestion that neighbors not only provide "community protection" but can also be a source of harm is very insightful. 
I wish the student did a better job of explaining how on earth he or she got to level 6 of the game! The highest level I reached was only level 3!!!!</div>
