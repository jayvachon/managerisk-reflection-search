    <h1>Submission 1815 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8295679, session_user_id: b76c44c313fb55823d43bef10350deb6ffb6175d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Risk Horizon game prompted me
to address the theory of risk management in a setting whereby both short-term
and long-term implications could be experienced.  The game effectively demonstrates the
challenge of balancing protection and insurance against development and how
seemingly wise short-term decisions can negatively affect long-term growth.   I
played the game several times and my technique changed with each game play.  </p>

<p>To begin with, I adopted a
cautious approach, prioritising protection and insurance over growth.  Although this secured the community in the
short-term, it did not encourage growth or development and consequently did not
allow me to progress in the game.  I
changed my focus from the protection of my pods (raising the land to secure
against the effects of a comet collision) and insurance (securing my pods so
that in the event of a comet collision, I would be partially covered against
any damage) to invest in development and improve research and knowledge-sharing
(through understanding the comets and their potential impact); this allowed my
pods to grow at a more sustainable and secure rate.  However, despite developing my pods at this
steady rate and obtaining lower-level insurance to protect them, several ‘shocks’  (the comets) very quickly destroyed what had
taken a long time to develop.  I could
afford to repair the pods following the first shock, but had few resources left
to address the subsequent shocks and their effects, whilst continuing the level
of growth.</p>

<p>The main learning outcome, for
me, was that a cautious approach, whereby protection methods are prioritised over those of
development, does not always provide long-term benefits as the rate of
development is too slow and does not encourage growth or opportunity.  Combined with a lack of resources (for
example, where there are not enough ‘pods’ to generate income), options became
limited and it becomes more difficult to maintain and provide adequate protection
for the structures in place. 
Furthermore, research can help to negate the effects that a shock has on
a community, by enabling greater preparation and communication between
actors.  Whilst (mainly financial) resources
do help in the implementation of risk management, cheaper aspects such as
research can be just as important in addressing potential shocks.</p>

<p>If I were to change anything in
the game, it would be to add further types of risk to the equation.  By including families in the pods, and
thereby establishing a community, the game could address a variety of risks including food shortages,
financial crises, drought, crime, unemployment and disease.  Many risks are intertwined with others and it
would be useful to examine the complex natures of these, as presented in the game format.</p></div>
