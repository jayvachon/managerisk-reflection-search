    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Clearly, risk and reward trade off against each other although the balance was very hard for me to discern in this Risk Horizon game.  I gathered that the goal was to build increasing levels of pods while racing against the meteor strike clock.  The more advanced your level of pod development, the faster it seemed you accumulated points which I presume relate to economic strength, perhaps a GDP related measure.  Since I could purchase insurance at different levels, and I could delay the impact of a meteor strike and I could raise the level of the development there were tools but each posed a trade off in terms of resource points used and, it appeared, the overall pricing structure for further pod upgrades and future repair costs after a meteor strike.  <br /><br />The biggest difficulty was that I found it very difficult to determine how the pricing structure for repairs and upgrades worked as well as how those details impacted points generation and so was at a bit of a loss as to the most efficient approach. For me that translated so that I was able to get past level 2 several times but was not able to win or move past level three.  <br /><br />So, what does that all mean? Well, with more information a more efficient allocation of development resources could have been found and perhaps the sustainability of the community could have been made more redundant however, given that limited information, the decision calculus for me was to develop the community as quickly as possible, allocated resources for insurance early in the process, upgrade each pod as soon as the resources were freed up due to increased revenues and spend a little bit of resources research each risk factor, the meteors in this game.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
