    <h1>Submission 2379 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 90717, session_user_id: 919041b2eedb2b06477425b8fca4bfa8b82ae2e8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>[1]In this game we balance risk management and healthy
development.</p><p> We should develop our
lands and protect it against Meteors.</p><p>We can use insurance in 3 mode (33%,50% and 70%) ,option to
protect lands against meteors waves and also  research 
on risks(if we do more research we have more chance to decrease
damages.)</p><p>Each risk has some information such as chance of hit and
severity  , risk management role is to
control insurance , research and protection to reduce risks damages and develop
lands.</p><p>We should prepare for risks with using of protection mode ,
insurance , and level up our lands . we should also  research on meteors to have chances to reduce
damages when coping with it and if meteors hit our lands we should repair them
as soon as possible to back levels again.</p><p>Preparation for risks with insuring help us after some time
, when lots of high risks meteors come in sequences  and more research and using wave protection
help development at hit moment. </p><p>[2] I played this game 4 times and reached level 5 at first
try I did small research and used 70% insurance and reached level 2 , at next
tries I start with 50% wave protection and looked at chance of hit and severity
and did large research on high risk meteors and tried to level up lands as much
as possible in lower levels .The main things I learned from this game is that
increase  research and knowledge  is one of the best ways that can make good
situation on coping and <b>preparation</b> with risks. </p><p>













</p><p>[3]If I want to develop a new version of this game I add some
new kind of risk, for example earthquake , war , . . . (In my place typhoon) .
This new risk will make a new multi task risk management problem that its
control will be hard.</p></div>
