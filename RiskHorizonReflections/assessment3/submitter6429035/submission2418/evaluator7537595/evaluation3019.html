    <div class="field-value">I admire the strategy and ability to analyze the game.  

Interesting to note that not just one strategy wins.  I invested more in higher protection rather than insurance and was able to succeed in the game as well.  It teaches us that risk management is an on going process and shows that there is not one correct way to minimize loss. 

Suggestion: improve the "new version" of the game- explain more of the WHY behind your decision. </div>
