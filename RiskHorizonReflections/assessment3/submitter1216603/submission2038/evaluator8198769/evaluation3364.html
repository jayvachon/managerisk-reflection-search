    <div class="field-value">My key strength of this reflection was how it was well linked to real life situations. For instance the linkage of the resemblance of the island at the beginning of the game to a developing country. The very thing that i think will make the reflection better would be the addition of certain popups while playing the game so as to serve as a form of guide or help will playing the game. </div>
