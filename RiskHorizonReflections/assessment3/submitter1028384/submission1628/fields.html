    <h1>Submission 1628 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1028384, session_user_id: 8a38a5ab249cd03e9f6f30452564464d7a3381be)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The role of risk management in the game is basically balancing the three elements to be successful. I felt that knowledge of the impending meteors while helping was not that important so long as you had enough protection to absorb the damage. Insurance, I found was really important in the beginning so you did not have to spend much time building up protection and could spend far greater time upgrading your settlement. In the middle levels the need for insurance diminished, in later levels the need for insurance is increased given the strength and regularity of the strikes.Â </div><div>I played the game twice the first time I played the game taking little care to get insurance and protection this meant that my settlement grew very quickly but when a large disaster did eventually hit my settlement the damage effectively ended my game. The second time I played the game I took a far more balanced approach which meant I lasted much longer. I will say one thing I learnt was the amount of luck involved in being successful there were many times a meteor probably should have hit me but it avoided my settlement.</div><div>In my country there is regular flooding so would have liked to see that in the game and also something such as reducing insurance costs for more developed settlements. It would be more realistic as insurance costs are higher for less economically developed areas and for more economically developed areas insurance costs are reduced.</div></div>
