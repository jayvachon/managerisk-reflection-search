    <div class="field-value">A risk is an event or condition that if it occurs,it will have positive or negative effects on<br />project objectives. Risk has two components which were uncertainty and exposure. It is uncertain because it represents future events. It has possibility of occurring greater than 0% and less than 100%. Risk is something that is present in doing any kind of work. Possibility or probability of some kind without which the work could not be fulfilled. Risk is involved in every planned activity whether it is seen or unseen.<br /><br />Risk management is a continuous procedure which should have to be present in every organization in the process of their developments. In this piece of work we look at the definition of risk and its management through which it can be treated well. Disaster is a hard acceptable truth but it could be stopped or chances of its occurrence could be minimize by proper risk management strategies implemented in the place. We look at the case study of BP oil spill disaster why it was happened and what were its catastrophic results and how it could be stopped in future.<br /><br />Risk is driven through two types of factors involved in any organization which were internal factors and external factors. There also four types financial risk, strategic risk, operational risk and hazard risks.<br />Internal factors contributing to financial risk in any organization were liquidity and cash flow while external factors conclude interest rates, foreign exchange and credit risk.<br /><br />Internal factors contributing to strategic risk were organizations research and development strategies whereas external factors were competition, customer changes, industry changes and customer demands. Internal factors contributing to operational risks were accounting controls, information system, recruitment and supply chain. While external factors were regulation, board composition and culture.<br /><br /><b>Risk handling</b><br /><br />Reduce<br />Accept<br />Avoid<br />Transfer<br /><br /><b>Risk analysis</b><br /><br />Consequences<br />options<br />decision making<br /><br /><b>Risk Assessment</b><br /><br />Quantify<br />Qualify<br />Prioritise<br /><br /><b>Risk Strategy</b><br /><br />Purpose<br />Approach<br />Task<br />Tools<br /><br /><b>Risk Assessment</b>
<br /><br />Risk assessment is a process in which risk has been categorized into different parts. It is a careful examination of what could harm in the work place and people around. It also qualifies the measures those should be put in place for reducing the harms. It is the responsibility of every organization that its workers have been protected by the harms caused by its operations. In oil drilling companies those measures should be highly priorities as because of the nature of activity. The risk was major upon the environment and the consequences of the operations mainly lead to big disaster as well as impacted upon the people. Risk assessment is mainly connected to.<br /><br />Once the hazards identified then the later part is to decide what to do with them. Law requires to do everything “reasonable practicable” to protect people from harm. Controlling measures should be in place firstly, so as to avoid the hazard to an extent. Such as trying less risky option, preventing access to hazardous site, organize work to reduce exposure to hazard, issue personal protective equipments, proving welfare facilities.<br /><br />Operational threats: those were caused by disruption in supplies and operations, loss of access to essential assets, failures in distribution of products or materials etc.<br /><br />Reputational threats: these could be arising because of any big failure which results in disaster.<br /><br />Financial threats: Financial risks are risk which comes from business failure, stock market, interest rates, and unemployment.<br /><br />Technical threats: those were related to the technical difficulty comes in the process because of default in technology by any failure. The new advent of technology is also responsible or taken as threat.<br /><br />My game code is E258QGt</div>
