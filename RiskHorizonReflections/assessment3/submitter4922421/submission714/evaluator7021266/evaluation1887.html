    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the frankness with which the writer expresses himself in this submission, but s/he has not answered the questions as they relate to the reflection requirements; this makes it difficult if not impossible to apply the criteria as outlined in the Grading Rubric for Game Reflection. I think a discourse analysis approach would make this reflection better.</div>
