    <div class="field-value">I would agree with the submission that risk management is crucial so as to win over any risk and lack of adequate preparation subjects us to serial damage which in both short and long run will affect the society; as shown in the game.
Truly, insurance helped a lot in preparing for the effects of the risk, especially to repair the damaged and also in building. There is no way the government of a country will not bear part of the cost of putting damaged structures into place after any possible attack, even if the cost is minimal, but considerable amount of percentage was insured which makes the building affordable for the country, because the cost implication that the country would bear in repairing the damaged properties will be minimal and also affordable.
The consciousness of the risk and also its knowledge also prepared the player of the game (government in term of country/society) to put adequate preventive measures in place and this in a no minimal way sometimes helps to prevent the attack from destroying properties (shock). Though there was an attack, but nothing in terms of lives and property was lost or damaged.
The strategy employed in the second stage was adequate, which was to buy the most expensive insurance and this also allows you contribute little funds in repairing the damaged properties
