    <h1>Submission 1977 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7192, session_user_id: 0cedfccee1d19a73ea7f113ccea72cf1e9405d3a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The risk management plays a crucial role in the game.The falling stars are the major risk against the development of the community.The risk management principles are applied here to keep the risk at bay and keep on with the development and also to remain prepared to avoid or at least decrease the risks to the  minimum  and reduce the damages due to risk as much as possible. I stressed in the development of the community and research and the trade offs were in terms of development and risk preparedness in terms of insurance and lifting the community from deluge due to falling stars.the preparedness for the risk affect development all the time as more research meant not enough time to develop the community also purchasing insurance to avoid risk meant less available funds to undergo development immediately.<br />I played the game multiple times and initially I was focussing on developing fast and not spending eneough time on research which was proving more costly in terms of developement.Also I tried not to waste too much on insurence and protection when I was spending more on insurence and protection before which was hampering the development as resources were weaning.<br />If I was asked to develop a new version of the game the feature that I shall like to add to it will be to make the falling of the stars more accurate.I mean to say that if we can predict the occurance of any event more accurately the loss due to risk will be minimised and the risk preparedness will be in a more consorted manner befitting the imminent risk.I know I am dreaming something which makes risk more predictable but I think that is possible if we try towards that togather.<br /></div>
