    <h1>Submission 1392 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5402245, session_user_id: aa391acdc617b310394d6636524b3a6c12fe98e7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Game was a good mean in conceptualizing risk management. It was
able to highlight crucial elements of risk and strategies that would help to
dealt with them in form of game. In the start I was somewhat bad in using right mix of
strategies but after some time I got familiar. When, I was able to make right
mix of strategies. Then, first of all, I picked insurance than research on coming
event after this I work on upgrading and protection in this way I was able to
protect the island. </p>

<p>I played the game more than once. In the start I was not as
good in using right mix of strategies so after playing it a couple of times I
tried different mix of strategies and noted the results and then applied most
resulting strategies. I learned that in order to mitigate the risk we need to
have timely insurance, right knowledge about the future happening, e cannot
control future but we can confront it.</p>

<p>If, I would be given a chance to upgrade the game, than my
focus would be on the betterment of protection strategies. Throughout game I
was somewhat unsure about the real part of it so in my upgraded version its
role will be highlighted more.Â </p></div>
