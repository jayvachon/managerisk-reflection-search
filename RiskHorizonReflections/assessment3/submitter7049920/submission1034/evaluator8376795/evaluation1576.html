    <div class="field-value">the key strength of this reflection is its clarity and very well organized description of the game. Moreover, it is evident that risk management has been well understood. 
One thing I would have done to make this reflection better is to analyses more carefully how the insurances work. Spending a lot of money to insure nothing is a waste of money, instead this money could have been used in development. As you develop more building, I would have insured them by 75%, therefore, you are well protected on this matter.   </div>
