    <div class="field-value">The key strength of your game essay assignment was your experiences in how-you-played the game.  You took me to your game Level 2 achievement while you seemingly anticipation going to Level 3.  You provided this reader with one of your strategic ploys by reviewing the tutorial. In reflecting on your assignment, I agreed with your observation when you said so eloquently what you learned from playing the game. “…in real life situations when external factors change dynamically, it is tougher to take decisions to achieve progress milestones with limited resources and time.” Taken from our core readings WDR 2014, “…risk management is crucial for unlocking development opportunities, preventing crises, and protection the poor.” If we could just learn and apply this concept. Your paper was clear and concise. I enjoyed reading your paper. Hope you are benefiting from the class content as much as I am. Thanks
One thing that I think would make this reflection better would be for you to describe you experiences in either the fun you had in playing the game or any frustrations you encounter while playing.
