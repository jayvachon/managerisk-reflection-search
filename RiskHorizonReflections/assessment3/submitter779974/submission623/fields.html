    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1) Protecting the community from natural disasters by managing the risk preparation. I, at the beginning, did not care about the level of the ground. I did not think that would be a such an important detail in the game but I realized that is one of two most important actions I should take. The other one is insurance. Other than insurance and leveling up the ground, timing and doing research about the comets are very important parts that I need to aware of. Also, managing the money that i have is extremely important. Buying and leveling up were the preparation for the risk affect development. Wrong management with the money would delay investing on risk management tools such as insurance. I bought the insurance before taking any action on the game. After buying the insurance, I build the community with confidence because I know that if I loose anything from any disaster, my insurance covers up the damage. This gives me confidence and more brave steps to take for the next level. Of course just buying an insurance is not enough because after the disaster, you loose time and effort even the insurance covers the damage but insurance does not give me the time that I lost building again. That is why, besides buying the insurance, getting the ground level higher that the water is very important to minimize the risk. After taking all the preparations, building a community is more secure, easier and healthier. <br /><br />2)I played 5 or 6 times and I realized that the most important think is not just building facilities but also protecting them from the possible risks. This game should be played more than 2 or 3 times because you experience it and see the wrong action or right action that you take. You start to learn what is the most important actions that you should consider first. I would say that building a community without the preparation for risks is sending an invitation to suicide.  <br /><br />I managed the time, buy the highest insurance that save me significant amount of money after fixation caused by hit, leveling up the land as much as I can. The first thing i was doing is buying the insurance and start to build. If i start the build immediately, the community would be hit by a comet and destroy everything that i build. That would be unnecessarily risk. Minimizing the risk is the biggest part of the game. Whenever i get a chance, i improve the level and then improve the community. Building without preparation is a big risk that should not be taken. <br /><br />3)I would like to add evacuation option. That would make the game more realistic. I would like to build emergency shelters that people could be safe in. Also put an alarm system if any comets that has high possibility to hit approaching. People could be aware of the alarm and go to the shelters immediately and stay there until the risk is gone. This kind of precaution could save lives because otherwise people would not know where to go and that would cause a big conflict and uncertainty. With shelters and well organized instructions that lead people to the shelter and how to act under emergency situation, the risk would be well managed and significantly minimized. <br />I live in Istanbul and i would like to see that rules that are already placed applied sharply. That would minimize the risk of crime.People should be aware of knowing that if anybody commits to a crime, would be punished no matter what and the penalty would be intimidating. </div>
