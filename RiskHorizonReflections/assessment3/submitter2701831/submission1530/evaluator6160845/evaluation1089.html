    <div class="field-value">The reflection described the main learning points of the writer during the game. It showed how the elements of risk management was used by the writer during the game.
The key strength of the reflection is in its focus on the learning points -- insurance, protection -- and how it can help in development.
The reflection could have been better appreciated if there were more explanations on the process how the learnings from the game came about or were realized.  The aspect of policy combination is interesting if it could have been elaborated.</div>
