    <h1>Submission 1530 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2701831, session_user_id: 5bb2ad3d95fa22862b04b54480e7dfd804e7dff6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In this game, the role of risk management
is to balance the protection, insurance, development, and observation. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Well, I feel that Insurance is much more
important than what I initially thought. It could cover the majority of the
cost which occurred by damages.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I didn’t realized the power of Protection
is the fir time, so I trade-off a bit of development for protecting when I
played it in later tries.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>What I learnt from this game is that the
balance of policy combination is very hard, but it’s also very important to
policymakers.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I could re-design this game, I would
probably consider giving the player more time for thinking, rather than rushing
with the timing.</p>
