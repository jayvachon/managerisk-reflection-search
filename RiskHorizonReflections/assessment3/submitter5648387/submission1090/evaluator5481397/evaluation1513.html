    <div class="field-value">The game rules are clearly stated in the essay. Further, the different strategies that can be used and their results, are also clearly stated. 
I think that the strenght of the essay is the analysis of the different combinations of the given resouces and their effects.
the reflection is very good. i enjoyed reading it very much. Perhaps an example in real life where the game essence can be reflected would have been a good idea.</div>
