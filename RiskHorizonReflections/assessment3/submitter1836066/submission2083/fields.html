    <h1>Submission 2083 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1836066, session_user_id: 8c25ecbc40d0098f0435b211662af25e8739bbb0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span></span><p>When faced with uncertainty individuals, communities and the state need to be aware of the probability, severity, and impact of the various risks/shocks it is exposed to. </p><br /><p>Individuals must continue to go about their daily lives but at the same time must also be aware of the dangers facing them. By purchasing insurance, fostering community relationships, listening to the radio to be aware of when dangers like hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, landslides, etc., are approaching or have occurred one is better prepared to deal with the effects of these shocks. Careful analysis of one’s available resources and ability to manage the often limited available resources among competing wants and needs allows an individual be a some level of preparedness for risks. Communities can share resources, be it knowledge, financial, or shelter amongst it’s inhabitants to assist those who may not have adequate resources. The state can also play a major role in the dissemination of information and in establishing standards. For example farmers cooperatives, weather offices, agricultural and social ministries of government can provide data and assistance in terms of loans to farmers. Local weather stations can be set up in different areas to collect weather data that can be used to analyze future crop production.The government can also ensure that building codes and bylaws are enforced with the intent that when disaster strike buildings and infrastructure are able to withstand the shocks. </p><br /><p>Insurance is a great tool used as a form of risk transfer. Essentially one has accepted that a risk exists, that the probability of the risk becoming an issue is high, and that the impact could be severe. By purchasing insurance one is trying to lessen the impact of the risk. Often times when the shock happens insurance can help people who may otherwise be too devastated to repair and rebuild housing, of farms as examples. </p><br /><p>While playing the game, it became apparent that the longer one analysed (researched) the incoming meteor one was able to better determine whether insurance was required based on the probability and severity of impact. Once the meteor hit, making community connections reduced and at times totally eliminated damages. At first I bought insurance as soon as the game started, then built the pods. Next I clicked on the meteors and observed the information presented. I only completed level one that time. The  next try at the game, I started building the pods first, then raised the island. Next I clicked on the various meteors and observed them for a while. As I was observing the meteors my cash reserves began to increase. After realizing that the meteor had a high probability of impact and severity, I purchased the highest level of insurance available. Using this strategy I was able to reach level 3 of the game. If I was to develop a new version of the game I would allow a longer time period to reflect cyclical nature of many risks/shocks and as well the sometimes extended time periods over which some manifest themselves. </p><div><span><br /></span></div></div>
