    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The aim of the game was to manage risk for development. Should you invest in protection or invest completely and only in development. The answer of this is different in any situation. But in general it can be said by managing the risk and optimal development can be achieved. So don't take too much risk and invest only on development, but also don't take too much risk and invest only in development. Find a balance between development and protection of your created development. I experienced this during the game. It was good the game lets the player create a risk management strategy and ways to identify, prioritize, and address obstacles.<br />The first time I invested too much in protection, which didn't let me to get the necessary development. The second time I took a more compromise between development and protection, which led to reaching level four. In the end I was focussing too much on development, which led to a setback concluding that it is important to keep the focus on balancing development and protection. By playing the game a good understanding of different types of risk management is achieded, as for instance protection, insurance, coping. And besides that it is a basic example of getting to know who to identify these activities in different settings.Â <br />To optimize the game it might be an add to show how much an investment increases development. In this way a better substantiated choice can be made between balancing development and protection. In that way the player can better recognize the necessary actions and reforms that can improve risk management and reduce the obstacle to it.</div>
