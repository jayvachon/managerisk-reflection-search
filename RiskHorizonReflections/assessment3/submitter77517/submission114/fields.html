    <h1>Submission 114 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 77517, session_user_id: 56c1b64cb0fb2e3277f10ecc963c73ccfeed7d6a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The question for this game is how to find a good move while making best use of available time. This game must meet external time-constraints which only having a few minutes to reach decision. In practice, the quality of the move decision usually improves the further the games look ahead. How safe is the move? The goal is to minimize the risk from a threat and at the same time is to maximize the gains from putting a pod. For me, as fast as possible, I put a pod before the threat comes. Once the threat comes, I click the threat and hopefully I do not get hit by the threat. I immediately react once the threat come. In addition, protection is added in full to minimize the damage that is caused by the threat. 
If I were given a chance to play again, I consider to upgrade the pod as soon as possible instead of build several pod. Thinking too much about the protection of the threat might not a best idea to maximize the gain. If we have a chance, then we should go further to build and upgrade the pod and of course, we need to pay for the insurance to cover it. In addition, we need also to consider the cost effectiveness in building and upgrading the pod. Shall we build a lot of pods or build a few with upgrade pods? We can build pods with upgrade enhancements if we have already bought an insurance to reduce the damage from the threat. The investment of time and effort to decide should be kept minimum or in other words, we need to react before the threat comes. I learn how to predict the accuracy of the risk, how to prevent and minimize the risk, how to react if the threat comes, and also measure the likelihood of type of the threat. 
When assessing the risk, we should take a look at several alternatives that can preserve our capital. I would add a bonus to increase our capital, so we can build and upgrade in a faster method. In addition, there should be another ways how to prevent the threat hitting us. For example, we can add more alternative ways to protect our pods. Not just the insurance to protect, but there should be another alternatives besides insurance to cover for the risk. Additional information such as how to measure the dependency of each move should be known to player so the player knows the likelihood of the threat, how strong is the threat so the player can prepare for an assessment to reduce the damage. In conclusion, Risk management is a good practice tool to increase our capital and at the same time to reduce damage. </div>
