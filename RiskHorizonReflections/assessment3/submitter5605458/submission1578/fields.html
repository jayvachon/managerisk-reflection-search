    <h1>Submission 1578 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5605458, session_user_id: 03333710d0c569f4bd9fdcf9d9e41a559afbed98)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game was to ensure the least damage (or ideally no damage) to the pods when the comet hit the island. </p>
<p><br /></p>
<p><span>The choices I needed to make was to decide on the level of protection, insurance cover and research in order to provide an effective level of risk management and growth of the community. The trade-off I was faced with was a cost of insurance cover and protection. The protection seemed much more expensive then the insurance cover but in case of high severity impacts both forms of protection were needed to prevent damage to the pods and reduce the cost of rebuilding them. Protection efforts had a direct impact on the speed of development - more protection meant fewer pods. In case of higher insurance cover the number of pods  built or upgraded was decreased, which consequently had a knock-on effect on the speed of earning money. However, without insurance cover the costs of rebuilding the pots would’ve been much higher.</span></p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>If I were to play the game again, I would pay more attention to the probability of the hit. My main attention was on the severity and preparation levels needed rather then a probability, which sometimes resulted in me being overprotective and slowing down speed of the development.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>The main things I learned from this game were:</p>
<ul><li>the need to balance out development &amp; growth while having in place an adequate risk management program,</li>
<li><span>the need to be realistic about probability of risk (not to under or overestimate the risk). </span></li>
</ul><p><br /></p>
<p><span>If I were to introduce a change to this game I would like to add a social response to the thread of comets damaging pods. I think many of us are easily influenced by others when it comes to making decisions. It would be good to see if the person playing the game would make correct risk management decisions when faced with different levels of concern about the forthcoming threads coming from the pods. This new addition would require that the player not only estimates the possible risk and chooses the right level of protection and preparation but also listens or ignores the comments coming from the community depending on the circumstances (based on research only available to the player). This new addition would give the player a chance to develop a better sense of what risk management feels like in a more complex environment, and how community views (based on personal views, beliefs ...) are not necessarily to be trusted. </span></p></div>
