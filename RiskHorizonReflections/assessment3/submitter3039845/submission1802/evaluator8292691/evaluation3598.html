    <div class="field-value">What was very noteworthy in the reflection is the author's understanding of the delicate balance between insurance, protection, and knowledge as exemplified in the game. Furthermore, he/she also highlighted their importance to directing development, which, in my opinion, is a core lesson taught in this entire program. The  reflection shows adequate understanding of this framework and the ability to explain it efficiently to other interested readers. Good job.</div>
