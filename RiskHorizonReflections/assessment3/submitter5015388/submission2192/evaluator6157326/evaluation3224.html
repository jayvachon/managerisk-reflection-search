    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is that the fudndametal coempoents of risk managment has well learned and explained. In addititon, th eimprotance of balancing devlopment and risk managment has. Wwell understood. I would think one thign that make this reflection better is to avoid or minimize repeating of the guidance/instruction of the game plus remove or imporve the sayign of " undertaking insurance protection which covered 75 % of the risk we could minimize the chances of being hit," which rather said to have more damage compensation if it hit. Other wise insurcne never avoid event.</div>
