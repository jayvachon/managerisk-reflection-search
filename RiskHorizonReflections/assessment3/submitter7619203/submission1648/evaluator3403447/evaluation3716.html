    <div class="field-value">This reflection does evaluate the game experience well and shows that the writer took time to understand the game and its relation to risk management. The only thing I would suggest to make it better is to improve the grammar. There were some grammar errors that made some of the sentences run on and a little confusing. However, overall, this was a good reflection.</div>
