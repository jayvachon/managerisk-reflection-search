    <h1>Submission 1067 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8172173, session_user_id: ba3a44c97bcc7c5d543f4bb125d2642ff71c0186)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">What was the role of risk management in the game?<br />Risk management was used to mitigate the losses caused by asteroids and to enable the resilient development of a prosperous civilization. Preparation (getting to know how to play the game) and coping (play the game by making clever decisions) were key factors for mastering the game.<br /><br />What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance?<br />The main trade-offs in this game were related to protection (by raising the ground) and economic growth (by upgrading the facilities). Since the main target was to accumulate a certain level of wealth during a given time, one has to constantly decide on either spending the money on protection or development. It was also possible to get an insurance but this required only one payment upfront. Consequently, it was important to save some money (by foregoing upgrading the facilities) at the end of each level in order to be able to afford an insurance.<br /><br />In what ways did preparation for risk affect developmemt (immediately, or after some time)?<br />The preparation for risk had a significant impact on the damages on the facilites of the developing civilization. The negative effects of these damages could be mitigated by conducting some research, raising the ground and getting an insurance in the ex ante risk management phase.<br /><br />What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?<br />Since I live in a country that is known for its alpine regions, a game could be developed that is about risk management concerning avalanches.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
