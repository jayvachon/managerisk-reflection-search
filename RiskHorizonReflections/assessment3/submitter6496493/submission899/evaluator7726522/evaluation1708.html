    <div class="field-value">The reflection did not draw learnings from the game and apply the same to a real-life situation. The submission's key strength was understanding of the strategy in playing the game and providing a simplified learning tool.

I think a better approach may have been to address the kind of quality of nuances one may have improved upon or created a more realistic view of how one could manage risks. While there are trade-offs, it is not a game of skill.</div>
