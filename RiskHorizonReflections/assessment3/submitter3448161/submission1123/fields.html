    <h1>Submission 1123 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3448161, session_user_id: c69f6ed0d0effd35f0007f591644c6ab9c7c853c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in the game was to manage balance between building blocks (development) and protecting from comets (research, protection and insurance). When protecting from comets my strategy had been to protect as much as I could. That means that when I have noticed the comet I researched it a little bit at the beginning and than if severity were high I built protection to protect the city from that severity. If severity and probability were both high I bought insurance. <br /><br />I started the and spend all the money i had both on development and protection. In my opinion better strategy would be to save some money in case of big disaster, but it's difficult to do that in Â such a game where you want to build as much as you can.<br /><br />I also guess that during the game I haven't invest enough in research. Since I played the game once and came to 5th level I guess that role of research (knowledge) is underestimated in the game. That would be my suggestion for the area where this game could be improved.<br /><br />All to all, great attempt to simulate real life risk management.<br /><br /><br /></div>
