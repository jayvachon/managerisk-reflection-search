    <h1>Submission 2335 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6664377, session_user_id: ebbe6cbe1c2815e414ebe843bc15bb9b5e4f32d2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The Risk Horizon game is tricky in an
interesting way and risk management truly plays an important role in the game.
The most essential part of it is to control the whole picture - see the
emergency and give up things that matter less. For example, when the chance of
being hit is rather slim, players do not need to do research all the time.
Since the time and money are limited, they should spend more on building
protection. However, when the severity and chance are all high, and the
observation is less effective in this way, buying insurance seems to be a
safeguard. However, the preparation for risk has two-side effects on the development.
Lifting up the ground would cost both time and money, buying insurance would
cost quite a lot of fortune, and observing aerolites would be time-consuming;
therefore the preparation would get in the way of development immediately. But
after some time, both the observation and the lifted ground would decrease the
damage. And in the long run, the preparation, especially the insurance would
save a great when damage unfortunately happens.</p><p><br /></p><p>I played the game three times to reach the
Level 4. At first I tried hard to strengthen the protection, but successive
hits were unbearable. Later I learned to buy insurance and to do research about
the potential destruction. The main thing I learned was to make the game
controllable. When the chance of being hit is too small to pay attention to, or
when the severity of the hit is not noticeable, players are able to concentrate
on developing and meanwhile give up all the peripheral.</p><p><br /></p><p>The game captures the essences of risk
management in some ways, and I would like to add one simple element to the new
version of the game â€“ external support. When an investment appears to be
promising, people from outside would be likely to give their supports, which would
further strengthen the development and increase the ability to defend risks,
and that could be the hits in the game. Therefore, to better represent the risk
management choices that matter in real life, outside support like protective
barrier could be added into the game. To sum up, the game is really inspiring
and worth playing.</p></div>
