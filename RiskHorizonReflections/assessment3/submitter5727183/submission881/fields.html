    <h1>Submission 881 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5727183, session_user_id: 47adb59af07abd4a15b51a448991e9b514861477)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Stopping the EEEVVIILL Comets!</strong><br /><br />Well, firstly this was a blast. I had a lot of fun with this. However, there's a lot more of course. By giving us the power to protect our community through knowledge, protection and insurance, we get almost a first hand taste at how tricky risk management can truly be for all the global economies and its leaders. The need to continuously develop the community only adds difficulty to the process, but such is the reality, for no economy remains stagnant during risk management.<br /><br />I played the game 4 times, and the first 2 times, I tried doing everything, rushing into decisions and not really understanding how to best balance it out. Eventually, I realized that if I had sound knowledge and research about the comets and took necessary steps to protect, I would not need to rely on insurance, and with that headache gone, I was able to better implement my mind to growing the community simultaneously and thus perform better at the game and reach level 4. I also realized that just like real life, pay-off isn't immediate, and it's best to prepare early, to research a severe comet as much as possible and protect from as early as possible to have the best chances of being able to survive it. This was exactly like predicting a natural disaster as quickly as possible to minimize the damage caused by it, and it's amazing that a simple game could show such a profound understanding. This was my main learning, a better understanding of just how important it is to not procrastinate, to not let our behavioral habits refrain us from what we must do but rather to proactively seek to implement risk management strategies as rapidly as possible.<br /><br />I'll be honest when I say that this game captures the basic of risk management quite nicely. However, if I were to add an element to the game, I'd shy away from a comet attack and add something more frequently occurring and relevant to the global world. Thus instead of the arrival of comets, I would show the community to be by the sea, and different levels/categories of hurricanes approaching it. This little tweak would allow people to better connect with the game and 'feel' it more, for the lack of a better word.<br /><br />In conclusion though, it was quite the insightful experience and I congratulate the course designers on having such a wonderful way of engaging our curious minds and further our learning on this most relevant topic.<br /><br />:)<br /><br /><br /></div>
