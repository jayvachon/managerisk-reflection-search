    <div class="field-value">There seems to be an appreciable understanding of risk management principles. The key strength of this reflection is the provision that there is a dire need to balance both growth/ risk management and also the different components of risk management. This is the foundation of effective risk management. However it is my humble opinion that as the concepts are understood, more effort should have been put in towards better describing the role of knowledge/ protection and insurance; rather than describing in detail what happened in the game.    </div>
