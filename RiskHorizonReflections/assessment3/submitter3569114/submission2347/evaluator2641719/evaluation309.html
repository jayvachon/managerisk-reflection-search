    <div class="field-value">This student accurately undestands the main objectives of this course and it is well reflected in this reflection . He could also draw parallels between game and real life . But he could answer more questions in his reflection , than he did . Second and third questions are not anwered in this reflection at all . But the first one is eluminated very well . For example , I'd like to hear from this student about his thoughts in changing or adding new features to this game . The reflection was written in academic words ,so  it was very pleasantly and interesting  while reading too. </div>
