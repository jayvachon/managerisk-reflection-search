    <div class="field-value">The main strength of this reflection is the focus on the management of time and application of the concept to a nuanced approach to risk management. Additionally, the submission refers to a simulator, which is an interesting approach to risk management other than the usual weights and scoring models. It does fit in well with the game, and that is something which sounds to be something one would investigate further. Overall, it is a reasonable take on risk management and takeouts from the game are apparent.</div>
