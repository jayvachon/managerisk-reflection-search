    <div class="field-value">Try to keep the points you're making relevant. With the second question I believe they were asking what you as a player would do differently and your first part to this answer sound like what the developer of the game should do differently. 

The relevant points you did make however were very clear and showed excellent knowledge of risk assessment needs in Nepal.
