    <h1>Submission 379 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 311934, session_user_id: 80fda88d09d51a1472694fb471c6b34c5780877d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game Risk Horizon taught the
importance of risk management in developing a community. The growth of a
community should not just focus on developing the community but also on
managing the risks. This is because without the risk management, the potential
impact of the risk can be detrimental to the growth of the community.</p>

<p>With the game, balancing the
development (developing the pods) and risk management (research and insurance) is
the tricky part. Yes, in order to progress in the game, the development quota
should be achieved in each level, but the impact of the comet, if not
addressed, can easily reverse its growth. To achieve the game’s objective, I made
the following choices/tradeoffs/decisions:</p>

<p>1.      
Purchased the cheapest insurance for each level.</p>

<p>2.      
I did not just stop in achieving the expected
development for each level but ensured that I am ahead in developing my pods to
prepare for the next levels.</p>

<p>3.      
I did not waste my time doing research on low-severity-and-low-chance-of-hitting
comets.</p>

<p>4.      
If the comet is a high-severity-and-high-chance-of-hitting,
I do ample research on them to increase my knowledge and community connection.</p>

<p>5.      
During idle times, I ensure that I increase my
level of protection.</p>

<p>All these activities did not happen
one at a time but some happened simultaneously. For example, while upgrading my
pods, I do research on high-severity-and-high-chance-of-hitting or I increase
my protection. </p>

<p>This strategy I have come up with
did not come after playing the game once but after several attempts of playing.
In the first few attempts I focused too much on managing the risk and too
little on development thus I was unable to reach level 6. Then in my next attempts,
I tried to balance risk management and development but still failed because I only
on short term goal and that is to pass the particular level. But this game
taught me to think strategically in terms of my decisions if I want to win. Hence,
as much as possible I continued to upgrade my pods even if the development
meter is colored green already to ensure that I have enough income for the succeeding
levels.  </p>

<p>Moreover, this game taught me
that in order to achieve growth, several risks can be neglected – the risks
with low severity and probability. And to learn if the risk is with low
severity and probability, it is important to study and do research on the
possible risks to occur. Being proactive and not reactive when it comes to
risks is critical to development. This can help in planning and in strategizing
the decisions to be made. </p>

<p>Lastly, risk management does entail
expenses (money and time) and can immediately affect the development process but
the long term benefits of risk management in development are worth the price. There
are uncertainties that can be avoided if a good management plan was made. For
example, building evacuation centers for flood-prone areas is a good solution to
avoid deaths during a calamity.  Another example
is by purchasing insurance, though it can be expensive, will surely minimize
the potential shock that can be experienced during a disaster.</p>

<p> Now, if given the chance to change some
components of the game, I will suggest that there are technologies that a
player has the option to invest at in order to further minimize the impact of
risks. This can further test the player’s decision making in putting a balance between
risk management and development. Also, this decision to invest or not is a good
test to us coming from third world countries where money is important and every
cent matters.       </p>
