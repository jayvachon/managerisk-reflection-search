The understanding of the fact that each region, culture, village face their own risk is vital, so there is off course a lot to learn by researching others experiences, but we learn the most out of our own experiences, these takes time and sometimes failure in order to learn for past mistakes. Risk management is a continuous leraning process, and some times the most obvious solution is not at our reach, so we have to think of alternatives, consider worst case scenarios and always go an extra mile to be prepare for these contingencies. </div>
