    <div class="field-value">The main point of the student's reflection was the speed of reaction one must have before deciding to which extent insurance and protection should be provided. 
The shortcomings he experienced are a consequence of the trade-offs he was experienced with and this shows that he assimilated well the idea of the game.
Last but not least, I would like to congratulate the student for his/her good work.</div>
