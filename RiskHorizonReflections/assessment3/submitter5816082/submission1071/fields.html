    <h1>Submission 1071 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5816082, session_user_id: b82854a9bcb78ae57175216fec8839e82e81f8a5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management; the identification of risk as opportunity
of gain rather than loss.</p>

<p>Every activity involves gain or loss, as depicted in the
game where to gain more protection, the player may not reach the next level. </p>

<p>Protection of resources must be sought especially when the
resources expended is enormous. Playing the game, the more the community is
upgraded, the higher the level of protection needed to safeguard the community
from the damages caused by the comets.</p>

<p>Also, the willingness to protect the community is higher
when the resources spent are high.</p>

<p>Insurance cover may not necessarily be needed if adequate
protection of the community is provided. I discovered, from the game, that I
had to improve the protection level at the inception of each stage in the game
which in turn prompts me to buy insurance policy of the lowest amount. This
happens in life where little or no foreseeable risk exists especially where the
cause of such possible risk from loss is can be predicted with high margin of
accuracy.</p>

<p>To identify risk in every venture is the key to coping with
shocking loss if they arise. Therefore, our everyday life has to involve the
estimation of possible risk of loss from any venture and also being optimistic
that gain will always arise therein.</p>

<p>It is obvious that, there is always more possibility of gain
than loss from every event.</p></div>
