    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span><strong>MY GAME REFLECTION </strong></span></p>

<p> The concepts of risk and
disaster are associated with a disorder and chaos involving what is established
in its normal order very obvious reality. These situations are very harmful to
the people especially those in need. </p>

<p>In doing
so, the paradox remains that the risk is inevitable for humanity, hence the
need for countries and organizations to establish an effective plan and goal to
control seizures. This plan should be a priority of development policies
implemented in the State. Research into risk therefore facilitates the passage
of expertise to the decision to avoid social chaos often observed and very
detrimental to the integrity and human dignity. </p>

<p>In this
game, the role of risk management has been taking the necessary precautions to
prevent their falling comets do not cause waves that hinder development on my
territory (Alora). In doing so, I got first information about the
characteristics of each obstacle in terms of its severity, my chances of
avoiding it. This analysis allowed me to know the kind of power to deploy
between the'' Search'', the'' protection'' and'' insurance''; knowing that each
deployed strategy may cost me a lot of resources. </p>

<p>Strategy''
Search'' allowed me to better inform me on comets to know what type of
protection deployed. Strategy'' protection'' has allowed me to avoid the damage
or reduce their intensity if they managed to reach my territory. On the
strategy of'' insurance'', it allowed me to repair the damage caused by
obstacles in my territory and which could reduce the development time lost. </p>

<p>My first
experience with this game has not been a success. Later, I understood that it
was very early advice about the obstacles, develop defense mechanisms and
create non-vulnerable areas. '' Zero’’ risk does not exist, so I sometimes
opted for insurance to repair the damage in case of attack. </p>

<p>For the
improvement of means of protection, I suggest that there are techniques for
destroying threats before they reach my territory. I also suggest that there
are early warning systems to evacuate the people who are in risk zones. It will
also raise awareness and inform them precautions taken in case of attack.</p>

<p>These precautions
will reduce damage in case of attack on human and material plans. During the
post-attack period, it must also help those affected to recover with dignity
and rebuild their future populations. It was a very instructive game and it allowed
me to better understand the concept of risk management. </p>

<p><span>It allowed
me to learn to develop strategies for research, prevention and adaptation.</span></p></div>
