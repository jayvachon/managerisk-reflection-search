    <h1>Submission 727 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7222322, session_user_id: ba8bcedadc7ac7032f5d22c94df7acb82139c491)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk management has a tremendous effect in the game because
you are building a colony and trying to avoid comets.  A person needs to understand how to mitigate
the risks using protection, knowledge, and insurance.   That is the role of risk management in this
game.  At the beginning of the game, I
was a little skeptical about the process. 
As I went through each comet, then everything came into play.  First, I started building the hubs as part of
the process.   The game started to build
the hubs and comets started showing up in the atmosphere.  As part of the building the hubs, I was
getting charged $200 for each.   The game allowed me to research the comet by
providing the option to research the severity and chances of hit.  Based on this step, I started to move the
level of the hubs above the ground, so that there is protection from the
natural disaster.    My
values started to go up as well as the green bar on the left side of the
screen.   The game also provided a scheme to buy
insurance for the hubs using dollars in the account.  I ended up buying the insurance and purchased
only 33% percent of the insurance because it was more than enough.   </p>

<p>As the game proceeded I got hit on some comets with misses,
hits with 9% and 20% damage, or no damage.  
I took the game as a challenge and continued to proceed, but it was
really tough because of the multiple comets. 
 This process affected the
development because as soon I got hit with 9% or 20%, then the green bar came
down as well as the protection.  Again, I
had to repair the hubs and also increase protection.  Another aspect, which made this game tough,
is the timed process.    A game player is allowed only 3 minutes or so
in each level to meet its final destination.   The hits sometimes brought me down and
eventually ended up losing in level 2, then re-tried again and again to get
level 4. If I played the game only once, then I would have to make the
trade-offs precisely at the beginning. 
When I’m sure that a comet is not going to hit, then the protect level
would stay the same.   On the other hand,
if the comet is going to hit hard, then I would increase the protect level.  At the same time, I would continue to build
the hubs to its appropriate stage for each level.  If I played the game again and again, then I
would continue to improvise the trade-offs between protection and
insurance.  I learned quite a bit in this
game because you have to do proper research, make efficient trade-offs, and
apply knowledge to successfully mitigate risks. 
 </p>

<p>If the game is built according to the D.C. area, then
several things have into play.  There
needs to be a risk team preparing for natural disasters through plans.  It is not simple to just do repairs for the
hubs, but there are several aspects.  Possibly,
have a risk plan showing the trade-offs and its impact.  The risk plan should available to view all
activities and events. The plan should prioritize risks based on the comets
that are arriving in the atmosphere.  
Based on this aspect, a player should prioritize which trade-offs to
make for a particular comet.  If the game
is developed in-depth, there should be some focus on the environmental impact
and assess risks based on its impact.  The
game should also consider human casualties as part of the process not just
building or hubs.</p>
