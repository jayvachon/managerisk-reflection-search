    <div class="field-value">The reflection gives a clear view of how Risk management tools are implemented in the game.
I think that one thing to make this reflection better is to write a little bit more about playing the game, however, I liked how the student was able to describe the major point of the game, playing experience and suggestions to the game in a comprehensive and clear manner.</div>
