    <h1>Submission 2243 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5724736, session_user_id: fbc41df26ced12381eeb97a8cfac72effc4c507b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game was to teach the
players to be well prepared for risks so that minimum damage is caused when a
disaster strikes. While playing the game I always made sure that I had at least
50% insurance so that if a meteorite struck the island, it would cause minimum
damage. Also I made sure that I had protection at least equivalent to the
severity of the meteorite. Preparation for risk according to me affected development
immediately, as development can be seen in the level of preparedness for the
risk.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When I played the game for the second time I made sure I did
more research to measure the severity of the meteorite hit which I did not do
when I played for the first time. While playing this game I learnt that
insurance is a very important component of risk management and the cost of
insurance pays off when a disaster strikes. It helps one to cope with the
damages caused by the disaster. Also researching about the disasters and the
different kinds of risks, helps one to be better prepared and reduces the
impact of the damages.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I had the option to add something to the game I would
provide a variety of risks (like floods, earthquakes etc.), so that the player
understands that there are different kinds of risks one is prone to and one
should be prepared for all those risks. Also it would teach the player that
different risks need to be tackled in different ways. In real life my
surroundings are prone to earthquakes and also flooding due to the sea being close
by. People living here and in other areas should be well prepared for any kind of
risk that the area has faced in the past and also any other future potential
risks.</p></div>
