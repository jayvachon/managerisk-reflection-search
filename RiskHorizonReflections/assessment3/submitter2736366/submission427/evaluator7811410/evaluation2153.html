    <div class="field-value">This is a very explanatory yet concise reflection of the game. The essay was properly outlined and the use of language was simple. I thoroughly enjoyed reading your piece and even learned more about the game and Risk Management in general from this. Is there anyway you can make this reflection better? Publishing a compendium on Risk Horizon will suffice perhaps. Good job.</div>
