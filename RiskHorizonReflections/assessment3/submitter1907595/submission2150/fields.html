    <h1>Submission 2150 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1907595, session_user_id: 370cebf5a925766cf1dab3572cfcfc4648bdf3a7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of risk management was decide when/how much to develop with the threat of the comets and the consequences of the comments. In terms of choices, I decided to research the level of severity and to then build up adequate protection. I would only purchase insurance if there were a large amount of high-severity comets in the horizon. Preparing for risk certainly impeded development. If the comets were particularly severe, it did not make sense to further develop some pods or even create others, as the amount of protection/resources needed would out-weight the benefits of development. This however, impacted the development goal, which lead to its ultimate failure. It demonstrated that even though you may have all of the tools, knowledge, and resources available, it cannot always lead to success if the threat is too large and varied. <br /><br />2. I played the game more than once and I kept making mistakes (although different ones) at critical points. When building up too much protection, I may have had money, but I still failed to reach the development goal. When developing at a faster rate, I sustained more and more expensive damages. If I spent too much time on research, I was spending enough time on protection or development. While it was easier to succeed in the early levels, it was much harder to maintain a good balance of protection, research, and development in the later levels. If I played it again, I think I would try different balances of those three aspects. In a way, this is an interesting way to experiment, as you would not have this ability in the real world. There is no 'restart' when discussing real people, disasters, and communities, which demonstrates the high-level stakes those involved with international development deal with on a daily basis. <br /><br />3. I would propose an "ask for help" button. This would mean that a certain amount of money (there could be degrees, such as with the insurance) would be go to an outside group. In return you could choose for 'outside research', 'outside development', or 'outside protection'. However, you do not get a say in how it is applied. Thus, the 'outside development' could develop pods further or it would just create new pods. 'Outside research' would either perform long research on one comet or short research on several comets, and 'outside protection', would raise to be just enough protection or too much. These would have an effect on your continued actions in the game. I think this would reflect how outside help can sometimes work in real life situations. The places that need research/development/protection cannot always do it themselves and have to hire others, but as a result, they do not always get to decided how it will be done, whether it is for the better or worse. In each case, it would be a gamble if it would help you progress to the next level or not, which is how it is in real life. </div>
