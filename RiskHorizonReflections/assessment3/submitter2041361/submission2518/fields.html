    <h1>Submission 2518 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2041361, session_user_id: 1eac001a73789875bf314ccf70c31478dd7abcb3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk management
is the gist of the game. You should find the balance between growing and
protecting your pods. Insurance is handy too as it reduces the cost of repair. Preparation
for risk costs a lot but then, when a comet hits, you are ready and do not
endure severe damage. So, you have to spend money now to keep and grow money
later.</p>

<p>I played only once
and at the beginning I was trying to protect mostly, but then I realized that
this is not a right policy there. You canâ€™t protect your pods 100%, because you
should develop them and make them grow. You have to reduce damage, but do not
spend all your resources on it.</p>

<p><span>Maybe, it would be
good to introduce some bonuses. When you are doing good for a long time, something
good will happen, like a good rain or a sunny day.</span></p></div>
