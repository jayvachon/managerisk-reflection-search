    <div class="field-value">I thought the idea of the number of deaths of people was good as well as the idea that different areas have different risks. Where I lived we had a lot of severe floods this winter and some peoples home were very badly damaged, others only slightly affected and some people not at all.

I would have liked to know more about what they learnt from the actual game, and what effect changing their strategy had on the outcome of their game. </div>
