    <div class="field-value">Strength: The author seems to have a clear understanding of the game and has strong critical thinking skills in order to clearly explain the game in context with the course. 
One thing that could make this better: In a short analysis, there is was too much summary of the game and therefore less analysis to how the game had to do with the game. </div>
