    <h1>Submission 1567 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8308025, session_user_id: 33f9e82b12fe4c3bf05a7c2f1498057f9660a1c0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This
game teaches us the how to manage risks. In fact, it was incredibly challenging
and the level of difficulty kept increasing. It taught us how crucial it is to
research on risks as well as take preventive measures so as to protect oneself.
The tutorial educated me on how the game is supposed to work. It gave me an
insight on how I was supposed to go about this game.</p><p>As
I was the luminator of Alora, the task handed out to me was to ensure there was
growth in the Land of Alora and see to that there is advancement in the society
by building pods and making the environment is safe from meteors. The levels
were excruciatingly difficult but the upside was that, I realized how risk
prevention was very much required in today’s world as our world does indeed
face crisis on an everyday basis.</p><p>Before
we start the construction of building pods, one of the most important things to
keep in mind is to be sure of the cash we have in hand. Investment amount is
vital for growth and development. I learnt how to strike a balance between
development with risk and also the amount I needed to protect Alora. The
obstacles that hindered the growth of Alora were the ever falling comets. These
comets careen in to the waters and cause waves that destroyed the existing pods.
These pods were insured against the damage caused by these mighty waves. With
due research, the comets could be avoided. The adequate research would help us
know whether the comets would strike or not. This showed that the community had
to strike a balance between the betterment of the society or community as well
as the potential meteor showers.</p><p>To
be honest, I couldn’t get a hang on the game on my first try. With restarting
the level I realized my mistakes and started making amends immediately. I started
raising the land so as to protect the community from potential meteors. I
continued to develop the community, but did more than enough research on the
pods. When it was hit, insurance was used to cover the damage and did my best
to make sure there wasn’t much damage or the damage was close to nil.</p><p>Research
played a key role in learning how the mysterious meteors worked. I got the
chance to educate myself on them and also to take adequate measures to mitigate
the risks and possible damages that they would/had caused.</p><p>When
I played the game for the second time, I started taking a higher rate of 75%
insurance policy so that the damages caused, started costing less. It also
minimized the risks on being hit by the meteor shower. </p><p>All
these above measure weren’t taken when I played the game for the first time,
hence, my first loss. These were things I kept in mind when I played it for the
second time.</p><p>













</p><p><span>If
I were given a chance to modify the game, the research that was being provided
would give more information that will help us learn more. The time constraints
would be slightly longer. A meteor shower, though not unrealistic, it’s still
not the kind of risk that one would face on a regular basis. So in order to
make the game more relatable to our daily life, I would create a real life
situation. Also I would add another item wherein, we could gain more money so
as to protect ourselves and will be able to pay for the damages done.</span></p></div>
