    <h1>Submission 2551 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3011545, session_user_id: 47c4ab99c9b73fea6aa582c8bdb67e74124b25dc)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Role of risk management in the game is that you must decide how to spend your resources to reduce damage from comets while developing your village infrastructure to reach goal. You must choose how spend you wealth: build new house or buy insurance, upgrade structure or protect whole village. </p><p>Overpreparations on early levels can seriously harm possibility to reach goals on last levels. E.g. if you will spend too much time on "Power of protection" it is possible you will not reach your goal for level; or if you will spend too much money on insurance it will be possible that you will not have enough money for to upgrade your building and because of that it will be impossible to reach goal on levels from 4 to 6.</p><p>While playing first time I'am spend too much resources on protection measures and not enough resourses on upgrading buildings. Main thing that I learn was to balance time and resources properly. And that what if you spend some quality time researching your risk it will make risk much more dangerous.</p><p>One thing that I want to change in a game is some sort of a scale wich show what kind of benefit player getting from new building or upgrade of existing building.</p></div>
