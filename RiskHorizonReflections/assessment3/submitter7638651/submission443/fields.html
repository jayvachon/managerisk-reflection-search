    <h1>Submission 443 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7638651, session_user_id: 42f5179afa5c563683ee09db26b28bcff1c85aa4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Risk management was used to help direct the limited resources we had in a way that would allow us to "develop" fast enough during each stage.  We had to choose between putting our time towards raising the level of "protection", researching the asteroids which had the potential to damage our community or the short time required to click on a property and upgrade (which took a while when you had built on all plots).  Another limited resource available was money, which could be directed towards either insurance, investing in the community to allow faster development or in increasing our protection to be more resilient to asteroid impacts. In order to meet the development needs of the stage, you were forced to either develop new plots of land or to upgrade previously developed plots to allow for an increase in production to the level necessary for the stage. Often I found I did not take enough risk and was not able to meet the output level for the stage, so net time I played I would increase my risk appetite during each successive play of the game.  Also I found that once I had raised the land to a suitable level to cover most asteroids, it freed me up to focus on ensuring that the level of production output was sufficient to pass the level (making sure the output was always in the green).

2. I played the game more than I care to admit and I learnt some interesting thing which helped me get to level 6.  Firstly, reading the instructions helped me progress further, which an important part of risk engagement as I jumped straight into playing and didn't realise you could strengthen the communities in that time after an asteroid hit and reduce the chance of damage.  Secondly, using the trackpad on my laptop allowed me to connect my community faster than using the mouse.  During the first stages I would spend money on insurance as soon as I could afford it, however in later games I would wait until I was sure that there was a comet about to land that I did not have enough protection for and usually bought it at the last second if I thought I would need it based on the research I had undertaken.

3. There are two changes I would undertake to make game more realistic towards where I live, firstly I would change it so different plots of land cost more but were more likely to flood than other plots and also different plots would have a higher potential for reward by having a higher production level.  Secondly, one of the biggest risk management choices I have had is deciding where to work and if it is worth leaving a company/country to work in other locations.  It would be a good addition to have the choice of selling the current community and relocating to a new part of the planet to start all over, much like a video game I loved in my youth called "Theme Park".
