    <h1>Submission 1423 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8212999, session_user_id: 0d5ba026ae78503f122311b7a149396cd7de632d)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>At first it was difficult but I noticed the improvement as I
played along which made me think more strategically, things like: “I have
enough insurance now, let me develop more pods or upgrade this one, as the pods
were being developed I would utilize time for research on the comets and learn
more about their severity which would have an impact once there were hits”.
This correlation of actions told me that even if you plan ahead, there are
risks that would be completely unknown or unexpected and translate in that <i>deep uncertainty</i> as it was the case when
even though there was protection and insurance, the comet would increase its
severity suddenly beyond “the expected” causing a greater damage, this is
critical as you cannot maintain the telescope trained on the comet the whole
time as there is a need of balance in protection and benefit. </span></p>

<p>That would let all the advanced pods to a partial or total
destruction that would be beyond repair in the time allocated. I can see how
this relates to cases like big hurricanes (Haiti) where even if preparation and
insurance were available, the amount of shock produced would rend the
infrastructures almost to nothing.</p>

<p><span>As the planet increases the amount of pods and its
development, the risks are higher and higher because the destruction a comet
would bring at those stages would create another effect: <i>a set-back</i> so the level of progress that society had would be sent
back in time making the conditions of that social system go in a regression.</span></p>

<p><span>I played the game many times each time improving and reaching
higher levels, as I played more, the experience from previous games helped me made
better strategic decisions and I would value the importance of each area: research,
development, insurance and protection as well as wealth generation, if I were
to do some changes to the game, I would include a warning system that tells you
when the level of protection is way lower than the expected severity of the
comet above level 4 and as the research gets deeper, so the protection measures
can be better prepared to establish a <i>safe
zone</i> where you can reach a steady growth.</span></p>

<p>No doubt progress and set-backs belong to the road of
societies’ evolution and as members of them we have the tools to improve and
progress which can be the case of new forms of energy or understanding climate
change and natural disasters for increased prevention, but also we have the
responsibility of halting the set-backs we also create in war, pollution and
abuse of natural resources.</p>

<p><span>The name of Risk Horizon appeals to the reality of things in
environments with risks, as you can never stop preparing, because the risks
change and what helped in the past might not work in the present, the weather
is not constant and therefore  a risk
management plan for it has to be adaptable, predictions can be made, that would
be the base of research and analysis (studying the comets), improvements in
infrastructure, systems, plans and actions would reduce the impact or even
eliminate some risks at all ( vaccination or water sanitation) but there
remains also another truth: as in the game where you keep an eye on the horizon
for risks you should also keep an eye on the horizon for new options, in
analyzing the comets, the people from Alora could discover another world that
would enable them to shift their civilization there once Alora would no longer
have the conditions to sustain their society. <br /></span></p><p>
