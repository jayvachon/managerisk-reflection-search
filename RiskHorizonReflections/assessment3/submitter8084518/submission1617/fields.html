    <h1>Submission 1617 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8084518, session_user_id: 10f50fbddd2d5ddc66b06fe9b6146bcfebc67891)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The primary threat to Alora, the area we are protecting
in this game, is comet attack. Comet attacks would introduce a number of
shocks, such as flooding, financial collapse, unemployment and so forth.</p>

<p>Risk management under this circumstances is to grow
a community while preparing it for comet hits and coping with the damages and
threats ensuing by comets attacks.</p>

<p>Attempting to achieve this goal, my strategy is,
firstly, to construct two or three pods, and then upgrade them to a certain
level, therefore to form a relatively strong community connection as a kind of
insurance, so that the pods can be less damaged during disasters (comet hits).
On the other hand, I also insured them according to the severity and chance of
hit of the upcoming comets.</p>

<p><span>However, this strategy didn’t serve well. To begin
with, information of the comets are changeable. Sometimes it will cause severe
damage to Alora even the shown chance of hit is zero. On top of that, the
effectiveness of protection is hard to predict. Upgrading or connecting the
pods could raise protection level, as instructed by this game, however, there
is no clear index or data could show the protection taken by the decision maker
is strong enough or not. Moreover, buying insurance depending on the
information (severity, for instance) of the comets will sometimes make it too
late to get Alora insured if the shock is imminent.  Furthermore, be it monitoring the comets, upgrading
or connecting pods, buying insurance or repairing damaged pods, take times for
them to work. Last but not least, resources such as money, attention and time
are limited. These conflicts were getting more and more intensive when shocks reoccur more frequently. Struggling to balancing these trade-offs, I kept failing this game
at level 2.</span></p>

<p>Therefore, I played this game few more times and
altering the strategy. Gradually, I found that to prevent Alora from hitting by
comets is not the mission of risk management in this case, instead, lowering
the damage level is. Therefore, I lift the height of Alora according to the
severity and chance of hit of the comets in order to reduce the impact of flood
and waves. It turned out that proper protected pods are suffered less or even no
damage. Moreover, insured pods are cheaper to repair and this would help to manage
the conflict between constructing and upgrading pods and repairing fees. Thus,
I insured Alora at the beginning of every level of the game.</p>

<p>This game is a very good trial for us to check our
understanding of risk management as well as our ability to manage risk in a
given situation. However, I found this game would be more representative, if no
less interesting, if it could, firstly, have more tools for us to choose to manage shocks.
Building seawall could be a good way to prevent flood and waves that caused by
comet hitting other than just lifting the ground; secondly, introduce more social actors; and thirdly, introduce internal conditions such as population stress and some other kinds of risks, just to name some. </p><span>
