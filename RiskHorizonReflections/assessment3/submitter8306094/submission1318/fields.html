    <h1>Submission 1318 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8306094, session_user_id: 0c3fb0ed05a7d20afde2dd7181187f182ffc838f)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>RISK HORIZON GAME REFLECTION</p>

<p>The risk horizon game simulated the difficult tasks of Risk
Managers. Risk Management requires right judgment in balancing different
investments in confronting and coping with risks (research, protection and
insurance) with the limited available resources, finance and time. And, also
the investment in developing projects (the Pods).</p>

<p>My learning are:</p>

<p><span>1)     
</span>Insurance is affordable and cheaper at the early
stage of the game when risks are low and development of plots is in its early
stage. This is actually the reality, we got good insurance package when risks
are low. <br /></p>

<p><span>2)     
</span>Research is not accumulation of knowledge; it is
how we make use of the knowledge. In my few attempts of the game, I invested in
terms of time following comets and preparation, and these comets just miss. It
is important to identify the risks, measure which of these risks really post a
great threat and investment on the protection measures.</p>

<p><span>3)     
</span>Protection is not costly and sometimes it
increases our resources, I noticed it in the game. Sometimes when I do
protection, my resource diminishes but sometimes it increases. Which only
explains that it is very important to capitalize on protection initiatives and
projects. Actually, protection is a development investment that will generate
opportunities for income and employment, ecological development and protects
from hazard. Examples are the community assets like rebuilding mangrove
plantation, with a little investment of cost of labor and mangrove seedling
which is actually not a cost because it becomes income to the community,
improve aqua-marine eco-system, and can protect communities from storm surges.</p>

<p><span>4)     
</span>The right balance of research (knowledge) and
protection, in times of hazards like in the game, resulted to minimal to NO
DAMAGE. This is very important. Not all risks no matter how BIG, if we are
prepared, protected and with safety nets (insurance), the effects can be
reduced to a MINIMAL level.</p>

<p><span>5)     
</span>In the game.. I limit my development activities
in few POD, 3-4 POD, because I wanted to focus my resources to a few
development investments. I tried to have as much when I started the game, and
just ended up to few improvements because my resources are very limited. So,
when I only develop 3-5 Plots, I was able to plow in the resources and reached
a higher level of development  (with
leaves and flowers). Still, no matter how beautiful my plots are and I have
resources, I do not win in level 3. Resources, should be
use wisely in development programs that would really offer as much  “GOODS and SERVICES” to improve the life of
the communities. Resources unused “WASTE” . It should have been used for a meaningful endeavor  THAN BEING STORED OR IDLE.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I can improve the game, I would recommend that we can
include the concept of “resource generation”. When I played the game, I do not
understand how and when the resources are generated. I know..it is depleting
when I used it…but I do not know when it is coming and how much.</p>

<p>In reality, in risk management, the resource maybe be
limited, but the individuals, the households, the community, the government and
the international community can generate resources, pooled them together, and
becomes available to Risk Management. For Risk Managers, it is also important
to know when, where and how to generate resources. Initiatives have to be made
by the system. In the game, it just comes in as reward? </p></div>
