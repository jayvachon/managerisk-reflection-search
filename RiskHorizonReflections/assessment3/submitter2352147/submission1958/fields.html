<p>2. I tried to increase the Knowledge component of the risk management in my second attempt. <span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The major learning from the game was that </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">it was better to balance the trade-off between Protection and Insurance, once </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">adequate information is derived through Knowledge. The sequence in some </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">circumstances can follow as – acquire knowledge, obtain protection, obtain </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">insurance as trade-off. </span></p><p>Also learnt that risks cannot be fully avoided. Thus, insurance should be utilised as a tool to complement protection. This will maximise risk mitigation in circumstances of limited resources (limited available wealth in the game.)</p><p><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">3.</span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">     </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">The information about the Shock as used in the </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">game (Comet) is precise and certain. However, the place where I live, </span><span style="font-family:'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;">we have conflicting opinion amongst experts regarding certainty and accuracy of</span><br /></p><p>data and conclusions derived therefrom. Thus, game could be made closer to real-life situations if uncertainty element is added to Knowledge, Protection,
and Insurance aspects of risk management. One suggestion is to add another tab in Comet information, which gives the uncertainty in the given data. The game
could then utilise the previous outcomes and inform player about how the player performed relatively when uncertainty was added compared to when information was certain. </p><p>Balance is essential between adequate protection, knowledge and insurance. There is limitation in the amount of knowledge that will be available about Shock (Comet in the game) and uncertainty will always be present. Thus, trade-off between insurance and protection is crucial. However, the trade-off is dependent upon “internal and external environment” such as available wealth, behavioural biases such as choice and amount chosen for insurance.</p>
