    <h1>Submission 429 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 622377, session_user_id: 2de337c1e7fb6c8be52b900137019ad4b08d5c96)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I think the big lesson learned in the game was to achieve the healthy balance between acting in the prevention of risks and act in the development of "Alora" community.<br />An important step was the knowledge of the quantitative risk possibility. Clicking the comet and how much was the possibility that he hit the planet was crucial to assess whether there was a need to prepare for the eventual shock.<br />The speed and the order in which the comets and their greater or lesser danger of striking the planet with severity was important to my decision to continue building and updating the "pods" or spend money in preparation for a clash with high risk of severity.<br />I played many times, I tested several possibilities. The first few times I played almost no thought in community development; I bought the most expensive types of insurance and pretegi me as much as possible. Over time, I realized I was out of the goal of the game, I was protected from comets, but my planet "Alora" had almost no "pod".<div>Over time I realized there were comets with so little chance of colliding with the planet "Alora" there was no need to increase protection. In these moments, I took the opportunity to develop my community. When a comet appeared at high risk of shock and great severity, first I paid attention to his speed, then, when the comet was near, sought to buy insurance that were not so expensive, but to protect "Alora" against damage, and it increases the level of protection for the same level of the comet.<br />One of the great lessons I learned in the game is that protection needs to be in proportion to the risk. No use being very protected for possible risk and have no resources to community development.<br /><div>It is hard to think of something to add to the game. He is very good. Makes one think of how to assess the risks, how to prepare, how the community can react after a problem. In my country, we have to live with another type of risk, which is the political risk. In most cases, you can learn how to prepare for a risk, for example: summer rains. They occur every year, with more or less intensity, at the same time. In mior of the time, mayors and governors have financial and time resources to at least minimize its effects, however, almost nothing is done.</div><div>I have no idea how to include the political risk in the game, but it's one of the things that interfere with the management of risks in my country.</div></div></div>
