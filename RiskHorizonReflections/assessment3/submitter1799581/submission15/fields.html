    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Horizon Game - A perspective on managing risk in real life<br /><br />The risk horizon game involved making decisions to build pods with the ability to upgrade them, research potential dangers, obtain insurance and even protection in the event of a natural disaster. As you succeed against the first wave of attacks, you progress to the next levels, the speed of the disasters are much more quicker so you'll need to really think on your feet if you want to succeed.<br /><br />The choices I made for this was to (1) always insure my pods in the beginning - this would help me mitigate any losses I would face. I already know that time is against me so if I cannot research the disaster in time, at least my losses will be minimal when they hit. This worked really well for me and most of the time, I experienced 0% damage to the pods as a result. The (2) thing I would do is research the comets, usually if there are more than one, I will click on all to see which comet has the highest chance to hit and is the most severe and then research this comet as long as I can. Lastly I would protect all my pods after a quick research to ensure the damage is minimal. This strategy and sequence worked very well for me.<br /><br />However, if I had to play the game again, I think I would also donate alot of money to upgrade the pods a lot sooner. I notice upgrading them generates a lot of the needed revenue I need to insure and protect myself. I believe that protection and insurance are very expensive so its important that there is sufficient money to protect your pods for more severe comets. The main thing I learned from this game is that before you make any decision, you need to always insure yourself first, then research the risk and then finally protect yourself based on what you researched. Doing it anyway around can be very costly, such as researching first and then insuring as the disaster may strike you whilst you are still researching.<br /><br />Lastly, to upgrade the game I would add water drainage system device. Yes the comet will cause floods, but protection does not only have to be on the pod, It must drain the floods otherwise you have two problems instead of one.<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
