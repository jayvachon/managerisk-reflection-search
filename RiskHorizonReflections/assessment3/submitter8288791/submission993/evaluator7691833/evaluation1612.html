    <div class="field-value">The strength of this reflection is in the realization that came from playing the game and the ability to describe how the game play strategy had to change.  I also, enjoyed that this reflection related the learning to a real situation in the writers home country.  The reflection could be improved by discussing the timing related to preparedness as shown in the example of question one.  Overall, this was a very good reflection.</div>
