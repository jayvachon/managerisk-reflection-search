    <h1>Submission 993 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8288791, session_user_id: 43635d580ba4394c269e3c9fb18d6421d1a19dd6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Honestly, this game is truly
interesting, especially it provides and simplifies all the knowledge about risk
management through Luminator legacy model. I think the risk management plays a
vital role in this game, consists of gaining firstly all the practical
knowledge that can help and using the tools in game to protect my village,
secondly preparing the protection for the situation that the comets hit and
destroy legacy through clicking and holding button to raise the village,
finally it is a process of confronting the risk and limit damages by purchasing
the insurance. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Admittedly, in the first time I
played this game, I thought that if the legacy has all its necessary
protections as same as the level of severity of comets, when the comet comes,
my village would not be destroyed and become more vulnerable either, so I just
used the protection tool, did not care about the community connection and
insurance, and spent money on building pots and develop and upgrade them. And
the comets comes to prove that all my speculations were wrong and make me
understand deeply about risk management. Although you have an expensive or
careful protection for your treasure, it can not prevent all the shocks when
they happen. For example, after my pots were ruined by comets, it costed about
147$ per one for restoration and rehabilitation, while I just had to pay for
47$ per one if I bought an insurance packet before. This underestimation made
me have to face with the risk chain when I did not have enough money and time
for my legacy wealth. For the second and third times, I focused on the coordination
combined research, protection and insurance, and of course community connection
to reduce risks from comets as much as possible. Unsurprisingly, the powers of
these factors helped me reach level 5 before I have to get out due to
electricity outage haha. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>In fact, I understand that risk
chain is caused by not only external enviroment, in this case is comets hitting
the legacy, but also internal conditions but honestly I did not realized the
risk deriving from these reasons in game. If I have chance to develop more this
game, I would pose the problems that the pots could be degraded, the community
connections could not be managed effectively or so on, this game will become
more reality and appealing. For many years, Viet Nam did not have any chances to
embarke with other countries due to the limited international integration
policy of government, and anecdotal evidence shows that the risks come from
external enviroment could be avoided by this policy. But now, I think the
government and people in Viet Nam have changed little by little to accept the
risk from outside to pursue further goals, pursue further opportunities. Before
doing that, we have to try to solve and control the risk problems derive from
internal environment that are not paid more attention for many years.</p></div>
