    <h1>Submission 1073 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6817548, session_user_id: 1951ee97a0bb5db347f3025865c3f8d31df82442)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>Risk management was an important tool in development in the game.A proper balance of insurance, knowledge and protection was needed to succeed the level.The more I took risk the more I developed.Like in real world research was the best part.I invested in upgradation when risk was less.But sometimes the crisis could not have been prevented so I needed a proper protection and insurance.As I advanced level I needed more protection.Sometimes I ignored the risks which had low probability to occur which led to more development Â but I soon realized that it was still necessary to take precautionary measure even if their odds were less. As I advanced in the game or when the risk were higher I needed more protection.So the development was less but it helped me lot in further levels.</div><div>	When I played the game for the first time I had bought too many plots so I had less money to spend on up gradation of plot buying insurance and protection.I did more research on the crisis in my further attempt.The main thing I learned from this game was to use my resources carefully.Research was the best option but I had to be prepared for the inevitable crisis so I needed a balance between protection and insurance.And protection do cost some money which could be spend for short term development but in a long run it's profit margin is overwhelming.</div><div>	The one thing I would have done differently in my version of game is to allow a particular plot to protected more than other because according to me in real world we care more about things which are more important to us like in this situation a certain plot which is more developed or gives more output its priority for safety is more than low yielding or underdeveloped plot so i would have added that feature.</div></div>
