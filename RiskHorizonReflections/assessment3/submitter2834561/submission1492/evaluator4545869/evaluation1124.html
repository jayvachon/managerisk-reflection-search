    <div class="field-value">Key Strength: The writer was able to articulate his thoughts very well and he was able to internalize the game experience into everyday life.  

One thing I thought would make the reflection better is  to mention briefly the choice or trade-off made between risk and reward. For example, not all meteors (risks) cause damage, one is able to know through the Color Indicator. Green means there is no imminent threat to development, one could then let go of the Slider by not raising the Island or when  Red Color appears signalling danger; development must be protected by raising the Island or buying insurance to mitigate property of loss caused by flooding. In other words, risks can be measured, and with objective measurement, risk appetite could be determined. </div>
