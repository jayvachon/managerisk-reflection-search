    <h1>Submission 1821 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8180153, session_user_id: 23330c17d55cc3df6fff5dd8f155a269cb829de6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the horizon game I have learned the challengeÂ  to balance between knowledge, protection and insurance as the tools for preparation. there must be a balance to measure the opportunity for gain or loss when using the tools. It is not easy unless the study of the factors have been gathered and past experience involved. I played the game more than once, the different things I have tried building few pods and developing them rather than building many at level 1, this meant to increase the value of the pods.In another trial I learned to study the severity of the meteors although sometimes the occurrence did not match the predictions and hence affected the preparation. I tried more protection another round but it was not worthy the resources used were not producing in return. In all these trials didn't forget the insurance cover. for the insurance cover to work well the severity of the hit a greater consideration.To propose a change in this game I would lower the costs of developing the pods once built. High costs set to develop a pod once built imply a greater loss incase of a meteor hit thus protection may take a greater part. Protection do not pave the way to pursue opportunities in some ways especially when time becomes a major constraint as it was in the horizon game.<br /><pre></pre><pre>cte</pre><br /><br /><br /></div>
