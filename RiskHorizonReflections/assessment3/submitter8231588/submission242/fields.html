    <h1>Submission 242 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8231588, session_user_id: 95c08127fd71dcc4ad02715118b2cf3f131cb660)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1. Risk management plays a central role in the game. One
needs to find the right balance between investing for development and investing
in the different risk management instruments (protection and insurance). Some other efforts such as research/knowledge and community connection are
not directly competing with investment, but they compete for attention. </p>

<p>Risk preparation affects development by diverting resources
from investment in additional units of upgrading existing units. On the longer
term, though, risk preparation is necessary to avoid recurrent damages to the
existing investments.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>2. I played a first time and lost at level 4 because I spent
too much on raising the village to the maximum height. More importantly, I did
not write the code I was given after losing at level 4, thinking I would have
another chance at attempting the same level. Only after clicking on “restart”
did I realize that it had meant the end of the world and civilization as we
know it. The second time, I invested less in raising the village and was doing
well until a monster comet pretty much destroyed my village during level 4. So
I lost again at level 4, but this time I remembered to write the code. The main
lesson is that one need to find the right balance between the different risk
management instruments… and I guess also to write down the codes because you
never know when your civilization might end.</p>

<p>3. I would add stats at the end of each level, that could
provide the opportunity from learning from the game. One could even think of
posting the stats of the best games online so that people can analyze the
strategies adopted. The link between research and community connection is not obvious. The community connection phase is actually a little annoying and breaks the game-play, diverting the attentiong from the main phase of the game play. </p><span>
