    <h1>Submission 875 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7783000, session_user_id: 53615ea860505522cb319ea0ecc233a605a54ab3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1: The game risk horizon included elements of
risk management in that it included the requirement to take advantage of
development opportunities to build and upgrade pods as much as possible while
at the same time ensuring that you were increasing your resilience to shocks or
potential risks when they occurred.  It was clear that funds spent on
minimizing the risk i.e. insurance and raising the island had limited value
when you exposure was only small or another way of putting it is that you can
spend more money and lose development potential trying to stop the shocks form
affecting you than the cost when you are hit by a asteroid.  As you have
greater value of infrastructure and the shocks starting coming more frequently
in the higher levels then spending time and money protection and insurance
becomes more important.  By using the time when shocks were not frequent
to raise the island and ensure enough cash was in the bank to buy insurance
ensured that once all of the effort was required just to prevent damage (i.e.
research) and repairing the damage that was there.<span><br /><br /><span>2:  After the first time i learnt that there was limited reward from insuring when i had few assets and the risk of hit was low in the first couple of rounds.  I also learnt that in the early rounds as it was not as hard to win you could build up your resilience by raising the island this would then help you in the later rounds this seems to make sense as when you have a small building it is easy to lift it up out of the floods but when you have a large town it is much more expensive to build flood banks or similar.  It was also important i learnt in the subsequent games to plan at the end of the round not to build anything so you had enough cash at the start of the following round to buy insurance in the later rounds.  </span></span></p><p><span><span>3:  I would add increased benefit from each time that you build linkages between communities after a hit as from my experience the more times that you go through shocks as a community the better the coping mechanisms become and systems to deal with problems.  By this i mean that each time you build linkages you get more protection from each linkage that you say after ten times building five lots the value of protection increases by 10%.  </span></span></p></div>
