    <div class="field-value">Strength = it's clear that you played the game from your description and that you understand the risk management concepts presented within.  One thing to make this reflection better = the wording read as a very technical description rather than a personal reflection; my opinion is that it would have been better (easier to follow, more engaging) to tell the story of your interaction with the game (especially for #2) than the objective descriptions that you gave above.</div>
