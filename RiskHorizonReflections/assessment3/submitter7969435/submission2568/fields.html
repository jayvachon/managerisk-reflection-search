    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. I had to choose between development of the island in constrast to preperation and coping  with the risk of the flood destroying my farms.More precisely this ment to think about how spending money, generated by the farms, for insurance, protection, information, reparing buildings or the development of new plants.<br />Of course, in the short run the investments in protection, insurance or information lowered the income and did not generate money directly. The preparing mesaures showed their usefullness in the long run. I played the game twice - a to strong focus on the development of new firms was diminished by the horrend reperation costs.<br /><br />2. My strategie the first time was to rely strongly on development and insurance, because the insurance didn't get costlier when making more risk. This didn't pay off. The strategie testet after this was to focus on each measure mentioned above in the same proportion. This was better. I learned that you should really use the concepts of the course. You need every tool, which risk management in theory suggests. I learned that insurance really can drive to moral hazard. If I played again, I would focus more on information. This tool I used to little.<br /><br />3.I really was surprised how this few, simple rules could make a game such fun. For a game for my country (Germany) I woul suggest the following adaptions:<br /><br />-Risk could be price risk (not natural catastrophes)<br />-Research could be market research<br />-One of the triggers for development could be the base-rate-policy and the monetary base<br />.One other meaure could be the public spending in order to stimulate cosumtion<br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
