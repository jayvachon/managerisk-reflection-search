    <div class="field-value">The discussion point about the link between cost of insurance and mitigation to community wealth is good.  Community wealth is essential for growth and development of a community.  This was one of  the many messages of the Risk Horizon game.  The balance between insurance and pod development (upgrades) is important to cover the repair cost,but what about insurance role in protection. The more protection available the less damage to the pods and insurance cost is reduce..  What about knowledge in understanding comets, there was no mention of knowledge in the reflection. Knowledge reduces the uncertainties.</div>
