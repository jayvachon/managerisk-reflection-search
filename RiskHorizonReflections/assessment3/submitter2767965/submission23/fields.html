    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Comparing the cost-effectiveness of preparing for risk with that of coping with its consequences is one of the important trade-offs that must be assessed. The choice between these actions depends in part on how the (certain) costs of preparing for risk
compare to the (often uncertain) benefits of doing so.12 In addition, risk management requires considering different risks and the relative need of preparing for each of them (box 2). Given limited resources, setting priorities and making choices is both
unavoidable and necessary. For instance, a family living in a violence-ridden community faces safety, health, and property risks and must choose how to allocate its limited budget to protect and insure against each of these risks. Likewise, a small country
prone to torrential rains and also exposed to international financial shocks must decide how much to spend in flood prevention infrastructure and how much to save to counteract the effects of financial volatility. When risks are taken on voluntarily in
the pursuit of opportunity, another trade-off emerges: expected returns must be weighed against the potential losses of a course of action. This trade-off is intensified when a higher return is possible only if more risk is accepted. That is often the
case with financial investments, where a lower yield is characteristic of a more secure position, and higher yields with riskier positions. 13 A risk-return trade-off may also be perceived for certain development actions: for instance, public opinion
and certain experts may link the pursuit of higher economic growth with lower environmental protection or higher inequality.14 Although this and other risk-return trade-offs may not be present, risk management entails addressing them as a legitimate possibility.
Risk management involves not only considering trade-offs but also taking synergies into account. These can make both preparation for and consequences of risk less costly. They can also diminish risks and increase expected benefits. These “winwin situations
are widespread and should be emphasized— which is not to say that they are costless or always easy to implement. Investments in nutrition and preventive health, for example, make people more productive while reducing their vulnerability to disease.15
Similarly, improvements in the business environment, such as streamlining regulations and improving access to credit, can induce the enterprise sector to become more dynamic and grow more quickly, while also making it more resilient to negative shocks.
This is all from my side. Thank you very much for evaluating this!</div>
