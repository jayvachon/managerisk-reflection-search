    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the clarity of it. The details embedded in the essay makes it easy to follow the writer's flow of ideas. The content of the essay was also well thought out. I think it would be better if the essay was written in a more formal set up with less use of the parenthesis to convey additional comments or thoughts.</div>
