    <div class="field-value">The approach given is proper way to illustrate how  differentes components of Risk Management can be used to benefit the community.  

It was proved across the game and the reflection that the lack of resources and differents obstacles need to be confronted.  So that,  is imposible to make a progress without resources, and that is why in the game was necessary to make decisions considering the means given strategically in order to get welfare for the region and the community. 
In addition, I would say that from the reflection is clear that the benefits of risk management tends to be cost and it is beneficial to pay in advance .  Beneficial to the group of people that decide pay in advance and to asume the risk in case of predicted future events. 

2. What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
One aspect thet would have made this reflection better is the fact that it must have been made as an assay and not aswering each question individually.   
Apart from that I think it was a very good analysis.
