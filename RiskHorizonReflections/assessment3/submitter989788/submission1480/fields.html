    <h1>Submission 1480 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 989788, session_user_id: 12ed6d916ab97826c1bb6c4abd5696b393e948a2)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The fundamental of the game is about risk management,during the process of playing , it was about building pods and protecting them against risk of  elements coming from the milky-way , building  pods is cost expensive and making research to visualize danger coming from outside is as well cost expensive , it was important to leverage the construction area up which is costly as well , the trade-off is to find a way to build and recognize the fact we cannot spare the pods from being crashed since we are vulnerable, the only way to mitigate this effect is to buy insurance for that purpose , higher is better .
Subsequently from the game analyzing , it comes to mind that the process of development in general is risky affected by external events predictable by planned research , some events are  inevitable and impact can be reduced by good preparation in term of research  and alleviate cost of rebuild infrastructure via insurance.
Whenever you play the game one more time you acquire insight and knowledge how to be prepared for next events and how to manage your existing resources for a better allocation .First time playing , one trend would be to  try to grow the pots farm consistently with all the existing resources , neglecting the fact that all this effort can be vain if one asteroid come and destroyed everything , further game sessions illustrate the fact that the better to cope with this trade-off is to balance the allocation in all the existing patterns , this process will delay the development process for sure but at the end you will have your farm set .
In my place , we are living in a area affected by risks such as , earthquake , hurricane ,disease and other systemic patterns.I would modify the game in such a way to add another module which will consist of a risk  of shaking the island even a level of ten has bee reached by protection maneuver , this will have conducted to a considerable reduction of the GDP and other competitive advantages win through time . </div>
