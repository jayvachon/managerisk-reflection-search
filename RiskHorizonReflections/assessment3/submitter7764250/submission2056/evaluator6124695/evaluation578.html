    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is a good understanding of setting the priorities to minimize the risk and potentially reduce the impact if/when disaster strikes.  The level of detail and explanation was outstanding, in addition the very intuitive recommendations to improve the quality of the game added even more realism to the scenario and understanding of the factors involve in managing risk.  The student's submission was clear, concise, and articulate, and therefore I not have a significant input to make his/her reflection better.  Overall, nice job.</div>
