    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I administrated more thinking about the goal, in which for that I needed more improved pods in order to raise faster the bar. Than went the knowledge of the meteors, and the insurance to take for ease the recovery, the protection was the last thing I dealed with, but I asured to keep it balanced.<br />In second round, I think actually that I wouldn't do it to much diferently, as I almost got to level 6 this way. I just think I should be faster about the decisions to make, cause I lost too much time sometimes thinking what was better (since I played just once). So I learned more about taking the right decisions at short time, but thinking about the future upcoming events and how to manage diferent parameters of risk.<br />I think that about risk management, the game is quite complete and as actually, even I don't achieving the sixth level, I though it quite easy. Just to improve something, I'd put some additional events out of our knowledge, think that we couldn't measure or expect.</div>
