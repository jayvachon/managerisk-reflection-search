    <h1>Submission 78 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8043701, session_user_id: 1b9561784737a0df3c0cc33018b2c711f9878930)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Having to
protect the community of ‘Alora’ from falling comets gave me the chance not
only to avoid large risks on people’s lives but also gave me the opportunity to
prepare and cope with that risks in order to grow and develop a healthy community.
This is where risk management can be the tool for development by taking the
appropriate choices.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">Having played
the game more than once, I started realizing that mostly boosting protection
was not the solution to overcome the floods. So I began with gaining knowledge
and measuring the risks from comets in terms of probability and impact. That was
the key because it made me more risk taker by matching the level of protection
to the minimum giving me the time to develop my community bonds because
connected neighbors helped me when it was needed. When protection itself was
not enough, insurance helped me when it needed. The trade-off here was that
insurance out weighted the costs by repairing them quicker, at the minimum and
replacing lost development.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">So having
gained after some time a balance between knowledge, protection and insurance, it
unleashed the opportunity to grow my community and allocate more resources for
development as I was going to a higher level and be more confident to cope with
future shocks.<span>  </span>The main things that I learned
from the game were that even in a game where simplified rules of risk
management are applied, even that kind of large systemic risks as falling
comets can be overcome and prosperity can be gained. The risk of inaction and
failure would not let do anything. Moreover by talking calculated risks,
reduction measurements and sharing resources with insurance and community made
me thinking that preparation and coping with risk cannot be distinguished and
are key interrelated components of a good risk management framework.</span></p>

<span style="font-size:11pt;line-height:115%;font-family:Calibri, 'sans-serif';" lang="en-us" xml:lang="en-us">If I was tasked to play that game depended on my
internal and external conditions I would add risk transfer mechanisms with the
help of the international community since the current systemic risks of recent financial
crisis in my country arise mainly from government failures, corruption and
distortionary policies. So pooling resources, expertise and coordination would
be a grateful help in order for both systems helping each other and overcome the
problems.</span><strong></strong></div>
