    <div class="field-value">It looks like the student has experience of risk management and so was able to relate the games concepts to real life - this was good. I also really liked the reference to risk management being cyclical and thought the piece showed good reflection on how an individual's approach made a difference (how risk adverse a person is). I would have liked to have seen better use of the terms used in the course as this would have made the analysis easier to understand.Some further information on the equations and terms used that have not been covered by the course would also have been helpful to ensure understanding of their significance.</div>
