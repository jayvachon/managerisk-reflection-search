    <h1>Submission 1056 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3232611, session_user_id: 8537f62a5e6f83cac7700b754d1696f27cb5f129)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In real life, risk management plays an integral role in order to achieve the desired goals by an individual or a community or even a nation. The game, gave us an opportunity to achieve some specific goals while at the same time manage resource constraints along with other priorities. In the initial part of the game, I laid emphasis on insurance and basic development, in order to achieve a balanced and sustainable growth. Later on based on the research information available whenever there was time available or a less impact risk (could be coped up with minimal damages), I focused on higher level development.<br /><br />After playing the game for the first time I focused on insuring and protecting myself and at the same time making sure I had the basic development in place to capitalize and undertake higher grade developmentÂ eventually.<br /><br />One thing that I would like to add to the game would be the opportunities option, like in some case there could be an opportunity where if the risk is hedged efficiently, it can in turn be used to take advantage of the situation, for example on successfully hedging against 5 (or a some other threshold no) meteor impacts, an additional energy (wealth) is provided as a reward to enhance the rate of growth.</div>
