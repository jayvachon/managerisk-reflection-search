    <div class="field-value">This reflection did an excellent job recognizing how the value of insurance changes depending on the level of development. It was an insightful reflection that pointed out how needs for protection, insurance and knowledge are dynamic and change along with the level of development. It also made a strong point about how the game could be improved by adjusting the cost of insurance based on technology or other factors.

The reflection could also address how the player applied different decisions based on the level of threat posed by the comets in the game, both based on the severity and also the chance of a strike. 

Great job!</div>
