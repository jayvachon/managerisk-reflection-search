    <div class="field-value">Key Strength - Good reflection on the trade-offs or balance the gamer has to achieve with regard to knowledge, protection, and insurance. It's interesting that you placed a focus on knowledge - I did the opposite where I focused on buying the most expensive insurance and then taking the time to focus on development and protection instead.

One thing that I think would make this reflection better - I wish you expanded on your point for Q3 - why do you want to know the religious beliefs and cultural background of the people in the area? </div>
