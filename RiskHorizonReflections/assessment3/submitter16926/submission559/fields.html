    <h1>Submission 559 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 16926, session_user_id: 1ce81515665b16804ecf06d81deca30f7cd45c0c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk
management in the game consisted of using resources to mitigate the impact of
the comet. There were three ways to do so: 1) buying insurance; 2) researching
on the comet; and 3) putting the colony on a higher plane. The trade-offs
surround time and resources available to upgrade/build the existing colony.
Preparation for risks helped the gamer to actually complete the level. That is if
not well protected, the colony will suffer massive damage which will
significantly impair the ability of the gamer to complete the game.</p>

<p>If
I were to play the game again, I would probably spend more time in the initial
stages learning more deeply about the trade-offs involved and the
function/effectiveness of the three ways to risk management. The main thing
that I learnt from the game was that risk management is important and requires
careful thought. In addition, due to the uncertainties and various constraints,
one would need good planning and insights.</p>

<p><span>If
I were to develop a new version of the game, I would add more variety to the
game, including the environment, where sources of risks can be multiple.
Furthermore, with every given level, I would have expanded the land mass of the
colony.</span></p></div>
