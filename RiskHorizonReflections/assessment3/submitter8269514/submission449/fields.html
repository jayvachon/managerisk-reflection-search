    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The
Risk Horizon game was a very practical application of the intricacies we have
learned about risk management over the course of the last two weeks. At first,
there was a certain difficulty I faced in being able to handle the multiple activities
on-screen simultaneously against the ticking timer. What’s important is, that
this is actually how it should feel while facing risks as it is clearly a
possibility of loss, an uncertainty. The three main aspects of risk management
being confronting, preparing and coping with the effects were represented by Knowledge
(Research), Insurance, Protection. When I invested too much into Insurance I
was invariably suffering losses but on a smaller scale. The development bar
kept sliding lower thereby often bringing me back to square one and posing as a
constant hindrance to the development. When I focused too much on Research I
had to select the comets and I wasn’t able to upgrade my pods, which was again
futile from the bigger perspective. For me, what worked was making sure I used
the Protection bar right away so as to make sure I was preparing for future
contingencies.</p>

<p>Achieving
level 5 in the game was only after repeated efforts and of course, trial and
error. At one point I was so engrossed in clearing the level I lost focus about
making sure my choices were sensible or geared towards achieving a balance. Only
after playing the game a few times I started upgrading my pods instead of just
continuously planting new ones. At the start of every level I lingered for about
a minute on the protection bar in-between upgrading my pods. This shielded me
from the comets of low-medium severity. I also invested in medium insurance
because I felt that I was spending enough on protection as it is. The moments
when I was waiting for my green bar to fill I would research the comets just as
a back-up measure. I learnt that risk management isn’t just about balancing
policies and corrective actions or depending on insurance. If you can
prioritize and assess the circumstances it’ll go a long way in the process of
risk aversion and reduction.</p>

<p>If
there was some addition I could make to the game it would be in the form of
more than one type of risk. After a point of time the comets didn’t damage my
pods at all because of my high protection level. Realistically, this can’t always
be the case. There are numerous factors that play a role which determine the
extent to which a risk affects a particular place in spite of the measures
taken in advance to prepare for them. The place where I come from, many types
of risks are not dealt or managed effectively because of ignorance and lack of
political and governmental interferences. The imminent possibility of loss is
well-known to people but there is no communal spirit to unite and take
preventive actions until it is too late.</p></div>
