    <h1>Submission 719 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4764764, session_user_id: 42e8bafe717f41f21a143a66e9a8b6b747f838a3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>The
role of risk management in the game:</p>

<p>On
the one hand, we want to build as much as we can the community, but there is a
danger</p>

<p>Of comets
destroying the assets built.</p>

<p>Therefore
we should invest part of the resources in  knowledge,
protection, and insurance.</p>

<p>The
knowledge help us to learn about the severity of the threat and the probability
to get heart.</p>

<p>When
the threat is severe with reasonable probability or thereat is medium with high
</p>

<p>Probability
we should get prepared by buying protection and/or insurance.</p>

<p>The
protection helps when the shock happens, the insurance helps to mitigate the
damages</p>

<p>After
the shock  already happened.</p>

<p>We
have to find the balance between building more houses and preparing for disaster
on</p>

<p>The
other hand, putting too much resources on preparing for risk will not allow to
enlarge the community, so the strategy is to build as much as possible and when
comes a threat as described above – buy protection and insurance, divide the
money  on both, but not more</p>

<p>Than
30% of the assets.</p>

<p>The
research is mandatory in order the asses the severity of the threat.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If I
played the game only once I'd purchase more protection and insurance relatively
to</p>

<p>many
repetitions of the game, since in a one game play a shock might destroy all the
assets</p>

<p>even
when the probability is not high, so the mean(expectancy) is the same, but
standard</p>

<p>deviation
is much larger for a 1 game play. That's why a risk averse person would buy a
lot</p>

<p>of
insurance and protection, to lower the risk, but also the gain.</p>

<p>On
the other hand – with many repetitions the statistics will bring us close to
the mean,</p>

<p>And
 in one of the games to a large gain more
than the average.</p>

<p>The
learning from the game: invest in knowledge, buy reasonable protection/insurance
</p>

<p>For
protection and recovery.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>If
I could change one thing in the game:</p>

<p>I'd
add a more direct measure to asses the quantity of the threat , the value of
protection</p>

<p>And
its benefit and the exact cover y of the insurance, this would help the player
to</p>

<p>Get
a reasonable decision, based on data.</p>
