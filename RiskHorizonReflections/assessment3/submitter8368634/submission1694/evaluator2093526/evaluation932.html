    <div class="field-value">Strengths: Good account of game dynamics, including a detailed analysis of how to play the game optimally.

Weaknesses: Too few examples linking the principles taught in the game to real life. I appreciate your comments about Jharkhand, however it would have been better if you had connected the example to the game using the high level principles of knowledge, protection, insurance and coping and described the situation in detail.</div>
