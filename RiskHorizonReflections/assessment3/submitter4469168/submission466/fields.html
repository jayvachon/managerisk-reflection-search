    <h1>Submission 466 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4469168, session_user_id: 1c415d11d9db3fc0e0c3ffd4521e31ec0c726cde)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In terms of knowledge i did some research, as for protection I was lifting up the surface. In terms of insurance I was using an insurance policy covering 75% of the damage that was being done. I have played the game for a few times, and every time I learn something new, firstly I didn't know about the research, and after the first time when I only did some insurance, I have starting doing some research also. The next couple of times besides insuring and researching I have learned to do some protection also, which included lifting up the surface of the planet so that when the meteor hit it would not cause a lot of damage to my objects. Every next time that I played the game, I firstly went researching after that protection and if it is not enough than I also insured my property. It payed of really well.Â </div>
