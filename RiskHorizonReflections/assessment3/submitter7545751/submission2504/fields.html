    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><b>About Game and risk management...</b><br />
As a Luminator of Alora, we used risk management to develop our community in ways that balance risk preparation and healthy Development. As the shocks were here materialized by the falling comets, risk management enabled us, through benefit-cost analysis, to assess the situation and took rigorous decision to master the game.
As in real life, Research, Protection, and Insurance cost precious resources that implies you make choices.
For instance, the protection to raise our island was only efficient on a long term run because it slows down so much our development that it had to be implemented in the beginning of the game. On the contrary, it seems to be useless to buy insurance at the very beginning of the game because you won't have so much to repair in case of disaster and furthermore, the cost of the insurance will reduce your capacity to develop rapidly. About research, our decision was less a matter of time than a risk assessment. Indeed, risk is the couple of severity and probability so, if both were high we had to “invest” in knowledge (time for the game) to protect ourself through community connection. On the contrary, if both were low, it might have been a waste of time to invest here in research instead of growing our community. 
In Alora as in real world, at short term, the preparation for risk cost us some resources, which were obviously not available to build pods, and ultimately slowed down our development. But at long term, risk management improved our capacity to reduce the losses and recover after a disaster.<br /><br /><b>About lessons learned...</b><br />
Having played the game more than once, after the first time, I improved my strategy in prioritizing the type of protection I used. Thus, in the end, I systematically analysed each comet to asset their dangerousness and I used the first insurance somewhere in the middle of the first round once I have built pod significantly.
it is necessary to take risks to grow the community and the risk of inaction (no research, no protection...) is the worst option at long term.
To successfully achieve an healthy development with this game, it is essential to manage the risk in a proactively (with protection and insurance) and a systematically (knowledge of the comets) way.<br /><br /><b>About game improvement...</b><br />
If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game, I would propose to introduce a part of team work in the game among MOOC's participants to enhance the fact that, in risk management, decision of individuals impacts in some ways community's destiny. <br /></div>
