    <h1>Submission 393 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7980703, session_user_id: f4b380dd104d95fcbf178cac3a45e97eeea4bd83)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.The
role of risk management in this game was to achieve the highest level of
development as possible, in a short time and given the possibility to mix
knowledge, protection and insurance.</p>

<p>In
other words, we can achieve development only if we keep the right balance
between:  protection, insurance and research/knowledge.  Practically,
while my main goal was the development of the pods by handling protection,
research/knowledge and insurance, there was this other matter  that was
very important in this game: reducing damages, or even better, avoiding them. By
this, I didn’t waste time with recovery and I gained it for development.</p>

<p><span> In my opinion, too much time and too many
resources used in preparation for risks affects the development on a long term.
We must never forget our main goal and the fact that most of the hazards are
inevitable. We have to be prepared for shocks and manage them. </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p>2.I
must admit I played the game many times. My biggest mistake was actually the
fact that I either kept my protection on a too high level or my insurance or my
research; and let’s not forget the fact that there were times when I was
concentrating only on upgrading my pods.  </p>

<p>I
realized that risk management requires all of them as a perfect mix. My
strategy was to place all the pods in the first level of the game, buy a
minimum insurance, ensure a minimum and constant protection, monitor the comets
and do the required research equal to the severity of the hit. As I passed to
the next levels, I continued by upgrading my pods and took care, proportionally,
of the other variables. </p>

<p>The
main things I learned from this game is that risk management is a very
important tool for development and that we must be prepared for risks, confront
them and cope with their effects.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>3.<span>The fact that I
liked the most about this game is that the pods were always productive and  there was no worry about financial resources.
 In a real business environment we confront
with bankruptcy, failure or insolvency. In order to make the game more
realistic and provocative I would add some financial engineering aspects . So,
when you run out of resources you will have the alternative  to appeal at loans or external financing and
find intelligent ways to reimburse.</span> Also, to deepen the game I think I would
add environmental and social challenges. Another propose would be to have the
possibility to play the game as a team, and even assign specific tasks for each
of the members.</p>
