    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
Risk management in the Risk Horizon game was to
develop the community to the best one can bearing in mind the risk of meteors that
might hit the buildings and pods that we gradually create. I reached level 3
and failed afterward as I did not manage to develop my pods in level 3 within
the frame of time given. The difficult tradeoffs I have been faced with are
either to build new constructions or to put the same money in insurance, or
maybe communicating the pods together or maybe upgrading them. to prepare for
the risk I made full insurance of my building after reaching a reasonable level
so that the damage could not wipe the entire building and I was also watching the
sky and watching meteors by increasing research that increased the early
warning system.</p>

<p>2.      
If I played the game again I will study more the
meteors, since my major issue is not development, as I reached acceptable
levels, but the meteors hitting my buildings and not enough insurance to cover
the repair, as well as time lost in repair. I learned that learning further on
the potential threat helps us to face it more strongly; however we need to have
the financial resources as well to lead the development and mitigate risk
without blocking the development.</p>

<p>3.      
If I was a developer of this game I would
certainly add an option where I can add further insurance. In fact to mitigate
risk insurance is important. As we know the premium insurance in the game still
have a liability cap in each phase and it would be great to be able to further
increase this insurance, because tis is the main way to cope with risk when it
occurs.  Research tool is a good tool for
understanding the risk, however the visuals would have been changed to include
an action point not only knowledge. </p></div>
