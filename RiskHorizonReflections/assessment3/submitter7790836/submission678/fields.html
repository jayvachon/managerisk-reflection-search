    <h1>Submission 678 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7790836, session_user_id: 6e21a5bfa2f1984730229c0d1bcef0fd4f0f529a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The most important role that I learned from the game is to wisely distributed the money between creating the pods and saving money for insurance. Time was also a factor, as I had to spend some time doing research. The trade-off at the beginning was that i couldn't spend too much time creating pods, as I have to same some money to use it for insurance, and the level thing on the right that consumed a lot of money. Interestingly, as I was increasing levels, money wasn't an issue anymore (i guess this is an example of a developed country), and actually, i failed to pass to level 5, because i was over-protecting too much, when I should have use the money to upgrade the pods. I guess that my main outcome from this game is that at the beginning, when you were 'poor', it was way more difficult to balance my budget between creating pods and protecting from the meteorites, but as I was getting more money, it wasn't too difficult, and actually i was spending money on protection even if there were no meteorites on sight or the risk was quite low. <br />I played the game twice, the second time, I didn't over-spend in protection, specially when i was getting close to level 2. I put more budget on upgrading pots, I guess i felt 'safe' once I bought the most expensive insurance, and that allowed me to focus more on upgrading the pods. <br />If I could add or change one more thing, i'll probably add a new random type of risk, this could exemplify climate change for example, a type of risk that can affect develop countries, and where there is little research. This would make the game more challenging when you have enough money to protect just from meteorites, at the end, i didn't even use my insurance and I was ignoring it for a little bit because I knew  I was already protected for the meteorites, but if i know that something 'random' can happen (bad management, riots, flood, hurricanes...), i'll keep an extra eye on my insurance money</div>
