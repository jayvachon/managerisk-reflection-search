    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that he discussed his shortcomings and how he learned from them throughout the game. I think that his suggestion of his change to the game would not make much difference as the comets also may or may not hit, and the damage from the comets varies. So his suggestion would not bring more value to the game in my opinion. </div>
