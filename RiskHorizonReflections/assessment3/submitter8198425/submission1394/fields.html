    <h1>Submission 1394 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8198425, session_user_id: 61e6ccea7bf971ea98ee1de946a6a4efa6eca3e0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role was to build a community of strong and robust pods that will survive hits from comets as they come. buying insurance, having sufficient protection and constantly doing research helped me to be better prepared for the hits.  It had time to build up the community without fears of costs and time lines as i was better prepared.  preparing for risk before does not eliminate being hit but helps with recovery after being hit.  Preparing for risk immediately slows done development but recovery is much faster if you were better prepared and had insurance and protection.  Its just a matter of gathering the available resources and move on.<br /><br />I played the game multiple times before getting the hang of it.  The more I played the more I realized that I needed to make trade offs. I needed to invest on getting sufficient insurance. I needed to constantly do research to learn more about the comets and stop developing the community.  Building a "good foundation" in level one was critical for me to advance to upper levels as I had all the resources needed. I learnt that good initial preparation goes a long way.  It allows you to focus on other things that will assist with the situation.  I finally realized that research and preparation goes hand in hand.  Balancing between preparation for future risks and developing a community is very important but hard to do.  This is something that policy makers go through day in and day out.  They have to weigh the options to make an informed decision, but this will be possible if they do research to be better informed on the risk they are facing.<br /><br />It was very hard to click on protection and do some research at the same time.  If i had to add one thing to the game, I would give allowance to players so that they can do two things at the same time.  In reality, organizations have teams or people who are tasked to do different things at the same time. Hence it makes it possible to maximize the time and get things done.<br /><br /></div>
