    <h1>Submission 2293 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3154586, session_user_id: b539c5a4f273b73fa2c8b4c19432754846ef19c7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management is definitely vital to minimize the impacts of potential disasters, but more important is to know that possibility of a specific disaster. In the game I have to chose between invest in secure or improve infrastructure. My decision was based on the probability that each disaster will happen.

I think that the preparation for risk affect development in short term because if a natural disaster will happen tomorrow that will affect in a short term to the population and to growth of an specific country's economy. If we adopt now many preventives policies, our possibilities to growth will be more higher and in a medium term we can invest more in the population.

I played two times and I apply different strategy based on the probability of a disaster will happen. Itâ€™s very important to know first of all, the probability of each disaster, to know that its necessary to collect historical facts and according to this, We can choice a different policy because is not the same apply and specific strategies when a country had  flooding disaster and the same country with an disaster cause by an earthquake.

To improve the game I suggest to specify the number of habitants per pots built and whenever pods are improved the number of habitants also grows. If a disaster occur, some people die according to insurance and infrastructure that had. I consider important express the impact of each disaster  in an economy way, but even more important to show the social cost.</div>
