    <div class="field-value">The student is very aware of the technical aspects of the game, as such there is a high degree of understanding of the game. However there is an ad-hoc approach to strategy, thus this is reflected in the students level of success in the the game. 
The student talked about the local risk issues faced within his/her local community, yet there is no established link between this and what has been learnt in the playing of the Risk Horizon game. Sadly, a demonstrated link between the local issues and risk management would have made for a better reflection.</div>
