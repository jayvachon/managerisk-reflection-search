    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of risk management in the game was to develop Alora community by development of undeveloped pods as many as possible through different stages protection and optimizing insurance levels from comets hitting Alora community. To understand the game takes some time. Initially I could not win even Level 1 as I tried to acquire maximum undeveloped pods without paying attention to protection. But then I purchased just three pods and then went for development in stages while protecting them through raising levels and  at least 50% insurance levels. When I had some surplus source for purchasing new undeveloped pods, i went for that. This way helped me to win Level 2 of the game. But in Level 3, it was difficult to achieve development of pods as comets were hitting frequently and the level of damage was high. So whatever growth achieved through development was not enough to raise the protection and get properly insured.<br /><br />2. After playing the game once, the second time my strategy was to purchase just few Three) undeveloped pods, protect them by raising levels and also insuring them at least 75%. This strategy worked well. But while playing Level 3 twice, I observed that even when I purchase just three pods for development, I was not able to protect them by raising stages of levels or insuring sufficiently as I did not have sufficient resources for level raising or insurance. This was due to rise in the frequency of comets hitting Alora and the degree of damage and cost of repairing pods. So managing resources available for development of pods while paying attention to protection by the level raising and keeping the cost of repairing the damaged pods by insuring sufficiently was the key factor in achieving development of Alora.<br /><br />3. While developing a new version of the risk management game, I would like to include some of present major risks faced by  all of us. Instead of comet hitting, I would like to include scenarios of earthquakes or floods. Also, if possible, the major problem of the climate change (rise in the global average temperature) due to rise in CO2 emissions could be realistically highlighted through such game. <br /><br />In my place, which is Pune, Maharashtra in India, the management of water resources has become very important. In Maharashtra, some regions are frequently affected due to scanty rains some years and very heavy rains other years. The monsoon pattern has also changed. Every year the state government has to provide relief aid to farmers, which does not reach to affected farmers. Even after spending more than US $12 Billion on improvement in irrigation facilities in last decade, improvement is less than 1% as per the data published by the state government. So the risk management should include bringing more awareness in the people about changing the climate, which is affecting the monsoon and how they can manage risks through changing crop pattern, adopting better methods of farming using less water and taking crop insurance. This is possible if the state and central government takes lead and educate the people in managing risks and achieving development of the self and communities.</div>
