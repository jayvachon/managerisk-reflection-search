    <h1>Submission 2180 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2835922, session_user_id: 925c8c817eb2457d6fe7b6858578f449595efa59)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management determines the success of medium
and long term development goal.  However,
the effective risk management coping strategy relies very much on the
combination of the knowledge on risk, protection from risk and transferring risk
(insurance). In game, there is challenge for decision maker to invest in research
and protection because s/he doesn’t know how much the impact would be reduced.  Another trade-off between the research and
protection is related to the cost and time availability. Although research
doesn’t cost anything (in game), it requires a lot of time, which is the
precious resource. Increase the protection costs so much, but at the same time,
it stalls the development. Thus, this trade-off is for decision maker to
balance on the investment on research and protection. Unlike understanding on
risk and community protection, insurance scheme could cover certain percentage
of damage. The preparation of risk management could protect community from
devastation, but affects the resource allocation to the development: The more
investment in risk management, the less resources (time and capital) available
for community development, which jeopardizes the development goal. </p>

<p>I played game multiple times. At the beginning, I chose development
growth path with premium insurance scheme, without realizing the importance of
research. This strategy allowed me to win level two or three only. When the severe
impact or due catastrophes hit in the level four, the community failed backward
very far and the development goal became unreachable. Later on I saw the
importance of research on reducing the damage, but I couldn’t reach the level
four. Finally, I changed the strategy by focusing on research on risk and pushing
development in correlation with level of protection with using fund from not
buying insurance in level one and two. However, I started level three with
buying premium insurance then focusing on protection and research. The
development growth was invested moderately, while the protection level was kept
high above average. Though it was costly policy, the damage was relatively
small, that I could win the level three. In level four, I kept using this
strategy with slightly increasing the level of protection, and I won level four.
In level five, the severity of damage became higher, so did the demand for development
growth rate. This was so challenging because increasing the protection and
research consumes the fund and time for development. In addition, the cost of
development and insurance was higher than previous stages of development. With
high severity comet strike, the development goal became so far. Although there
was fund for re-habitation, the development rate was too slow. Ultimately, I ended
game in level five.  </p>

<p>To improve the game, there are some changes. By using more
realistic things instead of pods construction and comet strike, e.g. buildings
construction in a community confronting risk of typhoons. The game lacks one
important aspect of risk management, which is soft measure and hard measure of
protection. </p></div>
