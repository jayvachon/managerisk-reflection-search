    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the logical development of the ideas which shows that the writer has a very good understanding of the topic. However, I would say the writer seems to have used the word 'research' loosely; s/he could have added a little bit more explanation when he mentions that : "Research is the best what you can do at the beginning". All in all, it's an interesting piece of writing.</div>
