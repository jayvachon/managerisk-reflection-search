    <h1>Submission 721 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6080349, session_user_id: 51662a435b030c0729865fe1a78c29458d21648e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Hello!<br /><br />I think that everybody wants to develop. You start the game with financial resourced to build the community. And you do. But, as you are aware of the risk of flooding, you start community protection. Everything goes smooth until you see the comet. Now it's time for research and taking actions up-front. As the game time is limited and the comet is coming, you have a moment to decide what is best to be done. Either you buy insurance of smaller coverage or a bigger one in the case of high severity comet, or you can invest in development of the community in the case of low probability to be hit by the comet and flooding as well. Preparation for risk helps to develop. And the results are seen after some time.<br />Wrong choice brings flooding with damage. If no insurance was purchased, then the development is stopped to recover community. Research is the best what you can do at the beginning. Then, basing on the knowledge of the past comets influence, you take the actions on risk management.<br />I have played the game 2-3 times till I have won the first level. I was trying to develop community, to upgrade it as quick as possible, along with research of the sky. I have bought insurance. And that was not enough to succeed. I have better analyzed the research information to take correct actions. Now, even being hit by the comet, no damage was done to community, and I could upgrade or build a new pod.<br />Knowledge of the possible risk is not enough. We should understand the risk and what impact it will have. Thus, we should research the risk to know how to protect ourselves.<br /><br />I live in Moldova, an agricultural country in the South-Eastern Europe. Thus, weather conditions are very important for a good harvest. During last years it looks like we do no have much luck. A cold winter without snow, ground frosts in spring, heavy rains day-by-day, droughty summer, and yield becomes fewer. Farmers are installing weather station equipment, anti-hail nets, in order to protect their crops.<br />We have a big river that brings floods. Some communities have suffered after the flood year after year. The habitants are not willing to relocate to a safer place because of the lack in the financial resources. The state also lacks resources to help all of them. Although the warning about the flood possibility is announced, people are not taking necessary actions. As it was mentioned in this course that people prefer to think that "this will happen to someone else, not to me". So we need to change people's way of thinking. It is much easier to blame the state for not helping after the flood, instead of taking actions after the warning.<br />As for the game, I would propose to add another risk like an earthquake. Because in real life we confront multiple risks.<br /><br />Thank you!</div>
