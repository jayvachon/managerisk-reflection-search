    <div class="field-value">The reflection is clearly articulated and gives a clear account of the obstacles encountered in playing the game.  However, the question on the trade off was a little mixed up, and the author did not address how preparations on risk affected development. I feel that some of  the experiences in playing the game should have been translated into learning experiences. It should be noted however, that the quality of the video and the presentation was remarkable. </div>
