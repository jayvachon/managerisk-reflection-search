    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is her proposal to show the severity of the meteors in the corner of the game board where the information of each meteor is available to view without having to click on each meteor one at a time.  This is because my proposal included the same idea and I completely agree.
One thing that would make this reflection better is to share something about her own way of life in her current living situation, describing how the game relates or differs from the role of risk management she makes for herself in real life.</div>
