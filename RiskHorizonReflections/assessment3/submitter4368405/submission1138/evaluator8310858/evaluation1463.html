    <div class="field-value">i am happy to evaluate your concepts.you are right.i also can't across level 2.it's too hard.
What is the key strength of this reflection?
>>the author wrote this reflection diligently.this reflection described a development project step by step.and we could image this plan how it works clearly.
What is one thing that you think would make this reflection better?
>>in my opinion,maybe you should consider the outside environment,such as policies and financial condition.these things may inflect your decision.
maybe i am not right,you could correct it.</div>
