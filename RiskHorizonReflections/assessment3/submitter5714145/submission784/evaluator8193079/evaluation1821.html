    <div class="field-value">Strength:-
The reflection was very well written and crisply presented, which made it a pleasure to read. Also, the level of situation based analysis and reflection with regards to every component of game play made the content very relevant.

Area which could make the reflection better:-
1. I believe more could have been written on the lessons learnt though the game. At times the reflection seemed more to be an account of actions taken without talking of the deeper thoughts and lessons that went into the decisions made
2. The reflection did not answer the last part of question 3 which talked about risk management choices with regards to the place you live in.

Great job overall!!</div>
