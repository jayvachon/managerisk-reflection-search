    <div class="field-value">REFLECTIONS FROM THE RISK HORIZON GAME. 
The whole essence of the game scenario is; managing risks from comets and flooding and how to manage it in a community that is susceptible to such calamities. The game calls for thinking strategically i.e balancing between preparing for these inevitable risks and investing in community development on the one hand and also thinking about the different tools one can deploy to confront these risks on the other hand. 
I often more than not started each level with Insurance, as one progressed, the insurance policies I chose depended largely on how much was available with the need to have small funds on hand for the inevitable repairs coming a distant second in my consideration. More funds tended to be made available if one leads off with purchasing an insurance policy option which I then channeled to properties. Property development was then done and continuously improved as opportunities presented themselves. Research was a sine-qua-non at every opportunity while protecting (raising the island) often came after the green meter is filled. In preparing for inevitable risks, I often slowed new developments but consolidated on existing community awareness relationships often by raising and holding the button on the lower right briefly and leaving it before the green on the upper left completely turns red. Toggling this button intermittently seemed to help occasionally.

The game could be addictive though, but one learned to thread the fine line between risk preparation and developing ones community which is quite a thrilling challenge once you get in the game. Spend too much on building and upgrading pods and you will be exposed to comets when they hit. Any damage sustained from comets hinders progress and often means rebuilding at great costs. On the other hand, spending too much on preparing for risks leaves one with not enough money to develop the community sufficiently to make it to another level. 
One simple thing I would want added is building of flood barrier or levees, at a cost of course, as well as underground bunker housing. The former greatly reduces flood devastation while the latter reduces casualties in the case of direct comet strikes (given advance warning through research, people can be directed to such shelters in time before the comets or floods hit). This option should be made available even from the start of the game so that we can build from the ground up.</div>
