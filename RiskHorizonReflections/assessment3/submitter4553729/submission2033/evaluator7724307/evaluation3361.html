    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection was the writer's ability to take their own experience in life and include it into the reflection. I was able to see their approach and strategy while playing the game. However, there definitely can be some improvements in the writing. There are bright ideas and thoughts in the reflection, unfortunately they do not transition well together nor do are they very cohesive. I would advise the writer to proofread their work and check on their grammar use. </div>
