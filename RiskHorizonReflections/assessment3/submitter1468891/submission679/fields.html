    <h1>Submission 679 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1468891, session_user_id: a7e690b93667da00142edbb3bd316c7b38405b03)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role risk management was to manage the development of a community and to prepare this community to confront risks. <br />In the game we learnt in a practical way how important is:<br />-manage resources: mainly in terms of economic resources and time investment. Playing we understand that the investment is one of the keys to confront risk. A community with good infrastructures, good education, good public and private actors will manage much better their risks. This is the reason why all along the lectures, it is emphasise the fact that developing countries have more difficulty to manage their risks. For example, in the game if we do not build enough pods, the risk of the comet to hit is higher, or if we do not have the financial resources we can't repair the damages. <br />-manage information: knowing the probabilities of the risk is also a key in order to confront them. In the game thanks to the screen we could know the probabilities of the comet to hit the community and we could not be prepared. For example in countries where the natural disasters are common, it is important for them to have good tools in order to make previsions and so be prepared in case of a disaster. It is important to have a good quality information so it can help us to manage our risks. <br />-invest on infrastructures: a community with good infrastructures will be better prepared to confront risk than the one without. The main problem is to find the financing of different actors, and one a community got the financial resources it is important to know how to use this money.<br />-invest on insurances: be preventive is key in risk management. Invest in good insurances can save lives and prevent crisis. <br />-the support of other actors of the community: another important point of what the game show us is how important the actors of a community need to be connected in order to in this case confront risk but also in order to reduce exposures. A community who shares risks between its actors can overcome better the obstacles. <br />The experience is another fact we need to take in acount, because even if we play the game several times, we can make the same mistakes, and this same exemple apply to the communities, it is not because a country had confront several risks along the time that they would be prepared and that they the would know how to deal and manage the risks<br />The game show us also the importance to compare the different risk management measures and how to priorize the most cost-effective ones.     <br />In conclusion this game show us that the three actions we need to take in advance are: gaining knowledge, acquiring protecion and obtaining insurance and that if we do not take risk we would not be able to buil a community and we would not be prepared to confront risk and as we have seen along the course, " Taking risks is necesry to pursue opportunity". All the factors that help us to manage the risks should be taken in a package, it means that we can have the proper information but not the insurance, or we can have the financial resources but maybe comunitis dont use them in the correct way, on the other hand we should not think that one fact is more important than the other, because it depending on the situation we are we have to priorize one fact or the other, for exemple the knowledge instead of the insurance. We need to decrease the losses but also increase the benefits of the community. <br /><br /></div>
