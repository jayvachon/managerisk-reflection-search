    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><b>What was the role of risk management in the game? </b><br /></span>There are a number of elements in the game, development (building or upgrading pot), protection, research and insurance.<br /><br />The target of the game is to strike a balance among these factors within limited time and resources.<br />We only have two input....money and time, to be invested in different parameters, namely, developing new pot, upgrading, protection, insurance, and research.<br /><br />Also, we have to make reserve on money required to repair in case the protection is not enough.<br />It's not an easy job to strike a well balance among these factors.<br /><br /><b>What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? <br /></b>I chose to build new pot at the beginning, and when I was waiting for the completion of pot, I spend all the money on protection.<br />Once I have $200, I build new pot. And when I have less than $200, I spend the time on protection<br /><b><br />In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?</b><br />From Level 1 to 5, Protection is the most effective mean to prepare for risk.<br />I didnt spend any on insurance and just randomly click on comet to check if protection enough.<br /><span><br /><b>If you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?</b><br /></span>I played the game more than once, I found that the game perform much better in Firefox than Chrome.  I didnt notice Protection is that powerful and I always suffer from serious loss without sufficient protection in the first time<br />The main things you learned from the game is to strike a balance among these factors within limited time and resources.<br /><br /><div><strong>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</strong></div><div>I would add an option to exchange for more time by using money.<br />As time is kind of important factor should be take into account.</div></div>
