    <h1>Submission 369 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7648518, session_user_id: dd858065a9adb7544d261493bac9ba455c35f508)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>Recently I had to play a game called
Risk Horizon . It was a fun game that prompted the player to realize how
important risk management is. This game is based on the preparation and what to
do before and  after the comet hits the
player’s  pods (dwellings)  that he/she builds.  This game was designed to prepare the player for
the unexpected, because it is not if it comes, it is the inevitable when it
comes, how hard it hits, how severe the damages are after the hit. Also what to
do after the fact </span></p>



<p><span>The good part is that there is a way
to prepare through research and a way to protect through insurance ahead of
time. Also; the ability to absorb” the comet 
hit”, overcome the damages to the pods, then continue to build. Be able
to bounce back quickly and continue.</span> 


</p><p><span>In this game like every game there
are choices, trade-offs you have to make while playing, thus  there are consequences as well. In fact there is
a physical aspect that had trade offs if building when a comets hits, it limit the
player to either build additional new pod or repair the existing . The
intellectual aspect ( decisions, knowledge/ research &amp; protection/insurance)
that also required tradeoffs before the comet hit the player had to decide when
to research prepare for future hits , and how to protect the pod community as
the comet was about to hit. </span></p>



<p><span>If I only  played the game only once,  or  had
to play several times again, what I would do differently would be  to refer back to the instructions , perhaps
the tutorial . This along with the previous my experience ( “If any”) should help
me be more be resourceful with the games’ tools. As you see it s focal point is
knowledge through research, thus allows to see and prepare better. When you
know more your are able to see clearer , plus experience allows to  perform confidently . If you know how to
protect yourself from the comet hits and  the player knows what to do after the hit more
efficiently thus he/she plays better. </span></p>



<p><span>I learned many things from the game.
I realized how important it is to research, to understand, to gain knowledge  in order to prepare, because we never know how
hard  “the hit” it will be and when “the
hit” is coming. With the right knowledge and ability to think it through, you
can plan and prepare better<u> </u>for that hit”. In most likelihood it will minimize
the damage, allow me  to cope with it
easier and continue to move forward in a positive direct. To mitigate loss if
any.</span> 

</p><p>This game captures several aspects
of risk management. If I had the task of developing a new version of this game,
I would implement a way or tool which allows the player to have the ability to
multi task and to access others to helping hands…. “Strength in numbers.” 

</p><p><span>This change I propose would better
represent risk management choices in Miami Florida where I live. A close nit community
is key , along with  quick access to
additional tools that would allow the player to multi- task, do more at once..  For example; this” additional  hands tool” would  be able to, research and get insurance/ protection
( Shield) while building or repairing at the same time. This tool would also
allow to( similar to Adobe Photoshop  hand)  be able to move the scope of the screen around
better , and be able to see more thus able to prepare better at a shoter notice.
