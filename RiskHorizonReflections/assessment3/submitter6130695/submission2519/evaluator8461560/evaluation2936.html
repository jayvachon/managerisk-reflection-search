    <div class="field-value">Full participation and understanding of the game. The reflection was very well articulated with full knowledge of the game and its ourpose that it is difficult to think of anything else that would make this reflection better, however the final question was not answered adequately in stating what would be added or changed to better represent the risk management situation where you live. The author simply stated remedies for risk management in their locality rather than attribute the risk management choices within their locality to the gaming structure of the task. </div>
