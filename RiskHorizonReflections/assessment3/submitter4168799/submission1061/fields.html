    <h1>Submission 1061 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4168799, session_user_id: 5e547759499f8d49e3cebe83a55dbf6d4635709a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>This game reflects the struggle of most people or businesses
who have to handle complex and uncertain scenarios, often only equipped with scare resources.
Even with some sort of information (e.g. probability of impact), we find ourselves
having to second guess to make partially informed decisions. The comet information provided knowledge of the threat, while the land raising helps to create protection from the threats and the insurance feature helps with coping after the comets strike - all while trying to achieve the specific goal of growth.</p><p>With limited time
before impact, I had to make split second decisions on one prevention measure
versus another. i.e. Should we continue with research or raise the land to
minimize impact? If the risk levels and extent of possible damage were low, I took risks to continue building instead of increasing protection. When I found the risks great or possible damages high, I put my efforts into improving the protection levels. </p><p>During the game, I found myself having to delay repair
decisions as well, in case another impact occurs shortly. There were times when
there were double impacts in a short space of time, showing that shocks can
often hit us multiple times, even before we recover from the previous one. However,
delaying the repairs also slowed down the income rate, which could lead to
further cashflow issues further down the game. </p><p>I felt it was better to always
retain some buffer money in case of emergency needs. To create this buffer, I
had to delay upgrades and this affected my growth rate. A good balance of spend
versus save had to be struck in order to fulfil the requirements to continue to
the next stage. </p><p>Insurance was a good feature as comets struck in every level. It
was better to spend on insurance than the bear the full effects of the losses.
This in turn, facilitates the recovery rate as you only need to spend a
fraction on the repair costs and get you back on track quicker. In real-life,
insurance can help businesses cope with the negative effects of the crisis and
create more resilience towards potential threats such as financial downturns. </p><p>Repeating
the game, I found myself employing different strategies. I stopped quickly
building, and instead, concentrated on surveying the comets and their possible impacts.
I delayed repairs (or did partial repairs) in case another nearby comets struck
twice. I spent more time on research and increase the ground height then purely
going for upgrades. Instead of buying the cheaper insurance options, I found
myself buying the best protection I could afford. </p><p>Although there are only three
variables in this game, it shows the volatile environment that all of us live
in. To make the game more interesting and challenging, we could add in the
option of increasing more variables in the higher stages. For example, building
wear-and-tear could be added to decrease the efficiency of the revenue
generation. This will require maintenance of the buildings to be added as a
measure of risk management. </p></div>
