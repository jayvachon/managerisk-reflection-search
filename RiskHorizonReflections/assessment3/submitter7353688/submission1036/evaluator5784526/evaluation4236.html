    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is knowledge.
The one thing that would make this reflection better is the protection.  In fact, the capacity to prepare for risk is not sufficient to make risk management an effective tool for development.   Furthermore, the reflection would have been a true representation of the horizon game and the risk management process if it would have combined the capacity to prepare and caring in advance and the ability to cope afterward.
