    <h1>Submission 63 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8200096, session_user_id: 56d4e02e39bd403cf0d9d81c503b6bbfa9c707b1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><br /><p>1. I think the role of risk management in the game was the use of the
terms Knowledge about the situation of the imminent danger (something that you
developed to playing again and again) the protection (that was the mean idea of
the game) and the insurance that you should have had with the constructions,
the preparation was essential in this case because we needed insurance in both
short and long term.<span><br /><br />
2.
Really I played twice the game, of course it was different because in the
second time I had more experience about the consequences and the things that I didnâ€™t
do at the first time, the most important for me was the use of the mean
concepts and the planning for the upcoming future.<br /><br /><span>3.
Perhaps might add more danger situations ( earthquakes, hurricanes, fires etc.)
where the player is forced to make choices, new and creative decisions that
affect the life in the city.</span></span></p></div>
