    <h1>Submission 1200 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3632797, session_user_id: 31939f88d28ef60e2aad5a439d7f2b40ef12be60)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In my opinion, this game includes lots of important ideas about risk management. Let me illustrate in detail. In the game, we can use money to buy land and build some factories or something like that. Only when our factories have produced enough goods in certain time can we pass the game.<br />At the same time, we are facing the risk of being shocked by comets. When comets impact the land, all of our factories will get destroyed and need to be repaired. Every comet has its special destroy level and possibility to shock the earth we can speculate it by research but it is not accurate. We can use money to improve the security level or buy some insurance to protect our buildings. The money is limited at a certain time. So we are faced several trade-offs. Should we use money to produce more goods or should we use money to protect our existing buildings? If we choose to produce more goods, should we buy new land or rebuild old factory? If we choose to do some protection, should we buy insurance or improve the security level? How to distribute money among these choices? How to make choices at different time and under different circumstances? <br /><br />Playing the game only once is very different from playing for several times. The first time I played this game was really a failure. Part of the reason is that I do not understand the rules very well then. For instance, I didn't know what the security level is  at that time. During the process of trying again and again, I gradually understood what the trade-off is and how to execute different strategies under different situations. I began to check  the characteristics o every single comet carefully and take different actions. The main thing I have learned from this game is that the reality is complicate and changing every moment. We should observe the environment very carefully and then make our risk management strategies.<br /><br />If I could add one simple thing into the new version of this game, I would like to make the insurance policy more complex and more flexible. By providing people more kinds of insurance policies, players will have more choices. New game could provide insurance policy about comet shock, construction risk and liquidity shortage. Three kinds of comet shock like before is good, and if the building are destroyed for several times in a row, and never built up completely (sad story), The insurance can also give some help. The last kind is about money, when the money player have are under a certain amount, like $100, insurance can provide some urgency help. Of course, all these insurance policy cost some money to buy.</div>
