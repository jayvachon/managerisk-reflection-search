    <div class="field-value">This student has a clear understanding of the how the game relates to the course and it's application to real world situations. I like his/her idea for valuing the pods differently. This makes sense and would occur in real life.

I would be interested to know what specific problem the student is referring to in real life (where s/he lives), which would have articulated the second sentence in question 3 a bit more clearly.</div>
