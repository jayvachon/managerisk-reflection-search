    <div class="field-value">I enjoyed reading your reflection. I believe you did a great job reflecting the trade-offs of risk and management. You realized that one needs to mitigate risks in order to build capital and better livelihoods. I would also point out that research is a big part of risk management; however, one needs to be mindful that research costs time and money, specially as one continues to use technology to do so (this is one of the greatest and most challenging trade offs of development), Obviously, this may have a good outcome in the long-term, but in depth research should always be in place with pro-active development strategies. </div>
