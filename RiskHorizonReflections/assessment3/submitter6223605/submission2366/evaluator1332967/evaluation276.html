    <div class="field-value">Congratulations for your assignement! You have really gathered and highlighted all the important points for this lesso. As well, readers can tell that you have thought carefully about the implications and paralelisms existent between the game and the risk management theory.

The only thing I can think of to make this reflection better is linking more the redaction instead of doing the questions subdivided by numbers, but, I think it is just a preference of style, it is not really important. As I have said, I find your essay very interesting and complete, so I cannot critizice the content!</div>
