    <h1>Submission 136 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4504104, session_user_id: 157a41d9fa587a4cd7443a320a294407c553ff55)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The <b>Risk Horizon </b>game included three risk management
components which were Research, Insurance and Protection.The risks facing the planet of<b>
Alora</b> was of a natural disaster i.e getting hit by a comet.</p><p></p><ul><li><strong>How Risk Management was helpful</strong>:<br /><em><strong>Research</strong></em> helped
the process by providing understanding about the features of a particular comet.This
included "chances of being hit" by a comet.As the Luminator the task was
to adopt a real time strategy of preparation and coping measures against the
risk.<br /><em><strong>Protection</strong></em> helped Alora by decreasing the probability of getting hit by a comet
and making sure that the size of losses was reduced in case of a disaster.<em><strong>Insurance</strong></em>
provided necessary savings which were kept aside to recover from the losses
of being getting hit by a comet.Thus Research,Protection and Insurance provided<b>
tools of preparation</b> and coping so that the planet becomes more resilient against
a risk and is able to pursue new opportunities.The resources had to be judiciously
distributed among development, protection and insurance.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>Strategy</strong>:As risk management
was important ,money had to be used for insurance and protection,decreasing the outgoing
money for development from time to time.Required changes were made depending
upon the situations being faced.For example:When money had been spent for insurance
and development was good,resources were spent on increasing the protection so as
to decrease the chances of getting hit by a comet.The immediate effects of these
steps surely decreased the rate of development but at the time of crisis<i><strong> due to proper
risk management measures </strong></i><i><strong>the losses incurred were less</strong></i><strong>.</strong>Thus level of destruction
was reduced.The resources could now be allocated for the development.<br /><br /></li><li><strong>GamePlay</strong>: I played the game more than once.The first time I played
the game I used greater amount of money building pods on the planet.This left
less money for insurance and protection.Hence the planet was frequently hit by comets
making large damages. When I played the game again I changed my strategy by distributing
money wisely on both risk management and development.So the <strong><em>lesson I learned</em></strong>
was that risk management is as essential as development. It might not show its
benefits initially but in the long run the benefits can be huge.<em>Thus allocating your money
for risk management is vital.</em><br /><br /></li><li>Assuming the role of Luminator as the role of Government in the modern world ,all the risk management measures were taken by him .No steps were taken by individual and communities.The game could add features which could display steps available for these levels of society.This would enable better realization of risk management in the real world.Also Insurance and Protection are broad terms.Protection could have sub-parts like teaching risk management in to individuals,enhancing space research capability etc.Nevertheless ,the Risk Horizon game was pretty interesting.<br /></li></ul></div>
