    <div class="field-value">I both like and dislike the fact that you've suggested an "abandon planet" clause in your review. On the plus side,it shows how you think laterally and out of the box while thinking of a solution to a problem but on the downside,it is exactly that. You are looking for a way out of a problem that you have been entrusted with. In real life you won't have such an easy exit policy,just keep that in mind! Apart from that, it was very well written and I also liked the concept of a loan for the game which would certainly improve gameplay and increase the suspense in the gameplay! Good review overall,pleasure reading it!</div>
