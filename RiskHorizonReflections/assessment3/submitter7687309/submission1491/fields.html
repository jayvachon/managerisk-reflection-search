    <h1>Submission 1491 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7687309, session_user_id: 4b1bf0916656d690d03e876769ae1fcb48ca1f49)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management is the act of managing risk so that to prevent or protect ourselves in case of unforeseen situation in the future. Insurance is also a crucial component of risk management because in case of future calamity the losses can be covered and substantially minimized by using this great tool of insurance in risk management.<br />
The game was in itself was a case study of risk management. The game used protection for the pods by lifting the pods. The insurance was available to mitigate the losses in case of a damage by meteors. The knowledge about the damage from meteors by using research for meteors was very helpful to gauge the severity and probability of the risk of meteor attack.<br />
By protecting the pods to the level of severity of the meteor helped in achieving protection or no damage to the pods even though it is hit by a meteor. By researching about the meteor and gaining knowledge about it helped in understanding more accurately the severity and probability of a meteor attack. By insuring the pods for 50% or 75% insurance helped in mitigating the losses in case the pods were damaged by the meteor. The insurance helped in faster recovery and used significantly lesser amount to cope up the damage scenario.<br />
Thus preparation for risk by using optimized levels of protection and insurance helped in better , faster and cheaper recovery to the normal state and enhanced the coping ability of the pods.<br /><br />
After playing the game for the first time, i learned only one component or approach to save the pods was not enough and was leading to the significant damage of the pods and recovery was not sufficient to proceed the level and win it. So, the next time on wards a balance and strategic optimization of the knowledge, protection and insurance components was crucial to reduce the probability of damage and recover faster and cost effectively in case of damage due to the attack.<br />
So a balance of knowledge, protection and insurance for cost effectiveness is vital for any risk management function or entity to act effectively.<br /><br />
The protection and insurance components in the game are very realistic and follows the real life situations. But the knowledge part which comprises of the research of the meteors in not enough since it does not the conveys the risk properly so it is difficult to assess the risk and act. If the knowledge part is more elaborate and clarifies the risk properly it would be highly beneficial to mitigate the risk and act towards it more effectively. <br />
Hope these changes in the next release of the game better explains the concept of risk management more effectively.</div>
