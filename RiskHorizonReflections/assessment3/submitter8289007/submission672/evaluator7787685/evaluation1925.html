    <div class="field-value">A) The key strength of this reflection was the students emphasis on research and to evaluate the situation as more research was done to know the exact likelihood of hit and the severity. this would allow an assessment of how much money should be spent on protection and balance development and protection. Ad the more you developed the more money you got for development. B) The one think that would make this reflection better is what the student would have liked to change in the game that would make it more meaningful for risk management in the place where they live.   </div>
