    <h1>Submission 316 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3843674, session_user_id: 7eb5945af114aaf55e973b2ba28e24ea421c83e3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">To begin with, to be prepared for any circumstance you have to get an insurance. Pay for an insurance, whether it is property, life or accident insurance. Just like in the game, after i started building houses I insured them in case of any instances of the comet hitting the community. Everything we do has some cost, whether time or resources. Depending on the building i build will determine the kind of insurance I should pay for.<br />More importantly, I learnt that research and acquiring knowledge help a lot in risk management. This helps to know what lie ahead and know what effects will come after any natural disasters should occur. I learnt if you should do enough research and acquire enough information about future disasters to occur, You will get to know some things such as the chance it may occur and the severity of the disaster.  This means that usually people who live in disaster - areas, If they have the knowledge of disasters that can occur in their places they live in, They will know how to protect themselves. From the game, after doing enough research on the comet, I got to know the severity of each comet and the chance of hit and from such information, I got to know how to protect my land by raising the land to a level that the impact of the comet will not affect the community. <br />In life being knowledgeable about risks and disasters helps one to protect himself for future events. Research is a high benefit in risk management because through research one get to know more about something and gets some knowledge of it to be able to use that information to help him in the near future. <br />In terms of protection, one doesn't just protect himself because he needs to. An individual will protect himself when he knows he will be in danger soon. In the game I was able to protect w myself when I knew before hand the chances the comet will hit on the community. Also this case  insurance comes in because if maybe the protection you had did not protect you enough for the circumstance, the insurance will be an assured cover for you.  <br />With Investments too, One has to invest with respect to his starting capital and resources available. In the game at level one, I had a lot of money to spend. So i started with building like 4 buildings then insuring it. As time progressed , I was able to get more money. I used some to build more houses and expand the ones that have been already built. In life investments need time to mature. Also , one need to plan well to spend his money well. Not to invest everything at the start, but to invest some, get some to save and use some to pay for insurance.<br /><br />To conclude, Knowledge, Research, Insurance and Protection are the building block in Risk Management. With these tools , people can effectively manage risks and protect themselves from untimely circumstances that may happen in the near future.</div>
