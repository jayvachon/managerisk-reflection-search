    <h1>Submission 2561 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5983425, session_user_id: c8b85910a07d11fd7753d60dda3bbe84008776c5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk management had important role in the game. When probability of hit was high, it was good to had high insuranse and protection and research as high as possible. When probability of hit was low, it was better to invest in development than in insuranse and protection.
I was played in the game several times and in the begining it was quite difficult to me to pass it. After the first time I focused more on research.  
In the higher levels it was too little time to anything for me.</div>
