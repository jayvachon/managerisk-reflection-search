    <h1>Submission 528 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8027601, session_user_id: 9983a6f03c1d29bff4fc4a832a14891a7b3df8a9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The aerolite and its crush on the planet is the risk of this game. To protect the planet and buildings on it, I have to do some risk management to minimize the possible damages. To achieve the goal of each level, I have to balance on development and risk management by gaining knowledge, doing protection, and purchasing insurances. However the resources (time and money) are limited, so I put most resources on gaining knowledge, once I found aerolites coming, I will do the research immediately, and examine the risk of impact by the chance of hit and the damage it would take. Protection needs time, so I do that when all the development are doing well and no aerolite is coming. And insurance is more and more expansive, so I choose not buying it at the beginning of the game, but after the examine the risk of crush, I might buy insurance for in case.<br /><br />2. I played several times, and the main thing I learn is do not forget my objective. I paid too much attention on risk and forget the main objective is development. So I majorly put the resource on the development, and keep my eye on the coming aerolite and do the risk management, rather than put risk management as the first priority. If the development goes not well, than I just put the cart before the horse, and it is wrong!<br /><br />3. The game is great, and I learned a lot from it. However, if I have a chance to do some changes, I will try to make people can restart from specific level rather than restart from the very beginning.Â </div>
