    <h1>Submission 882 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5696542, session_user_id: 7c7f1e857fe67c642f7eee66f96e06422b1ffabe)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">What is Risk? <br />Risk is an uncertainty that could have an adverse effect leading to loss, harm or damage.<br /><br />What is Opportunity?<br />Opportunity is an uncertainty that could have a positive effect leading to benefits or rewards.<br /><br />From above to definition we understand that the common ground for both Risk and Opportunity is UNCERTAINTY.<br />Risk and Opportunity go hand in hand. The Game was a good test of Preparedness, Action and Coping. <br />To overcome the risk it becomes important to understand the type of Threats that can be a cause of worry, and proactively prepare the infrastructure to deploy in a case of happening of the Threat,<br />In-spite of preparedness, there is always a possibility of minimal damage to assets. Such assets can be insured and due to which the cost of replacement reduces tremendously. <br />By Proactive behaviour the player can reach higher levels in the game and gets an opportunity to even secure higher percentage.<br />But Coping also is key to survival. Coping would help re-analyse the whole Risk management strategy.<br /><br />Thus, Knowledge allows you to understand the Threats,<br />Protection allows you to escape or minimise the effect of the Threat/Risk,<br />Insurance allows you to minimise the loss, and<br />Coping gives you the time and energy to bounce back to neutralise the effect of the Threat/Risk.<br /><br />Thus, i would like to highlight the importance of Decision and Change for Risk Management. <br />The Decision: <br />1. To identify what is the Risk? <br />2. What is the severity of the Risk? <br />3. What would be the impact of the Risk?  <br />4. What is the preparedness to face the Risk?<br />Change is to keep improvising on the activities of prevention on reducing the risk by gaining more knowledge on previous experiences and todays availability of resources. <br /><br />Thus, for me take away from the game would be as below;<br />1. Risk Management can be a powerful tool for development. It can save lives, avoid damages and bring up opportunities. Risk management can become the way of Sustainability.<br />2. Identifying Risk is by itself is not enough but also it is necessary to identify the obstacles to risk management and correct them.<br />3. Connectivity/ Network between Individuals, Households and the Community helps in avoiding and coping with risk in a larger manner.<br />4. Most importantly the Risk management requires Proactive behaviour and not reactive behaviour. You have to be prepared in a cyclical manner and not just react today and forget.<br /><br /><br /></div>
