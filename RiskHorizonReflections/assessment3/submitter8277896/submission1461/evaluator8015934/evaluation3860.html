    <div class="field-value">The strongest aspects of your work are found in the clear presentation of your detailed analysis of the game. It is obvious that you paid particular attention to the game's reflection of real life and you have successfully drawn detailed conclusions which have aided me in my own thinking. The one thing that would make this reflection better would be if you looked at the role of research in the game. It seemed that you focused heavily on insurance, development, and protection but skipped over the importance and challenges of research. Overall though, this was a very well constructed reflection, and your analysis and comprehension of how the game translates to real situations is remarkable. </div>
