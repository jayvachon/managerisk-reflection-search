    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>“Risk Horizon” is a game of trade-offs of time, cost and
scope. Risk management is the key to assist the development with protecting
against comets.</span></p>

<p><span>The
first time, I prefer to buy insurance and raising village for protect. As plain
as the nose on one’s face. I completely ignored knowledge that research comets’
meter, and it was related to protect by making community connections, because
the more we invested in research, the more time we have to do community connection
adds. Other thing is almost every action cost wealth. I built and upgraded pods
faster, so my wealth pool kept increasing the amount, but all expenses was
large. Upgrade fee, repair fee and insurance premium were increased by levels. Especially
for lighting up protection level, it almost spent wealth continuously. It’s
time over when I have just reached the level 5 line indicated, due to a
severity comet threaten. It caused a big damaged and made the development meter
went back-below the level 5. My preparation for risk affect development is
immediately, but it was not good enough. Yes, a shock is imminent.</span></p>

<p>After
that, I adjusted my way to play the game. I spent more and more time to invest
in research for getting more accurate predictions and having more time to make
community connections to protect. At the same time, the protection level bar
did not keep spend wealth. Saving wealth was also interlinked to other parts of
the game: having wealth to buy high level insurance for more cover of damage;
having wealth to upgrade pods immediately in case of time running out; or
having wealth to repair pods after damaged. As we had knowledge to reducing
uncertainly risk and had protection to reduce losses, we also brought high
cover insurance prepares us for high severity comets and replenished some of
our lost development. I found that I took shorter time to reach different
levels. The main things I have learnt from the game are risk prevention is very
important, however, knowledge is the key of risk prevention, and coping risk.</p>

<p><span>This
game is a simulation of natural disaster on earth. The person who made this
game has a great creative imagination. I think this game is quite perfect and
only thing might have to improve is the graphic or change to Alien attack
instead of comets attack. Build up a electric barrier instead of the rising
ground would be reality.</span></p></div>
