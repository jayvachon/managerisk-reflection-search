    <h1>Submission 1982 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2095816, session_user_id: 29cf8768ee1939fc1d98a0011b69ee5d0f9c6c0c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. The role of risk management in this game seemed to be preparing for the shocks that came from the comets hitting the planet, minimizing the damages that may occur, coping with what happened if they did impact the planet, and trying to avoid damaging effects. 
there were obviously other components to the risk management strategies like  building communities before strikes in order to strengthen the community and allow for optimum growth through networking afterwards. the research component was also a large factor in managing the risk. by knowing as much about the possibility of strikes or the likelihood of it hitting were great contributing factors to not only minimizing the detrimental impact but also knowing how to prepare for example the level of insurance that may be required.

As I played the game several times there were trade off that I made in each situation. I realized that doing research was essential but not spending to much time on comets that were unlikely to hit or if they were going to have little impact. Raising the level of the village was useful only sometimes and at a certain point it no longer paid off but actually cost more to raise it for protection. Getting to much insurance left you with little money to rebuild after multiple strikes so you had to trade off the level of insurance with the needs of building and rebuilding the community.

2. As I played several times I realized what each of the options gave to the player in regards to value for money spent. At first I thought insuring at a high rate which resulted in costing less to rebuild was essential but realized quickly this was not the case. Changing the levels of insurance as the levels of the game changed was much more productive to 'risk management'. Connecting the pods as quickly as it was affordable turned out to be a good strategy. Getting ample knowledge through research on the highest risk comets made me more successful gaining higher levels in the game. Knowledge is essential in managing risk.

3. There were several thing I felt I learned form this exercise. Beyond learning that there were several components to be watched at all times and it was like having juggling balls in the air and if one fell or you took your eye off it the others were soon to "crash".

Other things I learned were taking preventative measures is imperative to success in risk management. 
Knowledge is very important and by using  this strategy it can improve your ability to take action in protecting against whatever you are dealing with. Although you can't spend all your efforts and energy in "research" as it will take your concentration off the other important components.
Having the right type and correct level of  insurance can certainly help people either take more risk or recuperate from disaster. More insurance   or over insuring is not always helpful or beneficial.
Coping ability comes from a variety of sources and there have to be sustainable methods in place to help people, communities, societies and countries survive. Coping is strengthened by the bonds that people have with others

In closing I found this game to be frustrating and challenging but very effective and invigorating as a  learning tool. It certainly illustrated the concepts of the readings and lectures in the course work in a very interactive way. I spent considerable time getting to the level I did and then trying to better my 'score' and hopefully learning more about the need of all the components of risk management and what it takes to be successful.
