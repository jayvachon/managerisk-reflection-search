    <div class="field-value">Firstly I would like to say that the Game has been described in great detail. Player accurately presented how to reach sixth level and achieved this level is impressive. Player described what actions he/she took and how he/she analyzed probability of risk.
I gave 2 points for Clarity and Comprehension, and "only"1 for Reflection because most of the essay concerns the game itself. In my opinion this part is too long/gives too many information comparing to part of the essay where reflections are described. I my opinion "reflections" should relate more closely to reality not only to the game. Despite this, I am really impressed that the player reached sixth level and described how he/she did this and I really like the idea of adding more risk of perhaps diminishing development rate.</div>
