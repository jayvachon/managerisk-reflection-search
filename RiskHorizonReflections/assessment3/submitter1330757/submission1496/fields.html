    <h1>Submission 1496 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1330757, session_user_id: a921f5237379b0fb6dfdda5dad2e0256365dbb22)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of Risk management in this game is very very crucial, as learnt - managing Knowledge (research), Protection, Insurance and coping and balancing within them was very important. There were time where we cannot spent much in insurance so we can get the cover only for 50% and concentrate in research and Protection. Doing research and analysing the comet severiority and matching protection according to the comets. Preparation for risk by doing research,and matching protection level was very important. without protection the damage caused may be very high and cost more time and amount to cope back,but if the protection matches the severiority  there will be no damage cause and may increase the wealth drastically and will help us to prepare for the next uncertainty well.<br /><br />when I played the game for the first time we will not know when the comets will hit , how the wealth with grow and how to match the protection level and the importance of insurance. But when I played it for the second time I used insurance well, spent more time on research, and tried matching the protection level to the severiority of the comet. Then when I played it again and again the speed and way I tried managing between research, Protection,coping and insurance was systematic. some times we need to concentrate on research, sometimes in development constructing and upgrading the pods.<br /><br />The once change I felt is , the comets  rather than just passing through and then blast happen suddenly. Graphics can be made as if comets are falling actually so that we can just find when the comets may fall. And an option line obstacle for Risk management in case of India, like corruption, amount if people in subsistence with lack of access to knowledge because there are some of the most important factors which affects risk management.<br /><br /></div>
