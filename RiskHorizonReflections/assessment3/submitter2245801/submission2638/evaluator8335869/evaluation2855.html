    <div class="field-value">I think you got quite well the elements for desition making from the game. It´s great that you learned the importance of having a balance in protection, insurance and research (the one I think you value the most now). I also liked that you speek about having a balance and a reconstruction shortly after the shock. 

I´m sorry when this happens in your country corruption holds back recostruction because of burocracy and leaks in the reconstruction budget. The same happens in mine. Mexico
