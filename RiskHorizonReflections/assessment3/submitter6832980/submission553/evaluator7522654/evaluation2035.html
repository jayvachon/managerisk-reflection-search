    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection lies in the student's narration of first hand experiences.He has tried to explain exactly what went on in his mind during the game,the mistakes he made and so on. This write up did not show much adherence to the framework that was given.It seemed the student did not comprehend what all he was expected to reproduce in the essay apart from his first hand experience while playing the game.</div>
