    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">For me, the role of risk
management was to find the right balance between protection, research,
insurance and fund for development. One must keep an eye on all of the aspects
in order to secure the safety and prosperity for his society. The main tradeoff
that I faced was obviously the delay in the pods development due to resource
allocation for disaster preparedness. However I found that trough research you
can identify and allocate the optimal amount of money to either insurance or
protection. So in my second game I have paid more careful attention to research
and then based on the facts I made my decisions where to allocate funds- to
protection, insurance or both.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">As stated before, after my first
game I have tried to base my decisions on facts provided by research. This paid
off, since I was able to allocate resources for disaster protection more
efficiently and therefore I had more money for development of the community. In
the first game I also tended to neglect the comets with low severity or chance
to hit, in some cases the comets hit my village and they rarely did damage to
the community, but it is a wise idea to be prepared for this little disasters
with insurance or, saved cash for repairs, because despite that the disaster is
of a low severity, it causes damage and thus a delay in development. A fact,
which could be easily managed and mitigated. Again, it is of crucial importance
to find the right mix of all the variables, since if you invest in some aspect
inefficiently this will directly affect the performance of the other elements
in the game. The main things I learned are that a society can be self-dependent
on risk management and that decisions must be made on exact data in order to
optimize the spending mix. Good inter society connections allow the
participants to mitigate the consequences of the disaster with low or next to
zero cost.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;">The one thing that I would add to
the game would be a fund with saved money, which must be used only to cope with
the consequences of a disaster. The accumulated amount can be given for
development at the end of the next level. This will act as an insurance, but
the money can stay in the society and, if not used then they can contribute to
development. </p>
