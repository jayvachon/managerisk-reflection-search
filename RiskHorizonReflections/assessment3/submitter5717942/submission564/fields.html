    <div class="field-value"><p><b>Risk Horizon Game
reflection</b></p>

<p>Risk management helped in preventing or reducing damage to
the development. In order to progress with the development without incurring
any damages, tradeoffs had to be confronted for instance, delaying the
development whilst protecting the development. Investing in the protection of
the development is another choice that had to me made, in order to prevent or reduce the risk of exposure to the falling comets. </p>

<p>Preparation for the risk affected the development in such a
way that more investment had to be made in the protection of the development
which could have been used in increasing the development. If the development was affected by the fallen comet, the level of 
protection decreased, as such extra protection had to be incurred however, maximum protection reduced the damage caused by the comets such that one could repair
the damage and continue with the development. Maximum insurance had to be
purchased in order to protect the development, this reduced the amount invested
in the development but eventually it helped in overcoming the shocks that were incurred
due to the damaged caused by the comets. Research consumed a lot of time which
could have been used to finish the developments fast but eventually the knowledge
gained helped to know the amount of risk the development was exposed to which
helped in maximizing the protection or not in order to prevent damage from the
falling comets.</p>

<p>Playing the game more that once helped me avoid the mistakes
I made in the first trial, such as forgetting to protect the development as well
as to purchase insurance. In the game, I learnt that protection, insurance and
research are important in preventing damage to the development.</p>

<p>I would propose a change that could also capture rivers flowing
through the communities. This type of rivers results to frequent flooding in my
country. It could be helpful if protection of developments from risks that
could result from physical features that exist amongst communities was included
in the game.</p>
