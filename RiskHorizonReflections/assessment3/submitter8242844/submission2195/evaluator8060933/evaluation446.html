    <div class="field-value">The reflection shows a fair understanding of the course's goals such as learning to prepare(protect in the game) and is well expressed. The linking between real life and the game existed and was well made.
The reflection did show little information about your reactions about what happened and while comets did have information about them right from the start, the information actually changed as time passed and as you research, and some risks seemed much smaller than they really are (comets seemingly much more severe than they really are) and vice versa and so this reflection while it was easy to understand and the writer did put some effort, but researching the risks was not well explained. A small final note: do not write "I guess" when you are making a piece of writing such as this. It may make the writer feel like you do not feel convinced by what you say much or did not put enough effort into your writing which is not the case in this reflection.
I believe that if you avoid making similar mistakes such as the ones mentioned above you can easily make an excellent piece of writing.</div>
