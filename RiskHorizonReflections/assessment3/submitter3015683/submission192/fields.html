    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game is not only fun but it help realize and evaluate alternatives at different scenarios. That is, one have the choice of protection, research, insurance and developments. The game puts the player on the spot, where he has to continuously choose at what point of the decision space he locates himself. The decision space has the following dimensions: Development, Insurance, Protection and Research, none of which is preferred to the others. Yet, the game proves that decisions, if are made consciously and with certain logic, have a higher expected profit and are more sustainable, than if are randomly chosen. at certain times, it is good to take the risk of buying an insurance, even if left with little or no money, but long term, it will pay off. At certain times, we must act immediately and protect ourselves with no insurance. long term point of view ' research always proved to create benefit. The is, following the comet was almost always beneficial for me. Insurance, when likelihood of damage was high, proved to be beneficial as well, as the repair cost was very low. Development must be done with care due to the fact that it is costly and may be expensive to repair in cases of disaster and comet hits. However, it is recommended to have an insurance for disaster when there is a well developed community. Natural disasters may be fatal to the community if not insured.</div>
