    <h1>Submission 2262 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7746610, session_user_id: aa9466d6ad921cb077f2ee210f71094320e546d4)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The main role of the game for risk management is
about getting knowledge to prepare for uncertainties like natural disasters,
flooding, etc. Besides getting knowledge you had to build infrastructure and improve
them for better resilience.</p>

<p>Also you had to balance between protection and
insurance, to protect the community, to recover faster than previous shocks and
to improve all.</p>

<p>In terms of knowledge, protection, and
insurance I made choices like first build pods, then I made some savings to get
better protection, when problems occurred, like the first meteor hit, I had to
get knowledge about it, as I gained more, I had more money to improve
protection, and when I had to balance between protection and uncertainty I had
to buy some insurance, to cover the losses I couldn’t protect.</p>

<p>As I was shocked, I had no damages, so I could
improve buildings to make stronger the community and to build better resilience
to problems. But then as I advanced in levels, I learn that problems where bigger
and many more than before, so I had to gain knowledge again, to balance between
protection and insurance, but also to improve infrastructure to develop faster
and as equal as I could for the community.</p>

<p>Preparation for risks affects development in a
way that if you don’t prepare for risk, than the shock is bigger so you have to
spend more money, time, less or not resilience to problems, and most important
is that you lack in terms of time.</p>

<p>I played the game like seven times, I learn
that is very important to gain knowledge about risks you can have, this makes
you prepare better for them, and when you cannot protect from something very
unknown in terms of probability, you have to acquire some insurance, to help
you in losses in cases of shocks, or to obtain profits if you did a good
preparation and the risk turns into an opportunity.</p>

<p>In my case, I would add the type of problems that
I could have in the community so people could select one or more to play for gaining
knowledge, and I would add simple situations, like cleaning, making laws, and
spreading information to people so they can simulate and associate the game
issues to real life big problems like natural disasters or fluctuations so they
can have a better understanding of real life problems and conscience about
them.</p>

<p>I think that using a game to help people to
understand real life situations is a good idea, like monopoly and cashflow game
of Rich dad Poor dad but in terms on disasters, change of laws, poverty, loss
of jobs. People can associate images, or situations like this in real life but
they need real issues to understand better, of course this may be a good idea
for people with less preparation abour risks, because as mentioned in week 2
video lectures, sometimes we are overconfident and think that some problems won’t
occur to me. It’s important to make the difference between having too much and
having less, because abundance sometimes create waste, and lack of resources
can help you to be effective, of course the behavior is important in terms of
good attitude, determination, desire for improvement, and knowledge to be
better. </p>

<p>I think that for developing countries, it'll
be very difficult to improve or become and OCDE member if they keep doing
things in the same manner. They have to take examples of Chile, o South Korea
that after some shock like war or earthquakes they improve in every way to
build better resilience to problems suffered before.</p>
