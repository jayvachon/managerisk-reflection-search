    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is that some definitions were clearly explained and some good examples were provided at the end.
One thing that would make this reflection better is that the student should have explained what was his experience while having played the game and that how it was i.e. the overall experience and the fact that it was about the game reflection, not about the explanation of the course. the answers were not clearly sated according to any of the above questions and if done so would make this reflection a better one.    </div>
