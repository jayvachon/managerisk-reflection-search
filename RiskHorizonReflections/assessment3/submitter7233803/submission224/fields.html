    <h1>Submission 224 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7233803, session_user_id: ddd4ef8550313a2994e1f0d1c53dbce6242d4311)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">   The purpose of the game is growth in an uncertain environment, and risk mitigation through the use of security integers. Certain levels, notably early on levels, are skewed so that you do not even need to purchase insurance; as protection helps mitigate the uncertainty. As the game progresses, higher levels of insurance are needed, notably 50% and 75% become increasingly viable, as the cost to repair buildings that are higher levels (5+), just as how in the real world it costs more to build and repair complex structures. Knowing how may comets each round helped judge the amount, or even necessity of insurance needed.<br />   As the game was played more then once, it was quickly easy to see that each scenario despite being similar is different in its desires to insure safety to win. After the first match, instead of many small structures, a few larger and complex buildings were made, which increased survivability.<br />   In the future, I would make it so that it is less skewed towards essentially the near-mandatory purchase of insurance in the later levels. As my degree is in Medical Economics, I see the desire, but the games has a natural bias towards insurance because of the lack of variables; and as such their is no way to intervene, so disaster is always imminent in the current game. An allies matrix, artificial buffer, or even a larger map split into regions would mitigate many of the minor problems.<br /></div>
