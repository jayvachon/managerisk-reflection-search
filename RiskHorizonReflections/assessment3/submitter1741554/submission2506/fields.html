    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><strong>Reflections from the Risk Horizon Game:</strong><br /><br />Following questions should be addressed:<br /><br /><strong>1. What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?</strong><br /><br />Answer:<br />Risk management was essential in this game to secure the pods and ensure the survival of the game society. At the beginning I invested less in research and only tried to rise the ground as flood protection. Neglecting research turned out to be counter productive for the outcome of the game. Only the right balance of knowledge, protection and insurance ensured success. Time was for me a critical problem, I often did not have enough time for observing comets and for fixing the pods. <br />The risk preparation (protection, insurance etc.) ensured that after a disaster the pods were rebuild faster and to soften a disaster.<br /><br /><br /><strong>2. If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?</strong><br /><br />Answer:<br />I played the game several times, at the beginning I made the mistake not playing a balanced strategy. After the first five games I somehow improved my strategy towards an balanced approach and finally managed the first level.<br /><br /><br /><strong>3. The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</strong><br /><br />Answer:<br />I would extend the documentation with a sample strategy section. I would also a short youtube video in ways a sample game is recorded. I would also add a label on the left side bar.<br /></div>
