    <div class="field-value">Seems that he has little time to being able to play the game more than once, and with the good knowledge of the theory and easy writing that he shows, I am sure he would be able to give more.

I will advice a couple of things. The first will be to break a little bit more your sentences. The first part is just too long, and the ideas are showing more a description than a reflection. The second one is that he should play the game several times. More knowledge and experience will bring more reflection.
Well done anyway, was very interesting to read your approach.</div>
