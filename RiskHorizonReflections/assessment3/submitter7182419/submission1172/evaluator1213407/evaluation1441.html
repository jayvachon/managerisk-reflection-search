    <div class="field-value">Overall, I found this reflection paper to be very well articulated. It clearly shows that the author learned quite a bit while playing the game. I especially liked your suggestion to have more players collaborating with each other in a possible new future version of the game. After all, such scenario would be more in line with the need for international cooperation in oder to herald the principles of risk management. I also have no particular suggestion on any specific area of further improvement. </div>
