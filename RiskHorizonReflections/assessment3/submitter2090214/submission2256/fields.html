    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div><b>Reflection Game Horizon Risk </b></div><div>Alora city under construction with negative factors that threatened its development, the primary role of the game Risk Horizon is trained in the importance of taking into account and maintaining a proper balance of elements (research, purchase protection and insurance) of risk management for the successful construction of the city Alora, </div><div>I played several times the first attempts only try to build the city without wasting precautions protecting the planet (use slider), insurance procurement and research of comets. This oversight avoid development in the construction of the city because he was unprotected Alora of flooding and destruction by the impact of comets, to the ignorance of this type of kite that would impact adds. Therefore the construction of Alora is difficult when you take into account the factors that favor its development and this is directly related to the elements of risk management such as: (1) insurance to transfer resources across people and time, from good to bad states of nature (2) knowledge to understand shock, internal and external conditions, and potencial outcomes, thus reducing uncertainty (3) protection to reduce the probability and size of losses and increase those of benefits (4)  coping to recover from losses and make the most benefits, <br /><br /></div><div>After several attempts to start game note: research (for comets), insurance contracts, and protection (use slider to keep high the city). These precautions are adequate before the impact of the comet, because raising the city, flooding is better scale damage by comet impact are reduced recovers faster losses, greater benefits are obtained to develop city ​​also selogra a higher level in the game. <br /></div><div><br /></div><div>So to achieve a higher level and started playing with the constructs (four units), hired insurance (50%) and investigate comets, according to the available budget. The construction of four units that I would secure better performance was 50%, 25% helped the little, while 75% was a bit difficult to recruit (time and scarce resources). </div><div>I learned the importance of having a safe time before the negative impacts (comets and floods); Also use protection - slide-bar before impact (reduced damage) </div><div><br /></div><div>Among the difficulties of understanding of the game was: (1) understand categories (1, 2,3 and 4) to investigate comets (2) to determine the amount of insurance available to me after each impact, only indicates the percentage of destruction does not indicate insurance reimbursement. </div><div><br /></div><div>In developing the new version of Risk Horizon I suggest: a table of information about the amount of insurance available after each impact.</div></div>
