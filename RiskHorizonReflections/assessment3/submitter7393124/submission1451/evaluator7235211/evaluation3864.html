    <div class="field-value">Great, in-depth analysis was made of the trade-offs between research, protection and insurance - weighing them out in terms of the amount of time and resources spent on them. This is a very reflective and organized essay that captures all aspects of the game. 
Its a great essay, but if you're really looking at room for improvement - The player could have talked about more specifics of what he learnt in the trials where he failed the levels and how he / she  used the lessons learnt to get through the levels the next time around.
