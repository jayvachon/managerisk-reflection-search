    <h1>Submission 1862 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8309202, session_user_id: 70e79255df1a01f27454f97a3b96d6f89d37b83c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In this game risks had to be managed effectively in order to save the community that was being built. There was a short time span in which, as a risk manager, I had the responsibility of choosing whether to invest in knowledge, protection or insurance. The trade-off made the game very interesting. Preparation for risks was essential: insurance helped diminish the investment in reparation once the meteors hit the community; investing in knowledge (research) helped the risk manager know more about the meteors; and elevating the community from the sea level as a protection tool also diminished the damage.<br /><br />I played the game more than once. However, if I had to change the decisions I took when playing the game for the first time, I would invest more time and resoureces on insurance and research. I believe that there must be a constant and equal distribution in the allocation of resources. Protection, knowledge and insurance must all be taken into consideration in order to be well prepared.<br /><br />If I could add or change one simple thing in this game, I would adapt each level to a different country with different levels of income. Thus, the index of risk preparation across countries could be taken into account when playing the game, and it could be an even better image of reality. On the other hand, if we could only play the game with one place, I would allow the risk manager to have a wider span of decision making: manouvring with incentives, information, behaviors and resources could be very interesting.   </div>
