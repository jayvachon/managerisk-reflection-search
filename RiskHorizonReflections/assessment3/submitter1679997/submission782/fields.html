    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Reflecting on the game money and vision where key factors in the game and the advancement. Risk management was mostly centered on preventing the infrastructure from being ruined or halted from its development and dealing with the after effects of the meteors. When it came to money i was divided between construction of new buildings, improving old ones, buying insurance or some other means of risk prevention. Development was affected both in the long run and the short run, being limited to continuing on a project, fixing an old one, upgrading or starting again. Risk preparation was a limiter to continuing the project but also one that helped it continue after a meteor strike. The times I repeated the game, I built less buildings and focused mostly on research of the meteors, buying insurance and other measures to prevent a large impact on the project. Also the few buildings I made I continued to improve and upgrade them until I had enough money to build smaller and cheaper new ones. As for Risk Management in general it is a constant and never ending process, even after a project is finished. Being constantly ready to notice a possible event that will hinder the place where the project is moving forward. Not only that the stress this causes is considerable which also means that any risk manager must have a clear mind, iron will and sound judgement. It was interesting how the time researching took from the time to build and improve, even when some buildings where already finished. Which I think makes an important point on how to manage ones time when managing risk. The brings me to my second point, the tactics one chooses to create their risk management  strategy does not have to have a lot of elements in it, just a few right ones will do. Not only prioritizing resources but the measures that will prepare one for any event. If I would change the game in any way it would be in the different types of catastrophes that can affect the project, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, heavy rain ect. I would leave the same geographical location for constructing the infrastructure, also I would limit the amount of measures that can be taken after increasing the different things that can be done to prevent a catastrophe. I would expande the research tool to be used on varios factors in the game, in order to make decision making much more challenging and resource managing even  more so. Probably the thing that I would like to add but find difficult, would be human interaction as a form of risk management, like a lawsuit, an accident or shareholder disagreements. A bit complex but those are factors that arise when taking on a task, people as a a source of risk. Not to be negative but it is a real life dilema and learning how to deal with it is something that is not taught in most schools. This factor would make the game more complicated and would not make the player rely to much on the measures of probability and possibility. Relying only on numbers and equations is not enough for good risk management, they are important but relying only on them allows for tunneled vision of the environment one is in.</div>
