    <div class="field-value">I believed this was a very good reflection of the game. The proposal of the change the player would have made to the game seems reasonable and clever; therefore I consider this to be the strength of his/her analysis.

If I should add something to improve the reflection, perhaps it was a bit too brief, though it remained within the word limits. The player could have developed a bit more, for example, on the way in which the shelter could be applied in the game.</div>
