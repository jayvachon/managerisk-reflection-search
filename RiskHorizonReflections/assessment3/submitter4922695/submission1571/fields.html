    <h1>Submission 1571 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4922695, session_user_id: fba94d68dbe9a01a4e6bf644b37cc48a11fbe3a3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played three times, until I got the fifth level and I understand the balance between investing in growing and protecting by investing in insurance and reaching levels. <br />At the end, I realized that without enough protection there was no point in growing in number since I kept investing in rebuilding. So the way of having a growing and safe community was to invest in protection as it grows. Growing should be not only in quantity but in quality to get more financing resource even if better infrastructure costs more to rebuild, it is also more resistant, as we can see the not connected houses suffers even more for not having  community chain.<br /><br />Having better insurance for the more developed buildings also helps financing the high cost they have and those are very important since they lend the higher financing for the rest of the community. Development pull over less developed to higher income levels.<br /><br />I think it would be good to add a human lost factor, and more options for infrastructure such as hospitals, and industries, some with return investment. </div>
