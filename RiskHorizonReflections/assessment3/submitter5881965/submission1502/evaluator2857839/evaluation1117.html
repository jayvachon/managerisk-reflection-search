    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is the student couldn't REALIZE the relation between the game and risk management.In addition,the student didn't use all the tools of the game.The student want to know HOW to manage risk and didn't know how to win on the game.In fact,these facts demonstrate he or she needs more guide in the game to show how to win and remind he or she the relationship between risk management and the game.My advice to the friend is there is a lot for us to learn in the game and you would better doing some research and sumarizing after playing the game.You can ask yourself some question like "what is best strategy in each stage?How do I know the best strategy?How,where ,when do I get the very imformation to make the right decision?And if possible,can I transform the general imformation into data?Can I build a model to calculate it?etc</div>
