    <h1>Submission 451 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7784053, session_user_id: 14f88c44d45fadb8dddc0d9a51fc9d40928dc850)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I played the game a few times: it takes some time to understand the concept of the game and understand what measures impact more on reducing the risk: i.e. insuring the houses,  raising the level of the island to be safe as possible. What weighs more is not clear and only through playing the game a few times one finds out what is more important/weighs more in protecting the community. Also what is the goal (should we make a large community or not?) is not fully clear. 

I firstly and primarily focused on research and probably spent too much money on it. Similarly I spent too much resources on prevention and insurance, limiting the availability of funds to build the community. 

The games is interesting but it is not clear which shock and which risk management measure has bigger impact: i.e. cost efficiency of the different measures (research, protection and insurance) are not clear. The games also provides a simplified way of looking at risk management, which is in real world very complicated as actors do not make rational choices.  It would be interesting having to choose and make decisions in a more realistic settings, considering expenditures of jobs , education, health care etc. 

As it is difficult to reach a higher level than level 3, and considering above comments I do not think it is fair to use the game results as part of the course grades. </div>
