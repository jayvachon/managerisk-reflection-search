    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the student's discussion of their personal experience whilst playing the game, which provided insight in to how the game worked, and how they increased their understanding of risk management. The reflection could have been made better with a little more detail in to how they would use the opportunities that arise out of comet collision to the advantage of the community. That part was very interesting, and it would have been interesting to see it more fleshed out. The student also provided clear paragraph spacing, which was very useful. </div>
