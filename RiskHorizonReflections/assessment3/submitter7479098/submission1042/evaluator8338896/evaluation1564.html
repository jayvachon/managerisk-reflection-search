    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection, I think, consists of two things: 1. clear expressions -- this reflection has a structure where the asked questions were given clear answers to make the idea easy to see. Every question received an answer so the context is complete. 2. good summary -- the game and the idea of risk-management were mixed properly, and the idea of the writer was indicated by the examples in the game. One thing I think would make this reflection better is to cut off parts of the specifics about how the writer used the computer to take measures in the game, for example, "I pressed and holdÂ  the slider, located on the bottom right of the screen, into the upright position to raise the Alora Island.". Because I think the main idea and writer's scheme in playing the game were presented clearly enough, so the specifics seemed to be useless -- we can easily find how to take measures through viewing the game-introduction. All in all, the writer has done well with passion and care. PS: There're some spelling-mistakes, hope the writer can be more conscious the next time:-)</div>
