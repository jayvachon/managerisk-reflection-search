    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is its structured format. I like the way it's first reflecting of the key knowledge of risk management defined in the module, followed by the further explanation of experience and reflection during playing the Risk Horizon game. 

However, things that I think would make this reflection better are:
- instead of a regular step should be done, it's better to explain more on what mistakes that you did, what you have changed as a result of learning from it, what was the result of the changes you've done
- explaining the relevant reflection on learning from the game that can be applied to real life condition
- explaining example of game improvement that may be proposed to reflect more on the risk management in your own country   </div>
