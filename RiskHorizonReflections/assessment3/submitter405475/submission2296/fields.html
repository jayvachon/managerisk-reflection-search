    <h1>Submission 2296 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 405475, session_user_id: 6f3b7232e28a4a7ce30ba6615994fe8dcd2532e6)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The first
time I played the game I could not get past level 1. After re-reading the
instructions, I played four more times, with much better results. I managed to
get to level five twice and to level six also on two occasions. </p>

<p>In the
first times I played, I invested a lot in insurance. Then I realized that a
better strategy is to invest more in development, research and protection, especially
during the early stages of the game. Insurance is useful at levels 5 and 6,
when a larger number of comets appear with higher impact and probability levels.
This aspect can be directly related to everyday life, where it is essential to
focus on obtaining accurate information about the potential risks and take
action to mitigate them, evaluating the decision to purchase insurance in
specific circumstances. </p>

<p>With regard
to the research activity, I find many similarities with the real world.
Although research in the game is related to collect information about potential
risks, I find an interesting relationship with the benefits of carrying out
scientific and technological research in communities: the results of the research
activities are not immediate, and even some research activities will not give
any concrete results (such as the cases where extensive research is done on a
comet that doesn’t hit). However, sustained research activities produce results
that translate into significant benefits for the community. </p>

<p>Another
interesting aspect is related to development. I realized that it is important
to invest in development as soon as possible because these activities sustain the
game’s main indicator. The development demand will increase as the game progresses,
so it's important to achieve a robust development level before reaching levels
5 and 6. </p>

<p>Overall, I
think the game reflects the dynamics that actually take place with respect to
risk management. I think it is an interesting exercise that can be related at
different levels: from the individual, group, organizational, to the regional
or national perspective. </p>

<p><span>I think the
game is a good way to experiment with the balance between research, prevention
and insurance. One of the changes that I would integrate to the game would be
to define different types of activities that could be performed by the
"pods", that is, that the user could select the functions to be
performed by different pods (for example if a pod will be a school, a
productive enterprise, a research center, etc.). That would pose interesting questions
regarding development, as for example: what would happen if there are three
schools, three productive enterprises and no health services? Or what would
happen if there are four big productive enterprises but only one
under-developed school?</span></p></div>
