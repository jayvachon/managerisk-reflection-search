    <h1>Submission 735 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 360802, session_user_id: 39a80d512a7124fb99043bf57fd2a86c63d50ce7)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game was really helpful in making the player understand risk management in a simplified way. In the game advancing the pods are necessary for development and the falling meteors acts as the risk element. It is balance between insurance taken , the research on the meteors and the elevation of the land by protection which will help the player to advance to the next level. The main trade-off is between and the researching a meteor and the protection of the surface. We wont be able to do both together and a lot of time is consumed in this. Taking insurance is a safe method and it will cost to our total resources. I had to play the game at least 10 times to reach level 5 and during each game I experimented on each factors like first using insurance and fast advancement which landed me nowhere, but the next time when i started with a balance in protection and advancement i was able to go much higher levels by buying insurance only when i was sure research will not help or when severity was too high compared to protection . Also the channeling of resources among the pods helped to raise the protection bar because of which in most cases the damage to pods was averted. So for me the takeaway is timely decision along with a balance trade-off in research and protection against a risk help us to manage risk more effectively.<br /></div>
