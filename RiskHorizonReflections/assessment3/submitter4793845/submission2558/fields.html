    <h1>Submission 2558 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4793845, session_user_id: 6a462f97ecea83f7dceb0f07cc7bccdf4b000f34)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game, there was one risk- asteroid impact. To overcome this risk there were options like insurance, knowledge and technology. We had to spend money to obtain a specific amount of insurance. The cost of insurance was quite high. Insuring my infrastructure for 75% proved to be cause of my failure at Level 4. Over insuring an object can hamper growth hence we need to buy an insurance with planning. The same thing applies to protection. The cost of raising the land level is also quite high. You need to balance your budget for protection and insurance! After some time I realized this trade-off : "Too much of protection and insurance can be hazardous to growth". <br />I played the game once and managed to reach level 4. But I made several mistakes which prevented me to reach Level 5. I over-insured my city. Moreover I spent a lot of money on protection. This resulted in dwindling money (resources) which in turn was the reason for my failure. If I played the game again, I would maintain a balance between insurance and protection. Moreover by analyzing the knowledge, I come to a conclusion that for long term gains, protection is better than insurance. By protection you not only reduce the intensity of impact but also you are better prepared for future disasters. Hence I would stress on protection. "A stitch in time saves nine".<br />I would add the option of financial  crisis. In this particular game, your money always grows. By adding the risk of financial crisis, the players would have to save money in banks to be prepared for a bail-out if necessary. Alternatively, players could educate their population about the importance of savings. I live in Mumbai (India), the risks that I face are floods, drought and financial crisis. Floods make people sick my city. So adding the option of epidemic would be beneficial for me. Every year in the monsoon season, thousands of people fall sick by contracting malaria, dengue and stomach illnesses. One more option would be add "Drought". The lack of rainfall which India is facing this year would be represented by that option. <br />My conclusion after playing this game is that you need to know your priorities- it can be either insurance or protection. As I mentioned earlier, for long term benefits, protection is more budget friendly and feasible. Insurance lacks the long term advantage. <br /><br /></div>
