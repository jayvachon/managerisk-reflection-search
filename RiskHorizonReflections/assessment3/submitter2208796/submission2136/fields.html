    <h1>Submission 2136 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2208796, session_user_id: 4176880f329c755932410f7ccb2220f6ee6ede86)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">If I played the game again I would have tried to develop more quick response to the different satelites by being able to foresee their magnitude and get the proper insurance, or, in defect, not investing in building new facilities when its going to be broken very soon. The idea is that we have to build at least 2-3 pods at the beginning so that we could add more and more building to two at the same time at least. Also purchasing an insurance when there are comets is good, because it prevents from big problems. When chances of hit are high is when the investment has to be done already to prevent it, and when the severity is very high too we must follow and buy the insurance to get covered.</div>
