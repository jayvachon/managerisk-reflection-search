    <div class="field-value">Excellent job!! The answers described aspects of risk management in the game in a very clear and comprehensive manner meaning that the concepts have been really well grasped by you. Also the flow of the answers was very smooth and the points well connected which made the reading enjoyable.

I think you could have elaborated a bit more on the first point like how you used a mix of defense tools and insurance to minimize resources and maximize benefits. Also, you could have mentioned how development was inhibited/stalled during the time you were preparing for the risk. A bit more details on what you would have done differently if you played again would have been good.

Very well written overall, but of course there is always room for improvement.</div>
