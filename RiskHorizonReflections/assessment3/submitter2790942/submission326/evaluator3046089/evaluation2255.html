    <div class="field-value"> The key strength of this reflection is that the game does not reflect the crude reality where the communities are very poor.  The important for the community is to survive and the insurance is not so important, but the links between them are very important to survive. The game gives good criteria about the role of research, protection, community, catastrophic event that could be happening at any time and time. The information (research) is crucial to certain communities to survive and to do something else that just to “wait” without knowing what is going on.      </div>
