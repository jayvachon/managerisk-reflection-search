    <h1>Submission 32 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5094759, session_user_id: 80a8709e90cd3563072a9642c8f0441410fb3664)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game we had to fill a development bar by building and upgrading pods. Each pod helped to increase a rate of development. A risk in this game are the comets that strike the planet and cause a damage to the pods and hinder the development of the planet. Every comet had a severity and chance of hit. The longer we research a comet the more accurate the predictions become. In the game we were also able to insure against shocks and Â increase a protection. When I played the game a researched only those comets that had at least 50% of chance of hit in order not to waste time, as it was impossible to research all comets. I didn't use insurance as it covered max of 75% of repairing cost and after building and upgrading most of the pods it was very expensive to pay even 25% percent of the cost and it was hard to fullfil the development bar again. So, I increased protection and only when it was necessary (when there was a large chance for the comet to hit). I played the game once and reached level 7. I would not do anything differently. I received an example of how risk management techniques are used in real life and within real communities. In order for this game to be more realistic and interesting, i recomend to developers to create some different kinds of natural disasters and different kinds of protection against them.<br /></div>
