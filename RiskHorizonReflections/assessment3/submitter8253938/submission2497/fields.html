    <div class="field-value"><span>It is generally believed that an effective and responsible risk management consisting of preparation before shocks and coping afterwards is an essential tool for development. the community Allora was faced with a major setback/risk which was capable of reducing the possibility of development. Now while I played the game,I realized that risk management was an important tool that was to be used in the community.Since risk management is effective when there is a capacity to prepare in advance and cope afterwards,the three main tools which is knowledge,protection and insurance must walk hand in hand.but to enhance development,you need to be financially stable. The three main tools must work together to achieve an effective risk management,as these tools were applied in the game.first,knowledge must me applied,knowledge in form of research,and then protection is applied to shield when an actual shock takes place,insurance is then put in place to help compensate after a shock has been materialized..</span><br /></div>
