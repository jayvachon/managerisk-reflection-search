    <div class="field-value">The author of this reflection clearly played the game several times and understands how to succeed at the game by marshalling and deploying resources evenly. The author's key strength was in how s/he described different approaches to the three mitigation measures and how these could be balanced to mitigate risk while encouraging development. I think this reflection would be better if the author thought more about ways that this game could be more realistic within the framework of existing game plan. For example, adding elements like crime, disease, and financial crisis would make the game extremely complicated, particularly since the game in its current format is an extremely simplified form of risk management. What are some small changes that can be made to the current game to make it more realistic?</div>
