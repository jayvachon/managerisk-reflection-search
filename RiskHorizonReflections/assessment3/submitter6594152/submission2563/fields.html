    <h1>Submission 2563 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6594152, session_user_id: 15162183a71af129a66beea0d3383f90d6dc12ba)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I thoroughly enjoyed playing the Risk Horizon game as it
helped refined my risk management skill-set. 
Two words immediately come to my mind when I consider the gaming experience:  diversification and multi-tasking.  When I began playing the game, I recalled  from the World Development Report that it
would take a diverse set of risk management strategies in order to succeed, so
I tried all of my options in the game. Knowledge, protection, and insurance
were all mandatory techniques for me.  I remembered
that all opportunity must be considered as well as all risk, so I immediately
started building communities in order to advance my income level.  Once new communities were built, and my income
level was sufficient, I upgraded them immediately, as I knew that upgrades
would increase my rate of return on development.  Despite the fact that I started with the goal
of rapid development as my upmost priority, I was well aware of the potential loss
I could incur from a comet impact.  I
tempered the rate at which I built new communities in the first two levels and
spread out my income spending by purchasing the highest level of insurance and
raising my communities to prevent damage from comet impact.  When my income was depleted from the
spending, I thought that I would be best time to focus on researching incoming
comets as that required no additional income.  
I primarily alternated between researching comets and raising the communities.
Where the comets had a low probability of impact when they were halfway across
the sky, I ceased research activity.  If
there was more than one comet I focused on the first comet until I reached at
least 3 indication bars and then focused on the additional comets.  When a comet was more than 3/4ths of
the way across the sky and destined for impact, I made sure I had at least 4
bars of research towards it. Despite attention given to protection and
knowledge, I did not keep rapid development out of mind for I built new
communities and made upgrades as my income level surpassed a certain
threshold.   My tactics proved to be consistently
successful which the key indicator that my risk management mechanism was quite
effective.</p>

<p>I played the game several times, and adapted my strategies
each time I played.  The first time I
lost the game was playing on Level 3 when I was overly concerned with protection
and knowledge that I did not meet the required level to move to Level 4.  I altered my strategy so that I would develop
faster—building more communities and upgrading them more.  I used my income level as an indication meter—if
I had more than $600, I felt as if I was underutilizing my development
resources. </p>

<p>Overall, I was impressed by the gameplay and game design
however if I were re-designing the game, I would place more of an emphasis on
infrastructural development and the acquisition of knowledge.  I found the communication period between
communities after a comet impact to be quite unrealistic—not being ability to
distinctly measure its utility in the game. 
Also, I felt as if comet research should realistically cost an income
amount in the gameplay.  An additional
suggestion would be encouraging building infrastructural connections between communities
to strengthen resources of protection and institutions that would increase and
sustain knowledge.</p>
