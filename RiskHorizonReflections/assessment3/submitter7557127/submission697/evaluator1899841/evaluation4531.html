    <div class="field-value">The strongest part, in my humble opinion, is your reference to the situation several small island states face already face today. I love that comparison, because it makes very clear how important the issue is. Although 400 words is not much, I think that your short essay was lacking substance. I find it, however, interesting that you acknowledge, you haven't really put in any consideration in what you were doing, but instead just gave everything a try. Yet, you recognized that a more nuanced (strategized) approach would be necessary in order to protect your developing community. Overall, a good and well written essay.</div>
