    <div class="field-value">This reflection shows very accurately what the student has learned from the game and how the process of the game developed. 
The role of protection is described too briefly in my opinion and some sentences are not easy to understand . But the student has captured the overall meaning of the risk management. The development upgrade is investing in development not investing in knowledge like sentence number four in the student reflection said.  
The risk management choices in a developing country gave an intresting view of the game and the examples in this context were relevant. The student could describe more closely what is meant by structural economics.</div>
