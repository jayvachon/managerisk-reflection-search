    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1. Role of risk management in the game is that how I choose the insurance plan (33%, 50% or 75%) for the pod I have. I must calculate or guess how much I need to prepare if the fireball hit my place. And the trade-offs here is that, I wait for the fireball come near to my planet, and choose the insurance plan which is most suitable with the percentage of hitting; however sometimes I buy a high insurance plan but there is no damage or less damage, and it is somekind of wasting money.<br /><br />2. The first time I try, or can be said in case if I have only one chance to play, I try to save money to increase my pod level as high as possible. For example, I create 3-4 pod, then upgrade 2 to level 2, and then wait for enough money to upgrade the 3rd one and so on. However, if the fireball hits the planet, the cost is so high even I pay for the insurance (even 33% or 50%). That is why from the 3rd time, I try to cut of the waste time, at the time all of the pod upgrade, I will upgrade or create the new pod right away. It depends on how much money I have at this time. Also the insurance, at the time the fireball nearly hits my planet, I will choose the highest insurance that fits my current money. The thing I learn in this game is how to save time also money for upgrading and buying insurance.<br /><br />3. If I can change one simple thing, I will add the rocket to destroy the fireball. With the fixed price for the rocket, I will think about whether buy rocket or not after comparing its price with the insurance. <br /></div>
