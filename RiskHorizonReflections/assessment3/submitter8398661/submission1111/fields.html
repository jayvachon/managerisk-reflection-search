    <h1>Submission 1111 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8398661, session_user_id: 17a42ecec7500539e439a0cc598916080f1029f3)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The aim of
the game is to develop island in a certain amount of time and with a certain
amount of money. In order to be successful, I also have to take in consideration
the risk of damages caused by the comets that may crash on the island. I can
study this <b>risk</b> through a tool that
allows me to <i>analyse comets’ trend</i>,
in order to <b>decide how to use my
resources</b> (time and money) to reaching the highest level of development.</span></p>

<p>Through this
window, I am able to know the ‘Chance of hit’ and the ‘Severity’ of the impact
of the nearby comets and to take a strategic protection:</p>

<p><span>- in case of a <i>low</i> ‘Chance of
hit’ and ‘Severity’ I spend money to <b>develop</b>
the island, saving time;</span></p>

<p><span>- in case of <i>high</i> ‘Chance of
hit’ or ‘Severity’ I spend time to <b>monitor</b>
the situation, saving money in order to buy an insurance and cope with the
consequences of the impact, i.e. restoration. Moreover, in this way I was able
to decrease the loss of time through the accumulation of “extra time” provided
to reduce damages.</span></p>

<p><br /></p><p>Since the
time is not enough to both develop and monitor the risk, I need to balance
these two actions. The first time I played, I mainly focused on quick expansion
and, so, I was not successful because I invested all the money in developing
instead of saving some of them for protection scope. </p>

<p><span>These
experiences led me to efficiently <b>trade-off</b>
between monitoring and developing. In particular, I followed a <b><i>via
media</i></b><i>:</i></span></p>

<p><i>- I did not developed the buildings too quick
in order to have money for insurance and for lifting the island, but on the
other hand</i></p>

<p><span>- I tried <i>not to over-use insurance</i>, leaving money
for the development and the lifting of the island and, in the meantime, </span></p>

<p><span>- I tried <i>not to over-lift the island</i>, in order to
save money and earn time to monitor comets’ trend.</span></p>

<p><br /></p><p>While in the
first round I used to invest most of my resources in developing, with
unsuccessfully results, in the second round I decided to invest a higher part
of it also in insurance. In fact, I
understood that only a <b>long-term
strategy</b> can lead me to the goal, because the short-term approach gave me non-lasting
results.</p>

<p><span>In this
view, when I was satisfied by the development I didn’t risk everything keeping
on building, but I stop the expansion to focus on the protection: I spent time
in <i>monitoring comets</i> and I spent
money in <i>lifting the island as well</i>. </span></p>

<p> </p>

<p><span>Thanks to
these different attempts, I have learnt that it is not important to obtain fast
successful results, if they will easily vanish later. As consequence, when I want
to reach a goal I have to <b>know</b> which
are the risks and <b>monitor</b> them,
to <b>find</b> <b>the</b> <b>right trade-off</b> able
to lead me to success.   </span></p>

<p><span>Since a lot of real risks are
unexpected, I would supplement the game with a <b>tsunami</b>, in order to teach how to <i>organise</i> resources to be always ready to cope with the consequences
of also unpredictable events.</span></p></div>
