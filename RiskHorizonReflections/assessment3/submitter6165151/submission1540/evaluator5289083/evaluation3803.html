    <div class="field-value">The author understood the moral of the game; the following elements of risk management ( knowledge, protection and insurance) must be balance throughout the implementation of risk management. The suggestion to include the "environment cost of the development action" is brilliant.  The essay presented is good however, to improve on the refection  the author should have mentioned a change which  better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place he/she live sch as soft risk management instruments..</div>
