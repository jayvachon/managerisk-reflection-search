    <div class="field-value">The reflection draw very beautiful parallel of risk management between the game and real life. It is also quiet comprehensive bring out the parallel for all principles of risk management. I my opinion this reflection is okay except it does not really make any suggestion for the game improvement. Perhaps this pal find the the risk game perfect. </div>
