    <h1>Submission 1639 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 2548769, session_user_id: 39891171d40c9e695da850a32ef4dbcb00b2ce0a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game is to create a world with its
protection and ability to stand against natural disaster by mitigating risks
using benefit-cost analysis. The key risk comes from external environment such
as comets that falling in water creating a flood. Thus the main problem is to
organize risk mitigation in time without underestimating or overestimating the
risk, that is</p>

<p><span>1       
</span>Knowledge - Make a
good research, describe the coming risk, its force of influence and its
probability, this is very important as the research information is one of the
key factors for decision making during preparation process.</p>

<p><span>2       
</span>Describe the types of
protection and cost of that type of protection, for instance buying only
insurance or only rise up protection level, or both of them, or none of them,
assess and compare the costs of them, as it can be non affordable and the
damage impact and its recovery can be less costly than insurance cost or other
type of protection costs.</p>

<p><span>3       
</span>Make a decision with
available research under confident information and financial constraints for
making good coping to sustain future negative shocks. </p>

<p><span>Taking into account above mentioned steps I have rose up protection
level for the first two levels and use no insurance, as insurance cost was
immediate cost and I had financial constraints while the probability of damage
or its influence force isn’t so high and in case of damages the recovery is
less costly than middle insurance cost so I decide to accept and carry the risk
negative effects by myself for low levels. For the third and fourth levels I have
used both insurance and protection consequently with using balance idea. In
preparation period I have risen up protection which effect is immediate but  in the middle of the level have bought
insurance for  being able to use it in case of crash and all these steps enable me to tolerate the upcoming comets
negative impacts without caring serious losses. </span></p>

<p>In the beginning of game I took too much attention to preparation
process, I bought insurance and rose the protection level too much so during
the first two tries I failed the game as paid most of money on protection. Then
I began to work more carefully and wisely, step by step I began describe the
upcoming comet nature, its probability of crash and influence of force. And
made the decision to use the insurance in high levels while level by level I
rose the protection level. By other words I have created a robust analysis
model to overcome the obstacle and mitigate the risk.</p>

<p><span>And at the end I would offer to include in the game other type of
disaster such as typhoons, hurricanes, heavy rains. All this will make us to
think more quickly and precisely. </span></p></div>
