    <h1>Submission 589 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8094286, session_user_id: 9ed0cbcf608a80b6bc4eff153db5e5f6cb0ff7c1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><div>The game is a learning exercise for making decisions in constraints of time and money, just that risk management is about. In this game, information plays a major role allowing decisions before and after the harmful event occurred. The probabilities, the protection costs and the predicted damage should be quantified to achieve good performance in risk management.</div><div><br /></div><div>After playing a few times, the experience also takes center stage as it allows better decisions. That is, <b>knowledge</b> of the threats and the value of endangered goods are both fundamental.Â </div><div><br /></div><div>I would not add things to the game, because they would increase the complexity and therefore the exercise would become more difficult for the general public. I just would improve the instructions for easy access to children, housewives and many other people in the world who need to understand risk management through educational games.</div></div>
