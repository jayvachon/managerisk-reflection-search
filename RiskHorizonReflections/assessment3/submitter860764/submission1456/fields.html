    <h1>Submission 1456 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 860764, session_user_id: 9cbbb950b2732ba5e47a9c05beb56830c55c249e)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The game forces trade-offs between knowledge of the comets, protection rising above the sea level and insurance against damage cause by the comets. It was important to trade-off the time spent of gaining knowledge with the time spent developing the community and raising the level of the community to protect against tsunamis. Additionally, there was a trade-off between the cost of higher level insurance with the cost of developing the community.<br /><br />If I played the game again, I would build all of the Level 1 pods prior to moving on to develop any of the pods to Level 2. The additional support of an extended community would have provided allowed a quicker recovery from comet impacts. The key thing that I learned was to establish which of the comets it was worthwhile sacrificing time on to gain knowledge and which should be primarily disregarded. Additionally, as the community developed further, higher levels of insurance were required due to the more costly consequences of comet impact.<br /><br />A key aspect that I would change to better represent risk management choices where I live would be to increase the cost of re-building the pods &amp; community.</div>
