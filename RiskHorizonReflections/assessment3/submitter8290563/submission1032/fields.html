    <h1>Submission 1032 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8290563, session_user_id: c71e0f125d17c9b3d70a566a188dfb58373f2818)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.      
- The role of risk management in the game is how
to make a community develop through a lot of risk, made by the comet. </p>

<p>          - During the game, I already chose the functions: Research,
Protection and Insurance to finish the tasks. </p>

<p>          - At beginning of the game, I always choose Insurance which
can cover 70% to have highest return when accident occurs.</p>

<p>          - When facing with hazard, as a comet coming, I use the
Research to know its “severity” &amp; “Chance of hit”.</p>

<p>                 + If the level of “severity”
&amp; “Chance of hit” are so high, I immediately take Protection to minimize the
damage status if accident happens or make the comet miss my community.</p>

<p>                 + If the level of “severity”
&amp; “Chance of hit” are very low, I see that no need to use “Protection” to
save money and build more building to earn much more money.</p>

<p>2.      
- I played game again and again after the first
time, maybe 10 times until I won level 4.</p>

<p>          - In the next times, I focus to control the condition of the
game, via Research, I can estimate the damage if it hits my community. If the
level of risk is so high, I must use Protection to lift the ground higher to
minimize or prevent damage. If the level so low, instead of using Protection, I
build or upgrade the existing building to earn more money. </p>

<p>          - The main things I learn in this game are “if you want to
develop, you must manage the risk strictly &amp; balance with building an
opportunity to grow up!” If you only focus on Protection, you may lose some
chances to improve yours, it’s a pity. But if you only have action for
development without conducting risk assessment and find out some efficiently
way to manage, you would face of a lot of accidents that can destroy all of what
you’re trying to do or even that it can make Economic Crisis, claim people life
and more than that.</p>

<p>3.       - If I can make a new version of this game, I’d to
add rain- drought &amp; flood issues as different hazard to people life and
their harvest. </p>

<p>          -The hazard in the game, the coming comet, is still OK but how
many time people in this Global must face with it? So in my opinion, we’re
better change hazard to others such as storm, flood, drought,… and I think it’s
much more realistic. </p>

<p>          - I
live in Viet Nam, a tropical climate country, year by year facing with storms,
floods so I recommend that add more Protection agencies as dikes, dams to
manage hazards to protect people &amp; harvest.</p></div>
