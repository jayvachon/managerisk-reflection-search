    <h1>Submission 1586 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6224812, session_user_id: f9c8106b92ba78d3fcac67152d9c8bc6b30a6574)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">In the game, the role of risk management was me. I took the place of policy maker, and I would make decision on how to protect my pods. I make balance among knowledge, protection, and insurance. I considered two main problems, how much of my money spend on development by building and upgrading pods and how much of my money to spend on preparation for risk by purchasing insurance, protecting pods by raising the level of my community, or researching the probability and severity of comets <span>coming towards the community across the horizon. At first, I developed my pods </span>immediately, and then I kept my pods not more than 5, and developing them to keep protection. When comets came, I would learn it and bought insurance or protecting it.<br /><br />If I played the game only once, I may follow my heart, and keeping on development. I believed that development was most important. And if I played more than once, I would consider more things, for example, I would protect and buy insurance. That's because for only once, I didn't know the difficulty, when I know the difficulty, I would do more things to keeping on the game. In the game, developing was important, no development, it would not win the level, but meanwhile, when the risk came, if I didn't take actions, maybe I would lose more and eventually lost the game. Development and protection were both of significance.<br /><br />If I got the chance to develop a new version of the game. I would take the pods built into account. How the pods located is also important for risk management. Different location would cause different problems. I would focus on the difference, pods are different, insurance are different. Then the game will be more difficulty and more closed to true world.</div>
