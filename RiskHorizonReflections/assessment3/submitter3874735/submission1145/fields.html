    <h1>Submission 1145 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3874735, session_user_id: 70bb7d3c15a1066c01ce487bb1e1eaff795a86ff)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game protection helped most, then insurance and knowledge
helped in preparation. All three components were of great use but I feel measures
taken to mitigate risk were most effective and so knowledge. More advanced pods
you have less the damage and less efforts to re-establish them. Spending on
research and having some information upfront helped in making decisions
regarding the allocation of resources between insurance and protection. Also,
it helped in addressing specific pod to lower damage. Preparedness and Protection
measures were best ways to mitigate risk. So, I focused more on constructing
pods and maintaining them and stuck with 50% insurance. I used knowledge to
understand severity and chances of HITS. Preparation helped both immediately and
after the hit. Well prepared pods reduced the probability and size of losses
and they also the maintenance costs were pretty less after hits. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>I f I will play again, I
will focus more on understanding risk and based on that I will upgrade my pods.I guess, risk cannot be
mitigated by general precautions (making all pods and upgrading them because
you have limited funds). One should apply knowledge to understand shocks and
its intensity and based on that use potent measures to recover from losses and make
the most benefits out of those protection measures. Insurance too help in
coping after risk. It requires strategic approach where you have to logically understand
the possible risk and allocate your resources in promising manner.</p>

<p><span>I guess game depicts major aspects of risk management
considering the fact that it delivers message of risk management in a very simplified
and effective way. In the game, I will add option of planting trees and digging
ponds. Trees will certainly help in absorbing shock and ponds will help in managing
water overflow from the sea due to hits. In my area, I will promote people to
people connect. In addition to Knowledge, Protection, Insurance and Coping,
what can significantly help in mitigating risk is interpersonal relation among
people of a community i.e. community feeling. Connected people can reach to a
consensus about preparedness and implementation of pre risk activities smoothly
and efficiently. As highlighted in the course, one of the biggest obstacle is
willingness to pay attention beforehand i.e. procrastination. With community
feeling, well informed people can not only collaborate and minimize the risk
but can help each other; coping the risk with sense of togetherness. Risk
management can be effective with participation whether it is in preparedness or
coping.</span></p></div>
