    <h1>Submission 29 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6982366, session_user_id: a4d5750fc7c6155242627ee182641a50dad7ddca)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The role of risk management in the game is simple: to
develop a society in relatively harsh and risky conditions where a single
natural disaster (a comet with high impact) could induce massive damage. Personally, I chose to
focus on rapid development in combination with extreme protection (within my
budget, of course) – almost no matter how devastating the disaster was, the
damage was always none to very minimal, allowing me to focus on further
development, occasionally purchasing insurance in the event of a high-impact,
high-likelihood disaster. There were some large initial costs and my
development was slow at the start, but over the course of the game, my strategy
paid off and given my high protection and low damage losses, I was able to set
off on a very fast and large-scale development. </p>

<p>This was, however, the second time I was playing it. The
first time I was trying to combine all of the measures at once, and it was extremely
costly and preventing a lot of development, eventually not succeeding in the
end. Therefore, the second time, I chose to focus on one predominant way of
managing risk (protection), complementing it with insurance, and only briefly
and very shortly focusing on research only to assess very
high-risk/high-likelihood events. </p>

<p>I learned that focusing on only one aspect of risk management
can be very deceiving and not effective, but also, on the other hand, spending
scarce resources on everything at once was very disorganized and not effective either.
In other words, prioritizing and focusing on basic ways of managing the risk in
the game, complementing it with simple use of one other method was the most
effective, conducive to development, and, effectively, the good middle-ground. </p>

<p>My proposal to the game would be to add the fourth component
of risk management mentioned in the course videos – i.e. the ability to cope
with the effect of disasters and build resilience. Maybe that would add another
interesting dimension to the game and give way to being able to reduce vast
damage during massive-scale disasters (comets) that none of the current three
methods of risk management in the game could prevent – that is what actually
ended my game: a full-scale damage comet inflicted very big damage to my
well-developed city from which I was not able to recover even with good
insurance and excellent protection. Here, I believe, only resilience would
help. </p></div>
