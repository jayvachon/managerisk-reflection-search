    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>I enjoyed playing this game. the role of risk management in the game is: research, insurance,building and long term protection. my choices was to build in time between risks, research in the time that needed to build. until the next risk is upper i increaseÂ  protection level. the difference between playing once and playing more than once is more understanding of the roles. The main things i learned is fast action and take the chance to build in parallel with research. i'll change the stops of screen, cause the research and make the protection level related with the chance of risk fall</p><br /><br /><br /></div>
