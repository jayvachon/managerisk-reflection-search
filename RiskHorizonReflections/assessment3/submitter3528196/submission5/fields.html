    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk is the possibility of a loss while risk management describes the process of confronting risks, preparing for them, and coping with their effects. In the Game, my task was to protect my community of Alora from destruction from natural disasters. In order to accomplish this objective, i had to research the types of potential disasters that could destroy my community. From the research i found out that my neighborhood has the risk of being destroyed from comets and other objects from the outer space. With this knowledge, I sought out how the community could be protected from these uncertainties. I provided this information to all the stakeholders . I proposed that something like a comet shied be built so that it can intercept or destroy any comets or such objects that might be coming from the outer  space. This was a very expensive project that required funding from multiple sources. The community obtained insurance to mitigate the risk. We pooled our resources so that we were able to obtain the insurance coverage. If i am giving an opportunity to develop a new version of the game, I will enable it to be played in different languages , in addition to providing a  variety  of risks that one can experience. </div>
