    <div class="field-value">This essay is very nice and demonstrates the ability of a person to analize experience gained. It is very well detailed and objective. However, it would be better to generalize a little bit more the experience gained and to provide conclusions made. Besides, it is very well that the essay is structured according to the questions raised in the task. However, the general essay strusture and cohesion means between paragraphs like linking words etc. are lacking, that is why it is not so easy to read the content and keep all points in the mind. In general, it is good.
