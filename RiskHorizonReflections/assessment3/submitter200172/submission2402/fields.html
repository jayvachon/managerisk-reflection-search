    <h1>Submission 2402 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 200172, session_user_id: 27ea4aa577afeee3f55653f0962a61c744f80eb5)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The performance of the writer in the game illustrates some of the perils of risk management. A reasonable assessment of the failure to pass round 4 can be ascribed to excessive use of risk management techniques. The costs of risk management for the writer have exceeded the benefits gained from these techniques and drained precious resources, which could, therefore, not be accumulated fast enough to pass round 4. 

The writer used both preventive measure and risk transfer measures to offset comet risk, investing heavily into raising the level of the pod village and purchasing, initially, level 1 insurance, which was eventually upgraded to level 2 insurance. The excessive risk prevention and mitigation (transfer) costs have drained cashflow from the pod village and resulted in a loss during level 4 of the game, as the costs of risk management, which had decreasing marginal returns per dollar spent, exceeded the returns and thus resulted in missed investment opportunities (the opportunity cost of investing into risk management was decreased/slower investment into building/improving/upgrading the village. 

The lesson learnt for the future is not to skimp on risk management expenditure, but to delay some of the expenditure, so that it can be invested into growth, until the asset values reach a level, where investment into additional risk management provides a benefit that exceeds the value at risk times the probability of the risk occurring.
