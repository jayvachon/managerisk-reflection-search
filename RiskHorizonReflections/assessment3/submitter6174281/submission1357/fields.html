    <h1>Submission 1357 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 6174281, session_user_id: 6a055750483431e26a779f406325442598bd4b0c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>In the game, the role of risk management was to mitigate the
damage to the pods that were caused by the comets. This was in an attempt to
improve the benefits of growth and prosperity for the pods with the aim of
growing and improving the benefits to the community.  I made the choice to always make sure I bought
the highest amount of insurance as possible, even if this meant increasing the
number of pods at a slower rate. At first, a trade-off that I made in terms of
knowledge was that I did not understanding how to connect communities or the
importance of connecting communities to increase the development bar. In terms
of protection, I therefore made the choice to forgo the use of community
connections to increase my development bar, in exchange for a higher amount of
insurance which I paid for with money. There were times, however, that I did
have to buy cheaper insurance as I could not afford the more expensive
insurance whilst also growing pods. I initially found that I prepared too much
with the purchasing of insurance and research and as a result, did not make
enough pods to win the first few games I played. </p>

<p>If I played the game only once, I would focus less on
protection and insurance and more on growing more pods. I would also do more
research to enable me more time to build communities. This stems from the main
thing I learned from the game, which is the importance of including community
and strengthening community to ensure that if a risk does become a reality,
there is a greater chance that the community will pull together, create a team  and work together to survive. I also
appreciated how people would be more willing to take more risks if they have
insurance backing their actions and that taking more risks leads to greater
opportunities to grow and develop. </p>

<p>If I could change one thing in the game, I would involve the
concept of ‘incentives’ which is an obstacle to managing risk. I would have
different scenarios which the game presents to the game player and require the
player to choose an outcome. For example, a scenario where the player is a government
official or a private company owner who are tasked with influencing how the
game will proceed and how their actions will affect risk management.   </p>
