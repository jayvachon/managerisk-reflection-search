    <div class="field-value">Key strength
There is actually nothing I can describe as a key strength. However, the writers efforts are admirable and so is his/her honesty.
Improving the reflection
I think if the writer links the concepts of the game with real world issues, the reflection could be enhanced.

Personal advise to the writer
I think "by trying often, the monkey learn to jump from tree to tree without falling". 
My only advise to the writer is that, he/she should not give up. He or she should still trying playing the game again, focusing more on striking a balance between how he/she develops,  whiles acquiring knowledge (research), insuring his/her developments and protecting them from damage.
Remember it is always better to focus on results (what you can learn and apply to improve you life from the course) than rewards (grades)
Thank you.</div>
