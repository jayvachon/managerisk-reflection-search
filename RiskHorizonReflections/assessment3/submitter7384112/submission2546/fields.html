    <h1>Submission 2546 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7384112, session_user_id: bb58c47125fad9f72633d5528bf2aa23fc281ba1)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">This game really frustrated me.<br />To be frank, I had tried to play the game more than 30 times, and only succeed to reach level 2.<br />Most of the time, I had failed in level 1. <br />I had read and re read again and again the tutorial, and played using all the available tools interchangeable, but still could not pass level 2. Hence, I only get 5 % for this game segment in week 2. <br />I really am dissatisfied with this particular game, and can say that I still cannot understand it.<br />I am sorry, because I want to do well in this course. Last week quiz I got 15 out of 15, so I do not think that I should disappoint myself this week.<br />Anyway, I hope there will be a better risk game in the future, if you choose to include any game in this course.<br />Thank you. <br /></div>
