    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1 - I found this game to be very interesting!  The role of risk management in this game is to weigh the options available to you (do I protect against damage from occurring?  do I insure to reduce my losses when damage does occur?  do I minimize development to in turn minimize the impact of damage?) to gain a successful outcome.  It would be intriguing to watch different individuals approach this game in different ways to assess risk tolerance.   I immediately recognized my tendency to over-protect and over-insure as I went through many meteor hits without any damage.  My preparation for risk by using the protection and insurance items allowed me to build up money while researching coments and continue to develop my pods.  I also found myself trading off when to research one meteor over another, and would get caught up on the research of two high-intensity meteors and realize at the last minute that I wanted to increase my insurance when I could tell damage was highly likely.  For a slow-paced game, I felt like I was making very quick decisions about the best ways to avoid or reduce damage!<br /><br />2 - The first time I played, I was hesitant to keep building and found myself focusing on research and protection, then I suddenly lost in level 3!  I thought I was doing well because I was sustaining no damage, but didn't recognize that my pace of development had slowed to the point that I could not reach the goal line in the last 15 seconds or so.  The next time I played, I paid careful attention to keep developing the pods I built, and once I was feeling secure in the level of protection I had gained, I ended up building pods in all available spots.  I was still careful not to develop them all to a great extent so that I could keep enough protection and afford any insurance to help minimize the cost of repair.  I still was surprised when I lost the second time in level 5 because I thought everything was on solid footing and my tube was green for the entire span until just at the very end.  I wish I could replay the last 30 seconds because I'm still not sure what happened, but I suspect it was once again focusing on protection and research, while losing sight of the development potential.<br /><br />3 - If I were to change one thing about the game, it would be to vary the level of protection or offer a secondary type of protection.  In real life, we often have a variety of ways to protect ourselves against risk and we have to balance which are the best options (like diversifying a portfolio of protection options).  So perhaps the game would allow an opportunity to build shelters over the most developed pods, which would increase the protection for the most expensive upon damage.  That would allow you to purchase less insurance to cover the rest, but insure the largest loss potential more specifically.  My second time playing, I developed a few pods at first and kept upgrading them, then went back to build several others.  The end result was that about half my pods were highly developed by the end - and therefore highly expensive if they became damaged - so I was wishing for a way to protect those few, and pay lower insurance "premiums" on the rest.  I suppose this is similar to a high deductible health plan where we can elect greater insurance against the biggest losses, but accept the smaller losses as easier to handle financially.</div>
