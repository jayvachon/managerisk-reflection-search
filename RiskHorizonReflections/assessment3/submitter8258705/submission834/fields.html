    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1) The Risk Horizon game emphasizes the
importance of risk management to get healthy development. Because of the falling
comets, it is mandatory to adopt risk management tools (knowledge, protection,
and insurance) to guarantee the strong development of the community. However, preparation
for risk can undermine development because risk management costs resources and
time that could be used to develop the community. An important lesson of the
game is that community cannot survive without producing resources. At the beginning
of the game, it is more important to develop the community by building and
upgrading pods than invest in risk management tools. However it is mandatory to
build progressively all the foundations for risk management that you need to
manage the potential shocks that hinder development.</p><p> 2) I played this game twice: the first time,
I was focused on managing the risk and I forgot about developing the community.
The second time, I adopted a more balanced position between growing measures on
the one hand and risk management instruments on the other hand. I already talked about the importance of resources for risk management highlighted in this game.The Risk Horizon game also
emphasizes the existence of a block of risk management tools: knowledge,
protection and insurance. It is impossible to accomplish two actions at the
same time and trade-offs have to be made. Thanks to knowledge, it is possible
to get information about the risks and adopt the best risk management tool
against it. It is then possible to take an insurance or protection. In the game,
the risk of falling comets is too high to use insurance as a permanent
solution. Another lesson of the game was that: “when the risk is high and frequent,
insurance is not a solution. Only protection can take care of very repeated and
frequent risks”. But the game also showed that not all the shocks should be
prevented.  If we dedicate all the
resources get the best protection available against the risk, it is impossible
to develop the community.  In that case
it is more efficient to cope afterwards and tools as insurance can help facilitate
a quick response following the shock. Another lesson of the game is that: “the
more advanced and expensive is a technology, the higher is the price to insure it
and protect it against risks.</p><p> 3) If I had to develop a new version of the
game, I would include some risks impossible to anticipate. It would better
represent the risk management choices that have to be done. Indeed, risk
management is not only about expected and anticipated risks. It is impossible
to anticipate everything. That is the reason why it is important to put in place
processes to keep flexibility and ability to react to unexpected things and
cope afterwards.<br /></p><p><span> <br /></span></p></div>
