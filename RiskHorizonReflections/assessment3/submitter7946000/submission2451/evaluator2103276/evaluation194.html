    <div class="field-value">I share the same experience with this reflection and therefore I can very much relate to the pains and struggles the went through it.  Thus, I think the key strength of this reflection is its ability to narrate the process that I have gone through in the game.  The reflection could have been better if there are quantitative descriptors, such as the time it takes to reach level 2 and the number of attempts to reach level 4, the different variables that have to be dealt with and the behavior of each variable.</div>
