    <h1>Submission 2451 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7946000, session_user_id: 17de15668c1685b96e06827ca1db3653e52fe12c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">There is a clear relevance and "connect" between the game and risk management. I do really think that the game were really specially design for the course, for more appreciation and understanding of the subject matter. The game is indeed very challenging as you really need to explore and read necessary details and instruction for you to fully "operationalize" all the commands and settings of the game. It is indeed true that Knowledge, protection and insurance needs to be in balance as if one has been overly prioritized other will indeed be compromised. Thus it is important to really know what you are dealing with, specially in knowing the "risk" (which in the game the comet falling on the water that will make a possible tidal wave or some sort of a storm surge or tsunami to the pod community), for you to know up to what extent you are preparing for or onto how big is your expected damaged and or how much will be your needed resources to be able to cope with its impact. I think it is also very important to really work in a holistic manner, what i'm trying to say is that, we should always consider the aspects of development specially in looking and planning for the risk we are about to encounter. <br /><br />I have played the game for a couple of times, to be able to achieve a higher level, because it is really quite difficult specially in dealing with higher stage of the game. and every time i start, i am looking for possible strategy on how would i be able to work on measures to achieve te goal for each stages. Oftentimes, I almost finished and reached the goal yet all of a sudden another comet strikes and eventually costs me to loss the game. Thus, in this game it is really important to be focused and be diligent on what is coming for you to be able to be prepared for it. You really need to look and do a "research" for this comet, its severity of impact, its probability of impact to the community to be able to plan well, and so as to be able to increase your protection and buy an immediate insurance that will some how mitigate or reduce the impact of the disaster. <br /><br />I think it will be best represented if we could develop a projected scenario our communities, for example a riverine or seaside communities preparing for possible tsunami or storm surge, it is i think best as we could not try to imaging a community like pods which somehow reflects to be unrealistic. I just want to suggest maybe if it is possible to develop it in a way that it can actually captures an actual risk scenario with a particular community, consider about a certain population, with this kind of resources, and somehow with this current level of development. Thus, from that we could somehow be able to project possible losses and create future plans to cater to the need of the community. Though it will be more complicated to do, yet i think with that we can maximize our critical analysis and capacity for developing program initiatives that will cater to the need of each specific communities at risk. We could also put some parameters or qualifiers if you want a community that have risk for earthquakes, or maybe that of a tsunami or that of communities prone to land slides, wild fires, or maybe to volcanic eruptions among others. This would somehow help us to also assess our understanding and current capacity to assess on this matters concerning risks and opportunities. </div>
