    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is in the way it is related to real world scenarios. From his/her examples, it shows that author clearly understands the rudiments of risk management. The reflection, however, would have been better if it they had been more aligned with the guide questions. I was expecting, for example, one or two suggestions on the game itself in the end, but the author seemed to have not addressed it. Overall, though, the reflection is quite informative and enlightening.</div>
