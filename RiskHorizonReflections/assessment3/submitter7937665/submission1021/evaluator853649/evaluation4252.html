    <div class="field-value">The student's suggestion that what we choose to focus on (with respect to knowledge, coping etc.)  says something about our biases is very insightful. I had never looked at the game in that light until now. I appreciate the student's mention of his or her personal experience living in a flood-prone region. 
I failed to understand what the student meant by "making the game more complex while you are leveling up" and how that would "help embrace the matrix thinking." I thought the game was already complex as it was each time the island was raised.</div>
