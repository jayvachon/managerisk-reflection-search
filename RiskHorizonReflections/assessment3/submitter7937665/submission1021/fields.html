    <h1>Submission 1021 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7937665, session_user_id: ba4f5b29e455e5012f0b357e6bf525f0fcdc6f24)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Playing the Risk Horizon game was much bigger challenge that one would have thought. It was amazing how difficult it was taking that it was only focusing on a few factors. All that helped me to learn about the complexity of risk management as a whole and at some point it explained why sometimes even though the best information has been obtained we are not able to make the right decision due to certain obstacles i.e. the fact we are all biased one way or another. I was a victim of my own biases too. I live in the city that has been affected by floods each year therefore my first and main approach to the game was to make as much ground uplift as possible to protect the little community from tidal wave but not paying much attention to the other factors. Of course that was not a good strategy. <br />I think the main role of risk management in the game was the fact that creating strong community links is crucial for a post-shock recovery and cannot be ignored while we focus on gaining knowledge or obtaining the insurance. In short words: we must learn to take the holistic approach that includes the human factor like single household and the local community wellbeing alongside with new housing developments, building bams to protect certain areas from floods etc. Realising all of that has helped me to pass the level 4, as previously for some reason I pretty much ignored it focusing on buying an expensive 75% insurance coverage as soon as possible even though the probability of a severe comet impact was low. My mistake was to focus on recovery much more than on learning how to mitigate the damage at first place. <br />Second most important thing I have learned throughout playing the game was prioritising. As comets were the main issue I focused a lot on a research obtaining the cheapest insurance with a possibility for an upgrade if needed. Protection was something I have been doing along the way through each level but mainly when comets stopped appearing (i.e. ground uplifts, upgrades). I think sometimes when shocks appear one after another there is very little room for an immediate development as all the time and money focuses on repairing the damage. I think the good preparation plan based on the best knowledge we can get is a key to fast post-stress recovery and sustainable development. <br />If I could add something to the game I think perhaps I would make the game more complex while you are leveling up. I think that would help to embrace the matrix-thinking and the ability to focus on many factors all at once. As for the place where I live, I think some forward planning to mitigate the flood risk and severe weather impact on services like the local transport network would be ideal. <br />It has been a pleasure to be able to play the game. It is a nice way to use the knowledge we have gained from reading materials. </div>
