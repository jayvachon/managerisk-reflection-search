    <div class="field-value">Key Strength: The writer was able to capture in a succinct version the Risk Management Game as it relates to Preparation.

To make this reflection Better - I would probably discuss the role of Preparation in more details - Knowledge, Protection and Insurance and how these variables could be an agent of development.   Knowledge through research  helps in detecting danger (Comet), Protecting the  development (Island) by raising the Slider and adequate insurance policy provides opportunity to repair damage or recover loss. In other words, risk is inevitable as development progresses, through adequate knowledge, you could for example, check the weather forecast(through mass media) whether there would be snow on a given day and make adequate protection-wearing winter coat, driving slowly and carefully and being a heated environment thereby protecting lives. As weather conditions deteriorate, one could decide to take additional health insurance policy. These measures could safeguard lives and improve standard of living (Development).</div>
