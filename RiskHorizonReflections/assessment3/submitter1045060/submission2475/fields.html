    <h1>Submission 2475 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1045060, session_user_id: 71fd16b85a58bc259615a776648426c3aa1fce22)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">      The role of risk management in this game is to achieve optimum balance of development between calculated risk and investment.The real problem is to anticipate realistic   amount of insurance for possible devastating impact and probability for the same one.Preparation is important and gives us edge to decide whether this risk of comet  impact could be reasonably estimated or not.If i played game more than once i definitely gain momentum to better calculate level of insurance and possible investment.I would try to accommodate impact protection with probability of impact.I will put some degree of development to a new redesigned game to separately develop points of insurance on the field and maybe to create level of cost for investment, more options.<br />Regards<br /></div>
