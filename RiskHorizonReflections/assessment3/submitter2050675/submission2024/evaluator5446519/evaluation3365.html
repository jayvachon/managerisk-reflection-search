    <div class="field-value">This reflection has clearly indicated the definition and components of risk management. It also gives a very good suggestion about the new version of the game as the student designed the game by closely relating to reality.
The only shortcoming of the reflection is relative to the game itself as the student did not say much about it. If the student plays through the game, he will definitely get more and deeper understanding about the risk management reflected by the game. </div>
