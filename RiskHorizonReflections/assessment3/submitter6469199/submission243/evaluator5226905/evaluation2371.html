    <div class="field-value">There should be more focus on the game itself and how it was played. Every time there is something extra you realize/learn from your experience and you try to correct it. I would like to see what thing were done differently and in which area got more attention in comparison with the last time. Overall , I believe it was a nice reflection with remarks I also made myself.</div>
