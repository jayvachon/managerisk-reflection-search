    <h1>Submission 104 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 5875557, session_user_id: 23d6c8016860a3fede0ba9239e20a4e998da148b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I first started off by scanning through the game, trying to understand it and then, after getting a hang of it, I started playing after a bit of planning. So, here's my experience of the game:<br /><br />The game began with slow incoming comets with a low chance of hitting and level of research required was lesser. The insurance that I opted for was also of a lower value at the beginning. Then, as the game progressed, with increased difficulty i.e with a greater amount of risk, came a need for greater planning and risk management.The tools provided for risk management included all aspects such as research, insurance and protection. An adequate balance of all the three was required to achieve the desired development. That is precisely what is required in the actual scenario. A perfect balance between risk management tools - research, insurance and protection is supposed to be had for ensuring smooth and steady progress in the community or the nation as a whole. Research tells us about the magnitude and consequences of the risk, protection prepares for the oncoming risk and insurance provides the risk eliminating factor that makes sure the development or progress isn't hampered to a very large extent.It provides opportunity to take risk and reap certain benefits out of it. It covers the downside of the risk and allows for further progress.<br />Â  Therefore, the game very effectively shows that a right balance between risk management parameters and the right steps taken at the right time can help in attaining uninterrupted development and ensuring survival.</div>
