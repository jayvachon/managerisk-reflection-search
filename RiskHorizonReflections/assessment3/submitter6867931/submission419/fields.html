    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">On the first sight, it seemed that the game is pretty chilldish and simple with all this graphics, music and the story of this little planet. My first thought as that I'm going to beat it in the first try without any troubles. Oh, how wrong was I. When I couldn't pass the third stage because the green bar on the left didn't match the expected level int the allowed time, I was confused. Why did it happen? I was sure that I didn't make any mistakes. All was going so right, all the free places on the ma were covered with my pods, that I upgraded all the time. Also, on every level i bought the 75% assurance and it was clear for me, that my little planet is safe and I'm going to have a lot of money in the future, because i wasn't supposed to lose a lot of money by repairing the pods at full cost. Still, i lost. On the second try, I realized that I spent to much time on building protection, because by the time I spent my time on lifting may pods above the water level, the bar on the left became red and my virtual country was not evolving. I understood, that the same happens in every economy. If we spend to much time and money on thoughtless and exagerated risk management, our economy and society evolve at a very small rate, or maybe remain at the same place. So, the more i prepaired for risk, the less i developed my virtual country. I decided to modifiy my strategy, and it worked. First of all, i didn't spend precious time and money on builidng an escessive protection when the time for a strong one still didn't come. I directed the biggest part of mye efforts to the development of my pods, and bought the assurance only when it was necessary. The second important thing i deduced was, that there is no nedd to build a protection of a very high level, even on the 4th and 5th stage. Instead, I tried to research the comets that represented the biggest level of risk, so, when it felt in the water, i would be prepared to build as much community connections as possible. Doing this, my protection level prevaled the severity of the comets, and after that i just put a few efforts to increase my protection by one ore two levels, because it decreases automatically after the comet hits. Still, my strategy didn't allow me to pass the 5th level, because I lacked two or three seconds to rich the milestone. So, the thing I learned from the game are the next ones:<br />- is not enough to put attention only on one aspect of risk management (e.g. insurance); only using all of them can help us prevent and cope the risk, and by the same time have a fast development<br />- the potential risks appear at different times (even one after another) and we can not find a precise trend (e.g. two dangerous comet can fall one after another)<br />- community connections are very inportant in risk management<br />So, if i had the posibility to change something in this informative game, i would make it a little more difficult by adding a new aspect - the conflict of interest between the members of the community, because this kind of risk is an important one in the country where i live. I wouls introduce the conflict of interests in the moment, when you are making community connections between the pods.</div>
