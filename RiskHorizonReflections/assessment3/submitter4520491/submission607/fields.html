    <h1>Submission 607 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 4520491, session_user_id: c8707be6d1ad575bedc37f5f7ad5ee81961376b0)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The goal of this
game is development.  The role of risk
management is to protect the community pods from the damaging impacts of waves triggered
by comet impacts.  Risk management
includes helping to prepare the community by researching comets, purchasing
insurance and building protection which lifts the community beyond reach of
some waves.  Knowledge about the comets provides
time to build community linkages which enhance protection.  Reducing damage and claiming insurance helps
the community to cope by rebuilding quicker and cheaper.  This risk management helps keep development
on-track.</p>

<p>Resources are
limited.  These must first pay for
building and upgrading pods.  If you stop
building development goes off-track.  Insurance
is relatively cheap, compared to the cost of building, so purchasing a high
level of insurance (75% of rebuilding costs) seems a sensible provision.  New insurance needs to be purchased at each
level; prices depend on prior claims! 
Insurance should be purchased before further building in case a fast comet
appears.  After an impact, rebuilding should
be prioritised otherwise development stalls. </p>

<p>Research takes time
rather than resources, it helps improve understanding of possible shocks and
their potential outcomes.  Research
should be started immediately a comet appears. 
If it has low severity or probability of strike it can be ignored.  Recheck comets half-way across the sky as information
changes.  Faster comets should be checked
first.  Comets with 3+ bars on severity
and chance of hit should be researched as much as possible.  Breaks to continue building as resources
become available are worthwhile.  For a
very severe, very likely to hit comet, research should not be interrupted and
savings kept for rebuilding.  Once
research is complete, protection should be applied.  Protection helps reduce the frequency and
magnitude of damage.  Development stops when
building protection, so only apply it when development is ahead.  Protection is expensive and time consuming
but an effective way to deal with low severity comets.  Maximum protection is too expensive;
resources are needed primarily for development.</p>

<p>I played the game
many times.  Initially I build insufficient
pods to keep development on-track.  I discovered
that protection is too expensive at the start and should be saved for later when
rebuilding after minor strikes can easily disrupt development.  It was easy to miss faster and deadlier comets
by focusing on the leader.  I prefer to
build all pods to the same level before upgrading; then I know building costs.  This may make it slower to rebuild (more
clicking) but I progressed further this way. 
I learned that trade-offs are important and that choices will vary
depending on comet attributes.  There’s
often no time to restore development when a severe impact occurs immediately
before a level finishes.  Strong
development and good preparation help, but sometimes you’re unlucky.  </p>

<p>I also learned the
game runs significantly slower in Chrome than Firefox!  I was stuck at level 3 in Chrome but advanced
to level 5 immediately in Firefox; protection and community linking ran at
least 50% faster.  I suggest this means  we should always explore our options as the
underlying causes of success and failure may not be what we expected!</p>

<p>I would add variable
terrain to this game.  Buildings further
inland and/or raised would suffer less damage after impacts.  This introduces a new element of positioning
to the game and better reflects local variability of risk.  I live by a tidal river but my building is
built on a raised concrete platform and has an under-garage, hence it’s more
protected than many of the neighbours.</p></div>
