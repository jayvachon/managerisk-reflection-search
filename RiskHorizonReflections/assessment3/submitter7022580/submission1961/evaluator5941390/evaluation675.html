    <div class="field-value">The author seems to have a decent understanding of the purpose of the game and about the obstacles of development and risks that may occur. It is appreciated how the author's point of view on the game is elaborated and how the author describes the steps he had to undertake to reach to advance in the game. Unfortunately, there is no comment on future upgrade of the game and I also did not find out what would the author do differently or what he did differently when playing for second/third time. Overall impression of the next is good, though.</div>
