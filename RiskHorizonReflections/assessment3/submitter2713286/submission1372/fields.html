    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span><em>What was the role of risk management in the game? What choices did you make and what trade-offs did you confront in terms of knowledge, protection, and insurance? In what ways did preparation for risk affect development (immediately, or after some time)?</em><br /><br /></span>This weeks course required a consideration of knowledge, protection, insurance, and coping. Like most games, I played Risk Horizon without reading the instructions which in hindsight taught me more than probably was required. First few tries, having little knowledge, I built widely and without insurance soon watched my efforts fail. Each attempt I added more insurance or spent more time researching, and failed to build enough protection into design.  Once I could see risk versus reward for various designs, I could get to level 4 and almost succeeded to level 5 but for an extreme event.  I build uniformly and bought insurance as late as possible. I upgraded design over 5 of the 8 spots .<br /><br /><em>If you played the game only once, what would you do differently if you were to play it again? Alternatively, if you played the game more than once, what did you do differently after the first time? What were the main things you learned from the game?</em><br /><br />Prediction from better design and insurance does allow greater risk taking, extreme events can challenge survival. Improving design over time becomes more costly to repair. Failing to repair also effects wealth creation.  In some cases, I waited until income allowed buying a higher cover.<br /><br />I live in Melbourne and design of our cities has emerged over 200 years. Some old infrastructure would not cope with an event, and like the game, newer designs are increasingly more robust. While the game had predictable insurance outcomes, events of scale have resulted in insurance payouts being queried. The game was more uniform and allowed time to respond whereas coping in the real world can be more stressful.<br /><br /><em>The game captures, in a simplified way, some aspects of risk management. Imagine you are tasked with developing a new version of the game, which allows you to change or add one simple thing. What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live?</em><br /><br /><span>The game had one event type up to level 4 and on repetition, protection, insurance and coping had known outcomes. Systemic risk though can include unforeseen or previous low level risk categories that have changed in scale . The asteroid hit was foreseen and gave immediate results. Common cause variation occurs in systems. Special cause variation though is rare, and unpredictable . I kept thinking the game might include an event I could not foresee, had overlooked or would not be worth the cost of </span> in protection or insurance . <br /><br />With each level, insurance and building costs grew incrementally, and made it harder to maintain all property to the same level. In a community, some might feel hard done by if they see progress at the neighbours, and yet not at their place after an event. It was easier to fix the cheaper levels first, but these would not survive a large event later in the game. Working on the more expensive areas, though,while being a better option may be a tough sell politically.<br /><br />The game had no requirement for empathy, and the economic equation fails to adequately recognise social and environmental concern. The greatest insight from the game is that decision makers have lives, property and environment to protect and assist in recovery. While the game had specific benchmarks, in real life, indicators are not constantly visible, nor are remedies. </div>
