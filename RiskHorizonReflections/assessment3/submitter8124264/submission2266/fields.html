    <h1>Submission 2266 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8124264, session_user_id: 461c82e8e6b382b641fb7c0c12c6f532bb268d34)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><span>1.    
</span>In this game,
risk management is composed of four essential parts, such as spending time and
some capital in research (acting as knowledge), raising the level of land
(acting as protection), buying and renewing insurance policy (acting as
insurance), making quick community connections after the hit of comets (acting
as effective copping). The good preparation and effective copping not only significantly
reduces the damage caused by the comets, but also boost a stable and sustainable
development of the community. 

<p><span>In
my trials of the games, I tended to balance my resources (time and money) among
knowledge, protection, and insurance. Knowledge is a main consumer of time and
relatively small consumer of money; protection not only has large financial
costs, but also
takes some amount of time to build up; renewing insurance does not take time,
but does have financial costs. Eg., making community
connection is equivalent to raising maximum 3 bars, so we don’t need to spend marginally expensive
dollars on raising the land  after we have reached reasonable protection, on the other, it tells  the upper limit of copping, so I can not
fully rely on researching and making quick community connections, but have to
keep the protection always at proper level, being aware that I can raise another
3 bars, and if anything happens
beyond my expectations, insurance can play out as the last resort. I like to buy the 33% insurance, because, in terms of
the ratio of the coverage and cost, 33% package yields the best. </span>

</p><p> <span>Preparation
for risk may seem to impede development immediately,  since they cost money, which otherwise can be
used to invest into Pod upgrades, and it costs time. But in the long run, it
actually help to accelerate the development, which would otherwise be pushed
backward significantly with the hit of comets, especially at more advanced
stages, when the comets are more frequent and the damage is more severe. </span>

</p><p> <span><br /></span></p><p><span>2.    
</span>In my first play,
I didn’t spend time in research, which became my bottleneck as I did
not have enough money to constantly keep my protection bar at high
level to shield from external shocks. Besides, I lefts a few
lands deserted rather than developed, this seems problematic later
on, as too few pods would not generate enough money to develop further and manage risk. 

</p><p> The main
things I learned were 

</p><p><span>1)   
</span><span>Acquiring both
general knowledge and specific knowledge about a particular comet help us to make better decision on resource
allocations and more effective copping after the negative outcome happens. </span></p>

<p><span>2)   
</span>Protection and
insurance well balance each other, act as another two pillars in risk
management. </p>

<p><span>3)   
</span>Effective copping
(making quick community connections) not only requires a fast action after the
disaster happens, but also well preparedness (such as research)</p>



<p><span><br /></span></p><p><span>3.    
</span><span>I would make two
changes if I were allowed to.  </span></p>

<p> I would make
research more costly. The currently research seems to be a main consumer of
time, but not money. I would think in real life, research (not only limited in
science and technology) requires significant amount of financial inputs, and in
most cases, the more negative impacts the comets potentially have, the more
research resources it needs. 

</p><p> <span>I would make
the timing of the comets less predictable. In real life, the timing of risk is
unknown in many cases, such as terrorist attacks, tsunami, and earthquake. The
current setup has all the comets attack time being known, and make us easier to
get prepared  (than what happens in real
life.)</span>
