    <div class="field-value">Your reflection is clear and brief on the tradeoff between knowledge, protection and insurance (plus building activities). You also added interesting ideas how the could be improved.
What I missed in your reflection is an evaluation of learning experience about this tradeoff: the pros and cons of investing in protection, research or insurance. You could chose to spend resources on increasing protection in 'good times', or spend all these resources on building. Meanwhile you had to chose between spending your time on holding the protection key (right below) or on researching the asteroid approaching. Remember, this research could give you the opportunity to have more time (after impact of an asteroid) to create 'connections' which also increased your protection / minimizing the damage of impact (just for that impact once). Your reflection did not make clear what your strategy was to that tradeoff.</div>
