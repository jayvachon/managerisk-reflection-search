    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game shows how the risk management is
important to prevent the future acting in the present. The actions are aligned.
Correct actions represent the same of save money.</p>



<p>1 The role is to attend the necessity to cover the
buildings and the capacity of cash to contract. How you can improve your
reserve, get the best insurance and upgrade the buildings.</p>



<p>I done more than one try. The last I understand
that I have to create more buildings with different level of resources. The
insurance was a problem because just in the first level that I got the best
one.</p>



<p>2 The first time, I just looked for the resources
level of the buildings and the capital to cover the necessities. So my problem
was that I just look to the real time and not do the correct planning for the
future.</p>



<p>3 To up the city: for me will be
better if you can determined a level for your city, so that can do
automatically when you have enough money.</p>
