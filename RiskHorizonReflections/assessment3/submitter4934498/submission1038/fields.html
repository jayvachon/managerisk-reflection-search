    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Repair Costs and Risks are two sides of coin. One need to make decision of only one at a time. Repair costs can help the infrastructure/product to withstand risk either by no damage or by some less amount of repair cost.
