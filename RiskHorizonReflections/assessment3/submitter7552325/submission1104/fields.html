    <h1>Submission 1104 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7552325, session_user_id: 6a56a71c0467e7f23ee4f5458d36794792fabcd8)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The essence of the game was to guage the incoming risks and device an appropriate strategy to counter it. The strategy had to be the best possible mix of resources allocated towards Development, information gathering and Insurance.<br />The impending risks made me invest heavily on the insurance cover, which helped me to recoup my loses much faster. I was able to devote more resource towards core development.<br />My strategy was to keep the development going, simultaneously devoting resources towards getting the knowledge about the risk. With this I could gauge the severity/possibility of the impact and accordingly go for the strategies namely insurance or direct risk counter.<br />During the first couple of times, I couldn't predict the benefit an insurance cover provided to my development. I understood it after a couple of rounds. It gives better recovery from unforeseen risks and should be used judiciously.<br />Some features I would have wanted to see was a interlinked development of the buildings. They were independent. Also a better indicator of the task to be accomplished. It wasn't very self explanatory.<br />The element of Community coming together to mitigate a risk was not present in the simulation game.<br /></div>
