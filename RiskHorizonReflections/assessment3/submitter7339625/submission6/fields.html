    <h1>Submission 6 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7339625, session_user_id: b043adb78d9eeff3ad0304c66fae861951170070)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>1.         Risk
management played a big role in the game: the elements of knowledge, protection
and insurance were all crucial. When I played the game, I chose to do
research to gain <b>knowledge</b> about
each comet on the horizon: if the ‘chance of hit’ and ‘severity’ were both low,
I would disregard the comet, and I would not use resources to buy insurance or
increase protection (raising the island). However, if the ‘chance of hit’
and ‘severity’ were both high, I would buy <b>insurance</b>
that would provide 75% coverage, in order to minimize losses after a probable
hit. I would also spend time and money on <b>protection </b>to reduce the level of damage to the pods. I confronted some
trade-offs: if I spent more time on research to get more accurate knowledge
about a comet, I did not have as much time to use resources to raise the island
for protection, or to build/upgrade pods for development. Likewise, due to
limited resources, I sometimes had to decide whether to build/upgrade pods,
raise the island, or buy insurance, as I did not have enough resources to do
everything. Risk preparation slightly hindered development in the short term because I had less resources for development, but preparation aided development in the longer term, as I was better protected and/or insured against damages that would significantly hinder development.</p>

<p>2.         The first time
I played the game, I forgot to protect the island or buy insurance because I was too focused on
development (building/upgrading pods) that I neglected risk management. As a result,
the damage caused by a comet was so great that I lost on that level. The next
time I played, I made sure to buy insurance on each level if I believed that
there was a high risk of a severe comet hitting. After playing a few times, I discovered that protection (raising the island) was a better game strategy than buying insurance, because undamaged pods contribute more to development than damaged pods. The main things I learned from
the game is that risk management contains different elements (learning about a
risk, protecting against the risk, and insuring the risk), and I learned that risk
management is a balancing act, as a person’s resources are limited. I also learned that protecting against a risk is better than only buying insurance for potential losses.</p>

<p>3.         A change I
would propose is to add more risks to the game. There are the risks of flooding,
contagious diseases, and financial crises in the place I live. There are several risk management choices that matter here, such as deciding where to live (living on a hill means that flooding is less likely but it's more expensive).</p></div>
