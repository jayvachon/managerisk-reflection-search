    <h1>Submission 2406 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8372650, session_user_id: 078c4da68fe68e683b09c63adc71458f1f5470bb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The risk horizon game had multiple</p><p> </p><p>With each comet that was launched, I had to balance between
the severity (keeping in mind that I would be paying the repair costs) as well
as how much research we had on the severity/likelihood of strike. I did not
find the research metric to be very valuable, since there was rarely data
there. </p><p> </p><p>With the insurance policies, it seemed like the premiums
that I paid should fluctuate in conjunction with how many homes there are and
how developed they were, but that was instead based on level. </p><p> </p><p>I wish in the game that the balance was made clearer to us
up front between what would generate more productivity: more a smaller number
of highly upgraded homes or a larger number of less upgraded communities. I
understood that there was an element of value from the communities chatting
with one another, but I wasn’t given much of a logical basis to quantify it.</p><p> </p><p>The higher the level of insurance, the better I did on early
levels. In the time I advanced the farthest and did the best in Level 3
(although I did still lose), I  Learned
about the value in research. Still not sure what to do with delay.Valley in
community interactions for disseminating information. Makes risk management
easier. I’m not sure I saw the value in what the delay did in the context of
the game however.</p><p> </p><p>






































</p><p>I also worked to optimize the decision of when to buy
insurance, since money has a time value that is especially pertinent in that
game. </p></div>
