    <h1>Submission 982 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1864758, session_user_id: c81c1359b46e12d8bed5d68f557158434655763c)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">1.<br />The game was about developing an island under the risk of falling comets which could cause damage to the development. There were 3 options for risk management in the game - insurance, protection and knowledge.<br />The most simple and obvious was insurance - by buying an insurance developer could reduce cost of damage repairs (insurance company would cover part of it). At the same time insurance didn't reduce damage - which was expected.<br />Second option was protection. The way to protect the island was to raise its level above the see so waves caused by falling comets would not damage the development.<br />And the last one - knowledge. By observing the comet the developer could get better idea about severity of potential damage, and could better prepare beforehand - by raising island level, or by buying insurance - and also have more time to prepare for coming waves when hit occurred.<br /><br />As all 3 options cost money and that money had to be taken from development funds trade-offs were necessary - either to spend money on development or on risk management. If no money was spent on risk management damages were so severe that they heavily hindered the development and game was lost. The same result - game loss - happened when too much money was spent on risk management - in this case pace of development was affected so it was not fast enough to succeed in the game (pace of development was affected immediately).<br /><br />2.<br />Initially I had only read game rules and didn't go through the tutorial, and couldn't get beyond second level of the game as a result - I didn't know some important rules and features, and couldn't develop optimal strategy (game rules description is incomplete and only tutorial provides adequate coverage). Then - after going through the tutorial - I learned that upgrades were considered more beneficial than construction of foundation of the building. I started focusing on upgrades instead of trying to build the island level by level. That brought my development pace to the required level and I managed to get up to level 6 in one go. Another thing which improved my result was awareness of severity level of the comet. Knowing that I could consciously prepare better for shock - by either raising protection to required extent, or by buying insurance when protection was not sufficient.<br /><br />3.<br />One obvious improvement would be to have clear statement that game rules description is incomplete, and going through the tutorial is a must to learn the rules. Another confusion was about what actions were needed after comet hit - I found those buildings randomly going green and black confusing (as was description of this part in the tutorial as well). I think the game would look more natural if preparation activity before waves hit the island was painted more clearly (and waves themselves could be shown as well).<br /><br /></div>
