    <div class="field-value">Strength: The author of the reflection answered all the questions. 
                The recommendation (question 3) was interesting.

The only thing that would make this reflection better is the structure of certain sentences. For example: «The choices I made were as follows. Of course, the goal is for your town to grow enough to reach the threshold.» Other than that, it was a good reflection!</div>
