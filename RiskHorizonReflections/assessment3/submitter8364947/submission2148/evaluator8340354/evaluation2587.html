    <div class="field-value">I liked the way this reflection is structured. It's clear, comprehensive and well-written. The role of Risk management is clearly defined and used bease on description of the student's game activity. 
There is nothing I can think about to make thisreflection better. It's good for understanding, well-structured and reflects main points that were required. Good job! I wish to write as well!!!</div>
