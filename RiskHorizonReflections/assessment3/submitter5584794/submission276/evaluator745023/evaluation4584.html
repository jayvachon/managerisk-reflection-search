    <div class="field-value">This reflection captures very well the experience of role-playing a risk manager. The trade-offs and synergies between knowledge, protection and insurance, and how you altered their contribution as you played additional rounds in managing the risk are well emphasized. The suggested addition to the game is well-thought. An element that could added is the time dimension of decisions (e.g., development, protection and coping take certain time to materialize).</div>
