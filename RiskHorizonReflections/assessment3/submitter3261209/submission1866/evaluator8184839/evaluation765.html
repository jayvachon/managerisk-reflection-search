    <div class="field-value">In total the essay is to short to tick all required boxes. What has been written is hard to understand due to spelling and grammar errors. As I am a non-native speaker myself it got the important points across. Student should enhance in explaining more into detail what he has learned from the game. This will enhance the understanding of the text and reflection.</div>
