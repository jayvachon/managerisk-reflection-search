    <div class="field-value">In my opinion the key strength of this reflection was that the person came to understand that risks need to be prioritized and that thorough research is vital.
What would have made this reflection better would have been not just what was learnt but how the learnt knowledge could be applied to the principles of risk management and what opportunities can result in from good risk management.</div>
