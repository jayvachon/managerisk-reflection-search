    <div class="field-value">I think the key strenght of the reflection is when it' said that was changed the method to building as much as pods as it could in the begining. In this way, when one doesn't have the insentives and resources from governament and private sector, he will have the help from the community (informal insurance).
And for making this reflection better I wouldn't invest much in protection, because in some way it hinder development and time; this allow people to not focus on developing their life and give them a false sence of security in my opinion.</div>
