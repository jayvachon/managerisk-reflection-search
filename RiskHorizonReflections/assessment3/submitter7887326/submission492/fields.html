    <h1>Submission 492 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7887326, session_user_id: 1e38aa2c8dc84eedf653bd9fcbd24f827e0a0938)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk Management in the game was necessary to make sure you could make your investments and protect them from disaster. There was no way to be successful if you only tried to manage risk with one method, or only invested in pods, it took various combinations to be successful. I was able to see how preparation before an event is very important, but the coping with the event after the fact and making good decisions was just as important. Timing is everything. I found it much easier to do well in the game if you did not have to rely on the insurance, but instead invest more upfront and make sure you had cash reserves, that way you didn't get stuck waiting for your investments to start making you money again. I played the game multiple times and noticed that you had to balance your time and money to be successful, this is quite similar to real life. You must make trade offs and choices, sometimes you won't know until after the fact if it was the right thing to do.Â  Sometimes I purchased insurance and then did not need it, but the downside to not having insurance and needing it made me fail the first time I played. If I were helping to develop a new version of the game, I would make the costs of various choices more transparent. It's hard to see how much you are spending on various risk management features, should you upgrade or build more pods, which have a higher return? Should I buy the insurance or build up the island? Over all I like the simplicity of the module, made it easy to use and implements the ideas of balancing risk and reward quite nicely.</div>
