    <div class="field-value">What i have liked the most about this game reflection is how the student is describing his or her thoughts while playing and  discovering the game. It shows the reflection of the student behind the game. 
In my opinion the student have ignored some questions, for instance: the role of risk management in this game and imagining a new version of the game to adopt it in your community were not answered. To make this refection better, i think the student should write less about his game experience and try to answer the missing questions.</div>
