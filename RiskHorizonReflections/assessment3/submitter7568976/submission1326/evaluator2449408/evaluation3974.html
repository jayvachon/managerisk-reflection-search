    <div class="field-value">I liked the way have expressed the whole experience you had while  playing a game. The last paragraph is something you might have to look upon. The main objective of this game was to deal with the situation which can be irregular and uncertain (Real life disaster). The challenge here was to manage in the very less time that was provided. When the disaster comes, it doesn't wait for anyone, it just happens. Also, there are disasters which just can't be prevented (Like your idea of shooting down the comets). It will make your life easy, but you won't be challenged. This will completely omit the essence of this game. If this is possible, people will only invest on shooting out the comets because that's what is creating problems. The idea was to optimize resources in insurance, knowledge and Up gradation. Hope this answers everything. 

Overall, I liked it.   </div>
