    <div class="field-value">The key strength of the reflection is how my peer has been abel to theorize the concepts tested in the game.  She/he highlights the tough trade-offs that risk manager has to take to succeed, especially in context of the simulation.

That said, I find the reflection to be lacking in detail.  It doesn't present me with my peer's approach in the game.  Answers to following questions would make this reflection better:
1. How many times did she/he play?  It appears multiple times but it would have been great to know what strategy changes were made from one attempt to another.
2. What is the highest level she/he reach?  
3. What part of the risk management conundrum did the student find most challenging?</div>
