    <h1>Submission 1031 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7542317, session_user_id: c81a648a3156333d1250a6dbb3933820f6d2ffd9)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>The role of risk management in the game was
the central strategy to win. There were clear trade-offs to make between
development, knowledge of risks (comets), protection, and insurance. The more
time spent in knowledge, the less time possible was to spend in development. On
the other hand, the monetary trade-off was between development and preparation
for risk, that is protection and insurance. 
The more money spent in protection or insurance, the less money or resources
for development available and this has relation to reality as such is the case
in all industries, there are limited resources and they have to be invested in
those instruments that provide the higher return, in other words, we wish we
had everything but we have to do the best with what we have.</span></p>

<p>I played the game two times, the first time
I made it to level 5 but I noticed that a comet of high severity set me back in
the development and I fell short of the development requirement by the
deadline. So I thought that perhaps I invested too much in protection and I
should’ve put that money into insurance since the comet was category 9 and it
was going to hit us for sure and create damage no matter the level of protection. When I played the second time I
had a similar output, I reached level 5 and again ran out of time to get to the
development requirement. I learned that there is a fine balance between
protection and insurance and it has to be addressed on a one to one basis as
the conditions in the second time were different from the first one.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the game is great, I liked
the interface and also the way it captures the principles of risk management in
an engaging way. If I had to add something I think it would be the part where
we have to make connections with other communities after a comet impacts the
planet. I thought that was a little cumbersome clicking in the bright spots as
some are still bright but once you click on them they become deactivated. I am
thinking that maybe they should become another colour like purple or something
like that to make it obvious you clicked on the already. Another thing I would
add is also colour to the different levels of development in the pods, at some
point in advanced levels it become overcrowded and a little bit difficult to
see which ones need to be upgraded.</p><p><br /></p>
