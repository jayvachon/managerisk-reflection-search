    <h1>Submission 2495 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 182142, session_user_id: 8e2a74d0cb8104dddfc3a25bd77e677e4b215f82)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p><span>I think the
role of risk management in the game basically was allowing us to avoid risk and
pursue opportunities, as mentioned repeatedly in the course. I must admit it
wasn’t that easy for me. But once I figured out how to prepare for
comets and how to cope with the situation once the Alora gets hit, I was able
to develop and upgrade my pods more safely, I mean at least without trembling
for a catastrophic hit. I think the most fundamental choice, trade-off that one
had to face in every second was between taking an action for development i.e.
building a new pod, upgrading or for avoiding risk i.e. increasing long-run resilience,
buying insurance, observing the hits for clear information. And in this respect,
the color of the development meter that indicates whether I will manage to
reach the target in given time was one of the elements that I used for
guidance.  If the meter is yellow-like or
worse and I feel that I’m moderately safe, I focused more on building and upgrading
my pods while relying heavily on research, keeping an eye constantly for the closest
comets. If it’s green-like or better, I made investment for long-term
protection. If there is an emergency and a catastrophic damage is at hand and I’m
not adequately resilient, I took insurance, or extended its coverage for
recovery. That helped really much for the compensation. Otherwise, the repairment
expenses became overwhelming and I failed to reach even the pre-disaster
conditions given the limited time that I had. Since I opted for an extended
insurance as a last chance, compared to protection and research that I mostly preferred,
also more affordable when applied effectively, the benefits of insurance was also
immediate, similar to research in this sense. Observing and gathering
information provided immediate advantages in terms of reducing uncertainty,
releasing the tension about what is the best to do next. The benefits of
protection were rather remote, but most effective I would say. I played the
game more than once, actually many times. The thing I learned about research is
that it is not enough just to click once on the comet and rely on the first
impression. That frequently led to underestimation of the potential damage, and
also misleading results for chance of hit and severity. About the long-term
protection, I learned that there was an average level of protection that has to
be maintained, given such a habitat. It was also better not to make a big payment
just before an approaching hit. It is quite possible that you will crave for cash when the repairment is necessary. In summary, the main thing that I learned is
how to keep the tension between the development and measures to avoid risk at
balance.. </span></p></div>
