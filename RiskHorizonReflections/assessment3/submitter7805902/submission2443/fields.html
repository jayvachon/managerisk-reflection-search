    <h1>Submission 2443 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7805902, session_user_id: c06420034be1adf85a6d709a3fcee97d84ec8c3b)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game captures all the facets of risk management – knowledge,
protection, insurance and then coping after the event of a shock. To be able to
develop the community effectively, one has to adequately balance all parts of
risk management, bearing in mind the constraints of time and resources.</p>

<p>For instance, purchasing expensive, but high coverage
insurance would mean low payout on repairs after a shock but would also imply
that there would be fewer resources available for developing pods which would
in turn impede development. Also, raising the community to protect it against
shocks consumes resources that could otherwise be available for growth and temporarily
brings development to a halt. These are trade-offs that one has to manage
effectively in the bid to achieve growth.</p>

<p>After playing the game a couple of times, I was able to
learn the importance of insurance. Initially, I would purchase a low level of
insurance, if at all, and focus more on protecting the community and researching
the comets. I believed that would help in avoiding the shocks in the first
place and not having to be faced with the challenges of coping with them. Eventually,
I learnt the importance of insurance and had to incorporate it into my game
plan. There are unavoidable events in real life that despite adequate
preparations and measures taken to avert crisis, they still do occur. That is when
insurance comes in handy.</p>

<p>If tasked with the responsibility of developing a new
version of the game, I would ease the time constraints a bit. There were a
couple of times that the development of the community had surpassed the mark required
to proceed to the next level of civilization, but would experience a major shock
that would make the community regress. Often times, the community would not
recover from the shock before time runs out. I believe in real life situations,
development is not based on a strict time limit. Countries and communities
advanced on their own time. A good example is Brazil that is making efforts to
become a world power and would not have to wait till 2050, for instance, to be
declared one. When it is adjudged to have reached that status, it is addressed
as a world power.  So in my version of
the game, the player would be allowed to proceed to the next level of
development as soon as he/she surpasses the required level. This would ensure
he/she is not subjected to a shock that would undermine all his/her efforts and
make him/her lose the game.</p>

<p>I am sure that calls for the argument that economic growth
should be seen to be sustainable before a new status is declared. In that case,
once the bar is surpassed, a new time limit ought to be set to test the sustainability
of the growth the community has achieved. In the game, some comets struck just
a few seconds to time which was not enough for it to recover before the game was
declared over.</p>

<p>In conclusion, it is a well-developed game that tasks the
mental capacity of the player concerning the principles of risk management. I
was able to reinforce some of the lessons learnt so far during the course of
the program. </p></div>
