    <div class="field-value">400 to 600 words were expected and needed to complete the assignment. The game has been tried and some learning acquired and shared. Unfortunately the 3 concepts (knowledge, protection, insurance) have not been addressed in the essay. There is a good start of reflection. Excellent detailed would have been provided if confusion in reading the assignment didn't exist. Expectation was to provide information on how you did/would apply your learning for the subsequent game trials (acquire insurance early, develop further pods or privilege pods upgrade, invest more/less in research ...) </div>
