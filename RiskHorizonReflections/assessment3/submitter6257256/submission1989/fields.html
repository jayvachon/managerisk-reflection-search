    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">               The role of risk management in this game was to healthfully develop ( by balancing between preparing for risk and investing in building and upgrading Pods) the Alora community to the best of our ability while meeting certain milestones along the way. We had choices to buy insurance, protection, build new pods or upgrade the already built over a wealth constraint (amount of money we instantaneously  get in our account) while keeping an eye on the comets which are the source of the risk coming up. <span> looking out into space and learning the chance of the comet hitting, the time until impact, and the severity of the comet, it's then possible to make a good strategy to face with waves when they will occur after the comet hits. we need so to spend our money to get prepare so that our development process should not be affected. our goal is not only to build a lot of Pods but also to make sure they are secure. that's why according to the information get from researches we decide to buy protection and / or  insurance before the comet hits. protection will prevent our Pods from damages while insurance will help our damaged Pods to quicker and cheaper to rebuild. the thing we made was to give priority to protection by investing in more than in insurance. even though we have a good level of protection when severity of an up coming shock is high, it should be useful to buy insurance in order to rebuild the probably damaged pods in a quick an cheap way. the last mean to be protected when comet hits is to build community connections even though its less efficient than other means it can also help to limit damage.it can be easily observed that preparation for the risk affects development immediately or after some time. protection and making community connections affects development immediately because because it prevents damaged and insurance affects development after some time necessary to rebuild damaged Pods.<br />               I played the game more than once so what I did after the first one was to notice that the more you build pods more you become vulnerable if the risk occurs. therefore I learnt is that  the development is but the sustainable development is better. that's after playing some games my goal was to take into account not only development but also all the tools (protection, insurance and community connections) which can help me to manage risks when they occurs in order to reach a sustainable development. also after a certain number of games I have learned that buy protection is better than getting an insurance. because obviously they affect development in the different ways. protection is immediately while insurance affects development after some time. İn addition I have learnt that managing risk requires a lot of knowledge on the risk subject (phenomenons) and also needs to take into account several parameters. having experiences in the field can also help to manage risk effectively. managing risk is not the mathematical relation 1+1=2. therefore what we have to do is to use all the information we get in hands to reduce at the minimum level damages. its not impossible to hedge all the risk but its an ideal to get this situation and any serious risk manager should pursue this goal.<br />                If I were tasked with developing a new version of this game I should probably add to take into account the experience (shown by the memory effect) in the managing process. which should be represent by the number of the game you play independently.<br /></span><span><br /></span></div>
