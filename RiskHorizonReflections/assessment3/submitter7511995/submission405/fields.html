    <h1>Submission 405 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7511995, session_user_id: bd5172e4c7b142f68ff8a235945831d63d37ef95)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Firstly, in the game, the role of risk management is very
important. It decides the development of community, and how quickly a community
recovers after a disaster. </p>

<p>Specifically, in the game, I had to make choices to decide
which one I should invest money on: the development of the village (build and
upgrade more houses) or I should spend that money and time on the knowledge,
protection and insurance. If I build and upgrade more houses, I will have to
wait until the wealth is enough to do other things such as buying a package of
insurance and raising the land higher, which means the investment on these
things will be lower compared to when I spend all of money  on these and neglecting the houses. Although
the preparation for risk affects the development, it is just a matter of
short-term view. It is true that the development will be stopped at the moment
to leave the side for the protection, getting knowledge and insurance as the
result of the opportunity cost; but it does not mean that the development will
be ignored forever. All the protection plans and insurance are the way to make
sure that the development of your community can last as long as it is possible.
Remember that only a good preparation plan will assist the security so that
people can feel safe to work and develop. </p>

<p>Moreover, I concluded this after I had played the game three
times: I spent more time to do research on the comets and I became more aware
of the sky, even though the sky was clear and lack of comets, when I was
focusing on building the village. Also, I tried to buy a full package of
insurance though it was expensive as if something takes place, I got more than
what I paid. One thing I learn most in this game is that an accident/disaster
can happen any time and the severity can be different from the lightest to the
toughest. I should always have some backup plans before and after the bad
things happening to me. </p>

<p>Finally, if I have a chance to add one thing in the game, I
may want to add the cost to the research on comets. I realize that when you
researched the comets, it didn’t cost anything except for the time. In fact, it
should have cost something, not much but we do need money to do a research in
real life and this will emphasize the trade-off between the development and
getting knowledge, protection and insurance. Furthermore, in Vietnam where I
come from, the importance of insurance is being neglected. People rather keep
their money than using it to buy insurance. It mostly roots from the lack of
knowledge about the severity when something bad takes place. It is not about
the money because even when they have money, they still don’t want to spend it
on the insurance. There should be program to educate people, to make them
realize that they definitely will spend more when an accident happens to them
and/or the government can loan/support the families who cannot afford the insurance,
especially farmers. In the end, the neglected habit and lack of information are
main features of poverty and slow development. </p>
