    <div class="field-value">The key strength of this reflection is the ability of the student to articulate in his/her own simple words exactly what was required to successfully protect Almora.
This reflection covers very vague concepts of risk management. How the student went about protecting the city of Almora was not clear. Could have been better.</div>
