    <div class="field-value">The reflection was in overall fair to middling. You somehow explained what knowledge the game provided. But, you put off almost half of your words in explaining what you did in the essay which you shouldn't have done. Rather you should have provided an outline of what you did and explained what it helped you to know regarding risk management.
You should have explained the trade-offs that you faced while taking the decision on development and preparation. Also, you should have added how the game helped to broaden you horizon for risk management.
