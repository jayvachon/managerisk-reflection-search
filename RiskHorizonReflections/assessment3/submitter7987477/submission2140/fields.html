    <h1>Submission 2140 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7987477, session_user_id: 05fd22efd5dadbc92529c483c1465a2ad5dc1e09)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">I think this is a great game with lots of trade-offs being used. When I started playing this game I won't go beyond level 1 even in 5 attempts. I was investing in protection &amp; insurance,heavily, but nothing in up-gradation (or knowledge). So,in subsequent attempts, I started setting up huge number of Pods without much needed up-gradation. Again,I'm struck at level 2. I tried setting up half a number of pots with continuous up-gradation without much needed protection (or research). That too didn't help me much in going beyond level 2. Slowly-2,I realized I need to build small number of Pods(2-4) upgrade them on continuous basis, keep insurance proprtionate to the value of Pods and keep increasing the protection. No compromise with that one!<br />At level 1,I built 3 pods,upgraded them,bought the cheapest insurance &amp; invested pretty good on protection. By the time level 2 appeared, I had 3 level 3 pods and one level 2 pod with middle range of insurance,I invested,heavily, on insurance at this stage. I learnt to keep protection according to the upcoming comets. At level 3,I had 4 level 4 pods,mild value insurance &amp; 8-point protection. I couldn't cross level 4. <br />If I am to play again I'll use lesser number of pods at beginning &amp; increase one with every level.<br />There were so many trade-offs in the game. Between knowledge-protection, protection-insurance, insurance-knowledge,&amp; all of them together. What I learnt from the game is we need to keep basic resources at first,insuring them at little value while increasing the protection &amp; up-gradation side-by-side. Protection,clearly, reduces the need for Insurance but doesn't replaces it at all.<br />So,all the three components are must.<br />If I am to suggest something? I'll say,umm, I'm from India. Here, population is huge &amp; resources are,undoubtedly, a few. People create SHGs(Self Help Group) to mitigate their sufferings which work on the principle of subsidiarity. So,in the game when government bought the insursnce &amp; set-up different pods. I'd like if insurance takes its contribution from pods rather than lump-sum. That'd be all,folks! Thank you for reading!<br /></div>
