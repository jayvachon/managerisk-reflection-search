    <div class="field-value">Good day,
To my mind - the key strength of your reflection is example with farmer. It shows your knowledge and understanding of basic concepts, and it's also linked(in comparison) with game rules and game situation.
And there is one thing that(i suppose) would make your reflection even more better - please, try to bring more structure in your reasoning. Something like "introduction, main part, conclusion" - it will make your reflection more presentable.
Anyway, you got the highest assessment from me. You done it well!
Thank you for your attention,
Sincerely, Michael</div>
