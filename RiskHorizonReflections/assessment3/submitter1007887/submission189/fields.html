    <h1>Submission 189 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 1007887, session_user_id: 427eb961e37a571a6ebd755afdbe705852a5811a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">The role of risk management in this game was to effectively block, or minimize, the risk and damage of comets striking the planet. In order to gain knowledge for risk management, I could click on the comets and see information about the comet, such as severity of damage or chance of strike. For protection, I could increase the protection level of the planet. For insurance, I could buy one of the insurance choices. All of these measures, however, had a trade-off of payment: I had to pay money to gain knowledge, protection, and insurance, which could hinder my ability to reach the target wealth for the level. Moreover, the higher the level of protection or the insurance was, the more expensive were their costs.<p>
The preparation for risk was well worth paying for. The rather high sum of money I paid for a higher level of protection resulted in rarely getting any damage at all for my planet. Because the protection covered potential damage, I could focus more on development without worrying about the comet strikes in the long run. Moreover, the one time that I did get some damage by the comets, half of it was paid by the insurance, which had immediate benefits.</p><p>
If I were to play the game again, I would pay more for higher protection and instead buy a smaller insurance package. On most levels I chose to buy the 50% insurance package, but I realized that if the protection level is high enough to counter the potential damage, I don’t need the insurance. Hence, in the future I will rather buy the 33% insurance package and pay more for a higher level of protection.</p><p>
The main point I learned from the game was the balance between development and risk preparation and how it can often be a fine line. I thought that having a high level of risk preparation would be the best in the long term, since that would significantly reduce the damage. However, in the level I failed, I failed because I had “over-prepared” for risk. For instance, I focused too much on matching the protection level with the severity level of a comet, not realizing that the development bar was going red. As a result, I was able to prevent damage from that comet but had spent too much money to achieve the necessary rate of development.</p><p>
If I were to change one feature in the game, I would add a long-term or gradual risk in addition to the short-term risk of comet strikes. Specifically, I would add the risk of pollution. A possible design would be: an upgraded pod would cause a small amount of cost over a period of time, such as every 45 seconds, and the more upgraded the pod, the higher the cost would be. There can be a feature like “buy air filter”, similar to the “buy insurance” feature, to counter this cost. Through this additional feature, the player would ideally learn that a long-term cost, which may be negligible in the beginning, can add up to a significant cost after a while. The player would also be able to learn that there are side effects to development as well. This additional feature better reflects the situation of South Korea, the country I live, where the majority of risk in Korea is the result of development such as pollution and waste disposal.
