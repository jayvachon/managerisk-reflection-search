    <h1>Submission 2193 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 7803025, session_user_id: 67b8b1e5cf2281f5a9aa911e24016e2416369626)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>Risk
management plays a vital role for every action whether from individuals,
community or state. A horizon should always be maintained towards monitoring
risk. The role of risk management in the game is to apply and implement the
idea and concept of confronting the risk, preparing for it and to cope with the
effects. The choices to be made range on the focus of development and
allocating resources among the development plan, obtaining knowledge, insurance
and protection as well as the preparation to cope up once the damages occur. Risk
management offers trade-off between risk and return. Given the scarce resources,
wherein every action entails cost, I have to distribute well the resources
among the cost development goals, obtaining knowledge, protection and insurance
and a contingency fund to cope up with damages. Risk management helps in assessing
actions to achieve the goal of increasing the benefits as well as decreasing
the losses. The preparation for risk affects development through the growth
brought about by the development. The positive growth may be sustained even
there are negative shocks when there are enough protection to mitigate risk. It
may also slash or delay its growth when there is no enough preparation for risk
and/or when the preparation for risk does not meet the loss brought about by
the shocks. Preparation for risk may affect development immediately because of
the protection enveloping development although the effect and assessment of
preparation would materialize when the actual shocks occur-depending on the
effect of this shock to the development. </p><p>I played the game several times. For the
first instance, I focus on development (building all the pods), taking for
granted the need to spend resources on knowledge, protection and insurance.
Moreover, I set aside the possibility of loss upholding my high appetite for
risk even without better preparation. I disregard the concept of balance among
these aspects-development, knowledge, protection and insurance as well as
managing damages after the shocks happened. With my succeeding attempts, I
spend my resources on obtaining the maximum protection and insurance. Therefore,
losing the game. After several attempts, I learned that development may not
need to be as fast as I want to or as protected as I want to. Perhaps,
development may be progressive while maintaining on a proactive risk
management. Development needs to be resilient amidst the possibility of loss so
that investment wonâ€™t turn into nothing. Development needs to be back-up by
protection and insurance as well as investing on research to acquire
information to mitigate the loss and to achieve balance between progressive
development and regressive loss brought about by shocks. Furthermore, resources
should always be sufficient to prepare for the unforeseen damages after the
shocks to immediately repair the damages and rebuild the affected community.Risk Preparation needs to
be timely and relevant as shocks and possible loss may happen anytime of the
day.</p><p>With the
recent disaster brought about by the typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines, wherein
knowledge and preparation failed because of the unexpected effect brought about
by the said typhoon, I would add disaster management and disaster response
aspects that would be implemented right after the worst incident when the
unexpected event happen wherein it is beyond the scope of preparation and
anticipated loss. The main goal of this is to immediately respond and manage
the disaster to reduce the number of casualties affected by the aftershocks incident
of the primary disaster. For example, a response to reduce the death tolls out
of hunger and crimes as a result of the destructed community due to typhoon.</p><p>It's better to be prepare than to be surpise.</p></div>
