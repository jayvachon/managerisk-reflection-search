    <h1>Submission 805 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 8088518, session_user_id: d3e816dfddb1cfe28e125e8c2e6ce6661c88689a)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>The game, Risk Horizon, set in the world of Alora teaches us
how risk can be managed with a combination of three factors: Protection,
Insurance and Research (Knowledge). The risk faced in this setting is the
hitting of the comet which is a frequent occurrence in Alora. Knowledge plays
an important role in preparing for the risk and eventually coping with it too. Protection
from this risk can be obtained at a cost by elevating the surface but the cost increases
with more we lift. Insurance helps to reduce the financial burden when the calamity
strikes. Playing the game taught me how to balance the three for development.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Initially, on level 1 when the pod are newly built and a
budget constraint of thousand dollars , it seems a better trade off to get
minimum insurance and invest in protection . Once the pods the put up for upgrade,
it is wise to invest money in protection, the more the better as it is carried
on to next levels whereas insurance needs to be renewed every level. It is
always good to research on comets as it will tell us the severity as well as
chance of hitting more accurately , giving us time to prepare the community
better. As pods become more developed they fetch revenue faster so with
building new pods we need to develop to.</p>

<p>During the initial levels when difficulty is low, building
protection is the key. In my first attempt in the starting a spent my resources
on highest insurance cover rather than building protection. After attempting
the game twice, I learnt that rather than paying for repair after and hampering
development, managing risk by preparation and building protection is the way to
go when developing is the priority.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>When I played the game first time I failed in the first
level as development was lagging behind and time got over. In my second attempt
I started up with minimal insurance, more emphasis on protection and the
studying the severity of comets so as to keep my protection level adequate.
When I was low on resources I started building a new pod as they were cheap and
once enough revenue is collected, I developed the earlier pods.  Development leads to a better economy and
better situation to counter any further calamities.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The game beautifully captures all aspects of basic risk
management. One addition to the game that is possible is taking help from
another world, once in whole of the game whenever required. This will be
parallel to real world situations when other countries provide aid to the country
hit by a disaster. It will act as backup for Alora but only once.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I live in New delhi, India. It is crowded city with 1.68
crore people approx. My city moderate risk of earthquakes meaning in every
10-15 years a major one comes . Education is provided at school level to deal
with an earthquake but there is scarcity of shelters to deal with after effects,
this is basically due to forgetful human nature(forgetting last major quake). A
change that is required in risk management at an infrastructural level.</p>
