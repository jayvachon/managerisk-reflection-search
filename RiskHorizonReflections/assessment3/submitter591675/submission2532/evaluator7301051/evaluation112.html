    <div class="field-value">This reflection is very good in that it explains how, by playing the game, the candidate came to realise that the risk management should serve development rather than being the primary goal unto itself. The author clearly describes the learning curves s/he faced. It would be even better if it didn't focus so much on terminology and descriptions of the game as this is not as relevant as the lessons learned. Also, the organisation is a little bit overwhelming. Breaking the text into paragraphs would be better.</div>
