</p><ol><li><p>I really loved playing this game on risk,
building, evolving, and loosing. It’s a very simple representation of all things
involved in risk management (like external features) with an extra focus on
opportunities (gaining points) and research. Effective <a>risk management</a> is likely to improve
performance against objectives. My strategy: starting with building as much as
possible, earning points, and when possible (=immediate) purchasing the
insurance. You have to build and start earning before you’re able to protect
yourself. But still I didn’t reach further that level 2. Afterwards I learned
doing research at certain times and protecting. It helped a lot. But at that point, you realise that this also has a cost. And you only do it when possible. </p></li><li><p>I learned to stop building at certain times, to
buy insurances and that also help a lot. What helped even more was to start
with an insurance and to build when the collonies were just been hit by meteorites.
When in need of solutions, you’d make sure your were protected and if that was
not possible you made your research count. Research and environment information
is crucial. Plus a motivation to keep going.</p></li><li><p>In an attempt to improve this game I would
explain features when playing, like in the tutorial. I notice that you just want
to start playing without reading the instructions and then you noticed that you
not know how. Another thing I don’t understand is the psychological side of
risk. Is that the reason for having the feedback mostly positive? An extension
of a theory on regulatory focus discussed the difference between two kinds of
focus: on promotion and to avoid failure. The first leading to frustration when
failing, the latter leads has an effect of anxiety. I’m trying to figure out
how it can be related to this game.</p></li></ol><p><span>
