    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value">Risk was central to the game. Achieving success in the game – meeting required levels of development – depended on identifying and assessing different potential risks and levels of threat, and making choices that resulted in an overall strategy for managing those risks effectively based on available resources. 

There were inherent trade-offs between allocating scarce resources – which took the form of both time and money – to acquire either knowledge (which used up time spent on "research"), or "protection" (which cost money itself, but also used time as well as resulting in diminished income generation), or "insurance" (which cost different amounts of money based on the level of insurance purchased). It was also important to have enough money resources to allocate to "development" in order to meet overall objectives there within the given timeframe.

In addition, there were choices about how much to invest in each type of protection based on the precise threat encountered. Given that not all potential threats were realised, one needed to consider not just the size of the threat, but also in the potential for it to actually happen, as well as exactly when it might occur. As such, risk management choices paid off in different ways: "protection" mitigated damage against all threats in a general sense over time (but was relatively expensive), "research" increased capacity to deal with specific and immediate threats as they happened, and "insurance" offered a general way of dealing with the aftermath of a disaster.

I played the game several times, and learned to manage risks better each time. At first I focused on purchasing as much "protection" and "insurance" as possible, but after the first attempts I realised that this strategy meant that I was often unable to prevent damage when a strike did occur, and I also had too few resources left over to invest and reach required levels of development. I therefore adapted my strategy by investing more in "research": this enabled me to prevent damage from occurring after a strike, lessening the need to spend as many resources on costly protection and insurance, and thus also freeing up some resources for development. 

If I were tasked with developing a new version of the game I would adapt it to risks faced in my local context, where issues include health, risks around agricultural production, natural disasters (earthquakes and cyclones), long-term environmental degradation and broader issues of climate change. A more complex version of the game could also incorporate different patterns of development, for example through having different types of community, such as urban and rural, each producing different things and generating different levels of income; it could then also include different types of threats, each with varying consequences for different groups.
