    <div class="field-value">The reflection demonstrates that student had played the game and related it directly to the course reading and presentation materials. The reflection would have been improved if the student had reflected more on the role of insurance as a drain of resources. Furthermore, the example of a change to the game is not fully applicable, as it would be expert individuals in an institution who would research risks, with the management plan designed in cooperation with the community.  </div>
