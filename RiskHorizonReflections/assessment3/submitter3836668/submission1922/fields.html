    <h1>Submission 1922 from Anon (coursera_user_id: 3836668, session_user_id: 7def24e18fe0c2795384ed61618768934f373acb)</h1>
    <div class="field-name" id="81e36f2dbf4473c3">Paste in your short (600-word) essay or link to your short film or video (2-3 minute) on your reflections from the Risk Horizon game.<br><br></div>
    <div class="field-value"><p>What was the role of risk management in the game? The role of
risk management in the game was designed to protect the pods form the effects
of a meteor hitting their world and causing damage. The player could choose
between protective and reactive measures. Research allowed better knowledge about
the risk and severity of the impact. Protection could be build in terms of
upgrading the pods and raising the level of the platform. In my first try I
invested most of the money into raising the platform and building a few pods. I
did research on most of the meteorites and if the chances were high of an
impact with great severity, I also bought the most expensive insurance. I
mostly trade knowledge of for investing in protection and insurance. What did you do differently after the first time? During the
first levels this strategy worked quiet well, but I lost in the fourth level
due to the fact that I ran out of money to protect the pods. I my second try I
build more pods from the beginning and invested more time in research and
upgrading the pods. I hardly spent anything in insurance. This strategy turned
out very well for the game as I made it through all levels without having casualties.
Building all pods and upgrading them, brings enough money to invest in enough protection
to avoid any damage from the meteorites. <span>What change would you propose to better represent the risk management choices that matter in the place you live? </span>The game showed that with enough knowledge
and protection no insurance was necessary. Although I doubt that this situations
reflects very well real world situations. Regions which are struck by natural
disasters often do not have enough capital to invest into so much protection or
knowledge to not need insurance at all. Development is often slow and
especially in developing countries there doesn’t exist much capital to invest
in expensive high tech protection measures. Also you can’t built protection
against everything. I think that the game tried to explain an interesting trade
of/ problem in dealing within risk prone environment, but in my opinion the
risk management process was only brought down to 3 issues, whereas in reality
many more factors need to be considered. I think that case studies of successful/
unsuccessful risk management would have been more useful to understand the
factors involving risk management than playing the game, with this in mind that
quiet a lot of people had problems with the game play as stated in the forums.
I think that it would be interesting to add institutions to the game play, as
in risk management local governments as well as international institutions and
foreign governments play an important role due to the ongoing globalization process. </p></div>
